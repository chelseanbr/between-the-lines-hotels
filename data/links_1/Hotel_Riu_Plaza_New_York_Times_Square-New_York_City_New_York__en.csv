My group of 9 traveled throughout USA between Jan.26 and Feb.10. I organized everything in advance with our distinguished USA guests' assistance and recommendation. Lucky we chose this nice hotel in NYC. And we enjoyed the meal, location and almost one week stay. We were impressed. This hotel location, meals and prices are great. By the way, when we were in USA, we felt very safe to travel around, walk around, there were very few COVID19 cases, while at the same time, there were many in some parts of China and some cities were lockdown and people can not move. How lucky that moment was! But we were so sad to know that just 2-3 weeks later, there were so many cases in NYC, really horrible. We pray hard for people in USA and wish all will go better soon. What we may suggest for other travelers is, stay home and travel later in 2020 due to the pandemic. Worldwide tourism is hardly hit, and Tibet/China tourism is the same. Lets fight together to defeat it.

Rooms are very badly isolated so street noise is permanent all night long, so if you are a light sleeper, this is most certainly not the hotel for you. Room size is in line with the average Manhattan hotel room.Buffet breakfast set up has the feel of a large beach resort (like those of this hotel chain in sunny shores): an endless amount of tables next to each other so that you cannot enjoy a private conversation with your better half, feels like a factory where everything is self-service and of low quality.On the plus side, this hotel is a 2 minute walk to Times Square so if location is important to you, then you may wish to consider this property as an alternative which is probably priced below the average hotel room in that part of town.","London, United Kingdom","nostopping1234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,3.0

The hotel is very clean and modern when we checked in we were allocated a room on the third floor I had requested on my booking through Booking.com a high floor, I mentioned this to reception and was allocated a room on the 19th floor (room 1916) which had a great view.Times Square is a couple of minutes walk away and the hotel is situated on the edge of the Hells Kitchen area with plenty of places to eat. The breakfast is okay but you need to be down early to avoid an over crowded dining room. We booked with booking.com all fees and taxes were included so we had no nasty surprises at checkout.I would definitely return to this hotel, just a couple of tips / recommendations not related to the hotel - if you want to go up to the pedestal at the Statue of Liberty the first 200 people through the ticket office receive a free ticket. We where lucky enough to receive a ticket, the views were excellent. If you fancy watching a show go and see Moulin Rouge we can not rate this show highly enough and would definitely go and see it again. We booked tickets before we travelled as it does get booked up quickly and it is rare to secure tickets from the booths in Times Square.

No mention of giving us a map, local knowledge of the area, the hotel information I.e where the restaurants are, toilets etc. So on we went to our room, room was lovely nice wee space and very contemporary design. The thing I would say is that this hotel is very clean and immaculate. Nobody told us about facility fees until we got to check out which my partner is going to query this as this is false advertising and should be mentioned at check in. We also asked reception where we got the hop on hop off bus as we bought the New York pass for excursions only to be told “I don’t know” I mean seriously?!?! It was only that on our last day we saw the bus literally on the other side of the road is the pick up so folks you know where it is if you are looking for this.

I am absolutely appalled that I am having to write this but we had some bags of shopping stolen from our room. On the evening of the 6th March I noticed one bag of shopping was missing.We had the hotel room upside down searching incase we had miss placed the bag but no nothing - we searched for hours. Inside was personalised gifts we’d had made to take home, they wasn’t overly expensive but they were sentimental items we had bought. After searching for quite some time I was assured they weren’t in the hotel room or on the side where I had originally left them so I called reception to report the issue. I spoke to a lady called Grace on the phone and she said the issue would be taken to management and that housekeeping start at 7am so I would be given an update early the next morning. I didn’t receive any update, but then as I was packing our cases to leave I realised that a Macy’s bag was also missing and again it had items in we had bought to take home. I immediately called reception again and said I’ve just realised a second bag had gone missing. I was then told it had been reported that a second bag had gone missing and that I would be called shortly. We waited in our hotel room for another hour this morning but no phone call. We then went down to reception ourselves and the minute we said our room number to the lady on the front desk a manager was pretty much ready and waiting - funny that?! Clearly was ready and waiting to give us the poor excuses that he did. We spoke to a man called Diego who was the front desk manager who was extremely unhelpful. I was really upset , more or less in tears at the thought that someone had been in our room and taken items. They weren’t expensive as I’ve said but it was the principal that someone thought it was acceptable to take our things we had bought. I explained that we’ve now noticed a second shopping bag had gone missing and he was just rude and extremely unsympathetic. The only answer we received from him was “Our cleaners don’t steal”. As a customer that wasn’t the response I’d have hoped for - the customer service received was terrible. After I pretty much had to beg him for something to be done he looked on the system to find out who had been able to swipe in and out of our room and apparently it was just us and the cleaner. The cleaner apparently said that she didn’t take or throw our bags in the bin which I find extremely odd because things don’t just vanish. Clearly the cleaner wasn’t going to say if she had or hadn’t. Finally the manager agreed to waiver the facility fee of $65.40 as we had to go and re buy the items that were taken - that was about the only thing he did to be helpful. It was made out by him to be all our fault, I should be able to leave things in our hotel room without worrying that someone would take them. He tried to fobb me off with a customer service email address originally - theft is a lot more serious I believe than just a quick email to customer service and this should have been dealt with a lot better than it was and I hope a full investigation is undertaken by the hotel and senior management. This was extremely distressing for us and I wouldn’t ever stay here again. When walking past the cleaners trolly earlier this afternoon there was a key card lying around which wasn’t a good sign either - anyone could have taken this card and accessed peoples rooms. A real shame because the hotel was lovely but what with our things going missing and the lack of customer service we received that was enough for me to not come back - it has made our last day in New York not so nice. If you do stay at this hotel LOCK EVERYTHING AWAY. I will be taking this further with a full complaint.","London, United Kingdom","Oliviaaa555555</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,1.0

When we arrived at the hotel after a long day travelling first impressions of the hotel were good. Very modern reception area and very clean. Check in was ok and pretty quick. They took a hold deposit of $200 for our 2 rooms to cover any breakages etc which incurred whilst there. This was refunded at the end of the holiday and back in my account within 2 days of leaving, bearing in mind we left over the weekend. Our resort fees were included in the cost of the holiday which we booked with TUI and these covered all WIFI usage, bottled water etc in the room. Once checked in we went to our room. I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival and requested 2 rooms next door to each other and on high floor with views. Both of these requests were fulfilled with our rooms being on floor 27. The room was adequate for the amount of time we spent in it. I believe all hotel rooms in NYC are small. There is not a lot of space for clothes with only a small area of wardrobe and 4 small drawers, but we utilised what space we had. Rooms were kept clean by housekeeping staff who cleaned everyday. Breakfast was included in the cost of the holiday. I had read reviews beforehand about breakfast, stating to be down early as after a certain time it became like a cattle market. We were down for breakfast on the first morning at 7am and already it was a free for all. I understand you are in New York and it is hectic all the time but I think a little more organisation would be better. The dining room is like sitting in a school canteen with no ambience and no privacy with tables being so close to each other that you had no privacy to talk to who you were with. Although there is quite a few choices at breakfast, the quality is quite poor for a 4 star hotel. This resulted in us having to have breakfast out of the hotel after only 2 days as we really couldn’t face it any longer. In NYC you expect to be able to eat the breakfast the hotel provide as it does cost a lot of money to go there and the extra expense on top of what you have already paid for isn’t ideal. The hotel is in a great location, only 3 minutes walk to Times Square and also within easy reach of other famous landmarks so can’t fault the location. Some staff are very helpful but some are very rude and make you feel like you are a problem when asking for information or help with anything.

I called booking.com and they advised me no problem, they will take care of it at the hotel, your son will get breakfast. Ha! Clearly they have never stayed here. After paying an extra $50 to check in early, we asked them if they could add a note for 3 breakfast. The staff are a mess. No one seemed to have a clue. They were not friendly and seemed to want to blow us off. The check in man (name escapes me) didn’t know what to do, consulted with a lady who I’m assuming was a supervisor who told him she couldn’t do anything either, and we should talk to Diego, the manager later in the afternoon. We returned as asked and spoke to Samuel who had even less clue than the original guy. He was banging around on his computer for every bit of 5 mins before I said to him do u need our name or room #? We asked for Diego, he said he talked to Diego and now he was handling. He gave us some bull story about it needing to go thru reservations and they hadn’t updated yet etc etc. later that evening we checked back and the next guy had no idea what to do and called the night manager over. She seemed nothing short of put out to be bothered. She tapped away & then said no, we cannot five your son breakfast you have to pay. My husband said he found it remarkable that no one is willing to comp my son a breakfast also, she told us to hang on, went to the end of the desk, picked up a phone then came back & said NO.

The hotel was great and the location is perfect for people looking to explore New York. When we arrived the check in was swift and the staff we’re very polite and helpful. Our room was on the 19th floor. It was a double room which was a little on the small side but this didn’t bother us as we knew we weren’t going to be in there too much. The room was very clean and modern and had a great views looking out onto the city. The bathroom just included a shower, it would of been nice to have a bath to soak in after walking around the city but the shower was very very good so this did make up for it. The room was cleaned daily around 10am we think and they did a great job each day, every time we got back the room was immaculate. Breakfast was good in the hotel plenty to choose from and good standard for a buffet breakfast. Our advise would be to use the fashion bar buffet rather than the main dining hall. It’s much quieter and better suited to couples and has the same choice of food as the main restaurant. We only had to wait to be seated one morning for around about 15 minutes, best to go before 8am if you are awake. Fashion bar is very chilled and night and nice to have a drink in as well. On checked out staff we’re friendly and helpful, after checking out at 12 o’clock we left our bags and collected them two hours later with no hassle. All In all a very good trip made easy due to the hotel experience, would highly recommend.

It was absolutely packed and felt like a school canteen. The food was average and not worth the hassle of the queues! We didn’t bother with breakfast for the remainder of our stay!We visited the bar on two occasions, both times the staff were friendly and the margaritas were very good!We stayed in a junior suite on the 26th floor, no complaints here!

Very accessible to most things in the middle of Manhattan. The hotel is very modern and very clean, the maid would clean and turn the room down daily to a good standard. The room was an ok size for a short break when you spend most of your time out and about! The views from the room were amazing ( we were on the 18th floor) and stayed in room 1814, which was situated on the corner of the hotel giving us spectacular views of 46street and 8th Avenue. In terms of noise, your in New York City it’s not going to be quiet! It sounds like your in the Movies: fire engines, police, taxis beeping however this did not stop any of us from sleeping! Having said that after walking 23,000 steps a day we were out for the count at night! There is a fridge in the room witch the maid replenished with fresh bottles water each day. Only down fall which would have been perfect had it of been available Was coffee and tea making facilities but we got by absolutely fine without. The restroom / toilet was immaculate: clean, tidy, beautifully warm with rainfall shower head or a hand held head which was great for someone like me with long hair. Plenty of storage was available, with a safety deposit box, ironing Board and hangers. The staff: If I am honest this was the hotels biggest downfall! While we was aware some New Yorkers can be rude I would like to say generally we didn’t see much of an issue apart from with the staff at the hotel. They were abrupt at times, appeared fed up and quite rude when speaking “at you” and not to you. This was very evident when entering of queueing for breakfast!

First the hotel is quite modern and stylish. Check in was easy might have got lucky as sometime you walk past reception and it’s rammed due to the numbers checking in. The rooms although on the small side are very nice no tea coffee making facilities but can forgive this. Ice big comfy bed. We were in the 6th floor although we did request something higher it is you get what your given. Great location a few minutes from theatres and time square. Although time square is a nightmare we did our best to avoid it. We were in the half board so breakfast and evening meal included. Breakfast was a large buffet and absolutely crazy so so many people it was all cramped food not the nicest as generally cold. Dinner time not so busy but again food not the warmest. We only ever had tap water with dinner not because we are cheap it’s just the restaurant isn’t a nice romantic place to sit and enjoy a bottle of wine with your dinner. It’s simply full up on food and get out. The hotel charges approx $22 a day on departure for fees. This is WiFi use of the gym and a few bottles of water. You have to pay it regardless if using it or not. You can get a taxi to the hotel at a fixed fee so with a tip looking around $70 the hotel does operate a shuttle service you can book for around $30 each so $60 a couple then the driver expects a tip of 15-20% so more expensive that getting in a yellow cab anyway you choose. The bar is a good place to have a beer but at the prices they charge (all prices in NY are high) there are better bars to try go to 230 5th roof top wow what a place. The biggest issue with the hotel is the noise no not from the traffic outside but the guests doors constantly slamming at all hours. You will be woken up early constantly. Can’t you fit some door closers. New York is a great city to visit with lots to do. Check out my review on NY for some tips. As always would I stay here again. The answer is yes I would.

Yes, Hotel RIU Plaza is only one block away from Times Square. But, what makes Hotel RIU Plaza extra special is that it’s located in the heart of the theatre district on Restaurant Row. There are two major theatre productions on the SAME STREET as the hotel. That means you only have to walk a few feet to get to theatres. It was so nice being able to walk directly to the theatre box office, purchase tickets and eliminate all those online surcharges and fees. If you are in town to catch a show, THIS IS THE HOTEL FOR YOU. If you are not in town to catch a show, this is still THE HOTEL FOR YOU.The staff here is extremely warm and welcoming. I was received by Eladio and he was extremely accommodating. Eladio also assisted me with directions throughout my stay and really ensured that I had a wonderful stay. I arrived at 11:00am and a room was not yet available. This is understandable considering check-out is also at 11:00am. I simply checked my bags, went for lunch and returned at 1:30pm and was given a great room. The hotel is pristine. Hotel staff is constantly cleaning the hotel throughout the day. My room was cleaned and stocked daily and I never had to ask for additional towels, toiletries, etc. Bottled water is provided every other day. WIFI worked wonderfully. My room was located on the 10th floor and despite being close to Times Square, I was able to rest well at night.The buffet, or Theater Buffet as it is appropriately named, is wonderful. Never before have I seen such a lavish array of fresh, high quality foods on a hotel breakfast buffet. There were so many food options, I was able to eat a different breakfast meal every day during my 4-night stay. I still can’t believe this buffet was included.

The bar tenders here really were fantastic and very efficient. Location of the hotel was brilliant, we walked almost everywhere but was close to the subway when we needed it. The only thing that stopped me giving a 5 star review is that it took almost 2 weeks, and a lot of chasing to get my $200 holding deposit back after we had checked out. I was assured upon check out I didnt need to do anything and the money would go straight back into my account. A little disappointing after spending a lot of money on a hotel and causing no damage to the room.

We were on the 22nd floor, our view was nice, nothing amazing but I liked being high up! Especially in NYC! The room was nice and clean, bathroom was modern and sleek, loved the shower! The sliding door wasn’t a problem for us, as we heard a few negative things about this aspect and the door having a gap but the gap is a tiny one at the side so you’ll only see the person in the bathroom if you stand awkwardly near the bed! The room had lots of plugs AND USB ports which we loved! My only negative comment is that they don’t have tea of toffee making facilities in any rooms! Which as we’re brits, we love making a nice tea in the morning! Breakfast was nice, not amazing! But they had options for anybody! A real variety but not amazing quality. We went every morning at about 07:30-08:00 and there was already a few people around so I’d get there as early as you can! I’d avoid 8:30-10! Check in and out was a breeze, lovely staff, very very friendly! We left our luggage on last day as we had a late flight, the bell boy was amazing!

When at the reception the lady dealing with the room went on to say how busy it was and wished she wasn’t there which we could tell by her attitude towards us.

They were able to check us early in our room and upgraded us to a king bed instead of a queen. This made our trip start out wonderful. The breakfast buffet included with the room was the best I have ever seen. I will definitely stay at RIU every time I go to New York. Only a couple of blocks from Times Square.

It was clean, but small. But this is NYC and most hotel rooms are known for being small. We stayed on the 22nd floor and had a cool view of the surrounding buildings (see photos) We could see a bit of the lights from Times Square from our window, but the black out curtains did the trick. About a block from Times Square and an easy walk to Rockefeller Center as well! The walls to the bathroom are glass. You can’t see all the way through but you can see shadows of the person inside. It was fine since I was just with my daughter but that could be awkward depending on who you are with. Also, because of this, if someone uses the bathroom the light shines through to the bed, which could disturb others while sleeping. I’m not sure why it’s designed this way. It’s weird. Breakfast was simply ok. It was edible,But nothing super fabulous. We weren’t there for the food though.

Check in was easy and straightforward, however very little information or advice regarding hotel services or local services given to us by reception. Needed $300.00 to hold as deposit, which we didn’t know about when we booked via British Airways. We knew about the Facility Fee, but didn’t know about having to leave a deposit. Took our own bags up to our room, and freshened up before exploring. Very little storage space except for the under the bed storage (which I did not want to use), however room was very clean, modern and bright. And most importantly for me there was laminate flooring throughout the room instead of carpet, which gave it a much cleaner feel!! Lovely views from floor to ceiling windows.Water bottles are put in room alternate days. Hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square. We had booked breakfast as part of the package, however wasn’t told that there was 2 places to eat for breakfast. Instead we were told breakfast was in the Theatre Buffet Restaurant. The setting kind of ruined our breakfast experience, as it resembled a very tightly packed school canteen with everyone sitting closely together. On our last day, we heard about a second restaurant that opens for breakfast the Fashion Cafe. We were told that the buffet restaurant is suited to groups whilst the fashion cafe is better suited to couples. I wish we were told about this at the start of our stay, as this restaurant was much more civilised with more space and felt more “holiday” like rather then just a noisy school canteen. Food was the same in both - usual hotel breakfast buffet food - bacon eggs sausages etc. Nothing wrong with the food, however due to the location of the hotel, I doubt I would bother with breakfast here if I stayed again, as there are so many places to eat outside the hotel which was much tastier!! WiFi in hotel was fast. Check out was simple, and they released the deposit minus the Facility Fee. As part of the Fee, is baggage hold after check out, so we was able to explore further before having to leave for the flight.Hotel arranged our taxi to airport, which was no cheaper then the yellow cab we got from the airport to the hotel on our first day. But I think there is a flat airport fee.Would definitely stay here again if staying in NYC, minus the breakfast.

I booked, and paid for a room with 2 queen beds, and requested a high floor. I got a single room on the 11th floor.. On querying this with reception I was met with a curt the hotel is full but they would see what they could do the following day. This effectively ruined our first night in New York. Day 2 I had 2 further discussions with the reception staff and eventually was offered an accessible room with a sofa bed There was no apology and no offer of even a free drink at the bar for our inconvenience. Unfortunately this was not my only issue. On the third day we were going to Washington and therefore had an early start. The restaurant for breakfast was full and therefore because we was on a tight schedule I asked if we could just grab a couple of muffins to go. This was rudely refused and I was told that if any food was taken out of the restaurant it would be chargeable. When I asked what difference it made the waitress was unable to answer.

I've stayed in a number of 4 star hotels in the US and elsewhere and this one would, for me, be more of a 3 star. Nothing bad in that at all, just be aware of what you are getting (and, more importantly, what you are not getting).We booked a deluxe family double room with sofabed for our family of 5 (three boys aged 13,11 and 8), thinking that this would be sufficient for us for 3 nights. The room itself was adequate, but small, particularly when housing 5 people. Fair enough - our fault, not the hotel's. On reflection we should have booked a suite or interconnecting rooms, but you live and learn. The room was clean and had beds, a TV and a bathroom, but that's about all I can say that's positive. No tea or coffee making facilities and, whilst there were two bottles of water in the mini fridge, these were never replenished, despite there being a notice on the fridge that water would be replaced every other day. The bathroom had a sliding glass door and a frosted glass wall between the shower and the bedroom - very funky and possibly quite fun depending on the occupants of the room, but a bit of a shock all round in our case! Again, nothing against this but something to be aware of.Breakfast, which was included, was good. A bit of a battle to the death (tongs at dawn) with other patrons, but the food was decent enough, the range was very good (cooked, continental, fruit, cereals, breads, etc.) and we all filled up splendidly.Overall, the hotel itself is fine. The rooms are small, but I guess that is to be expected in a city centre hotel. The position is great and breakfast was very welcome.What really lets this place down, in my opinion, is the front of house staff, with a couple of notable exceptions (in particular, the lady who checks people in for breakfast, serves in the cafe and probably does half a dozen other things in between). The check in staff were surly and unaccommodating and, I found, a bit snippy. Not what you want as the first introduction to the hotel. But the worst culprit is the ""Fashion Bar"". This place needs a rocket. Three times as many bar staff as they currently have on might go some way to improving the service. Customer service training for the waiting staff would go the rest of the way. Something along the lines of actually looking to serve customers rather than hanging out and chatting with other members of staff would be a start. We waited for over 30 minutes to get a round of drinks, and that would have been longer had I not gone over to the bar to collect the drinks myself. This is a particular bugbear of mine, but if you are going to offer cocktails in a bar, have other bar staff who can serve the rest of the drinks, otherwise you hold up everybody else simply because someone wants a Manhattan. To sum up, this could be a good hotel if the staff were properly trained in how to handle guests (surely not rocket science, given that this is the establishment's raison d'être). The rooms are fine (so long as you understand what you have booked), the breakfast is good, the position is great. But there is literally nothing that will colour the mood more than to be kept waiting for a drink after a hard day's sightseeing and shopping. Inexcusable. I would not stay here again.","Hertfordshire, UK","Jimbob03</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hertfordshire, UK</strong>",3,3.0

The hotel lobby is frequently packed with people, so be forewarned that you may have a bit of a wait to check in or out. Staff are generally friendly and accommodating, with an exception or two here and there, but overall are quite nice. Rooms vary greatly in size but even the small ones are large enough for two people. They're tastefully decorated in a somewhat spartan Euro-style, but quite nice.

The front desk staff we spoke to were all lovely and super helpful, check in and out was quick and efficient and they were happy to hold our luggage for us on the last day as we weren't collected until 2pm.This hotel was booked as part of a package deal with TUI so all the taxes and additional costs were already covered, we just paid $100 security deposit when we checked in and it was refunded immediately when we left.Room was small and basic but immaculately clean and the King bed (Super King to us in the UK) was really comfortable. Bathroom was a good size with lovely walk in large shower, the only thing I wasn't keen on was the glass frosting between the shower and your room so if you wanted to get up in the night and turn the light on it illuminated the bedroom and woke up the person you're staying with. Also the glass door was a strange sliding one which doesn't close properly with a large gap of at least an inch ore more either side so if you want to hear your partner/friend on the toilet then that's great - wasn't my favourite feature though!The location was perfect, just 1 block from Times Square and within easy walking distance of all mid Manhattan plus the piers on the West side for the Circle Line cruises and Intrepid Land, Sea and Space museum.We decided to have a drink at the bar on our last night and were surprised to find we could get a nice bottle of prosecco for just $33, much cheaper than elsewhere we stopped at!I would definitely stay in this hotel again if I revisit New York.","Colchester, United Kingdom","BreezeAM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colchester, United Kingdom</strong>",27,5.0

These include:* Location - it's right in the heart of Midtown and most of the time you can get a yellow cab or an Uber in a matter of minutes.* Staff - everyone we met was helpful and friendly.* Breakfast - this is served in two rooms (we preferred the Fashion Café – you can choose whichever you like) and has a very good range of choices. It's pretty loud and lively, though!* Rooms - adequately sized with new-ish decoration and decent beds, though hardly large (we had a family room).The not so good stuff:* The hotel lobby is a really busy place, with lots of tourists in and out wheeling luggage all the time. Because of this, it takes something away from the pretty cool decor and strips the place of any sense of elegance it may have.* Views looking to the west, as many seemed to do, are a bit disappointing – no matter what floor you're on.* Bedroom walls aren't great in terms of noise-proofing.As for the oft-mentioned and much complained-about shower wall being semi-transparent, this absolutely is not a problem – even with teenage kids – if you simply turn off the light in the bathroom when someone is in there. There is more than enough light getting into the bathroom through that semi-transparent wall for anyone in the bathroom to see what they are doing, and no embarrassing shadows can be seen by people in the bedroom.On a related note, and in anticipation of the dreaded 'gap' between the bathroom wall and the door which some people here have talked about, we took a two-inch cutting off a £4 IKEA paper window blind and basically hung that in the gap (weighted down by a bulldog clip). It worked a treat and provided some extra privacy. An easy fix!While I definitely didn't love this place, it was certainly an excellent base and we felt perfectly safe walking around at all hours. I would say the location, the breakfast and the staff go a long way to making the Riu Plaza a serious contender for a mid-priced Midtown hotel.",Bordeaux,"RoamingADay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bordeaux</strong>",26,4.0

Some of a better quality than others but a good start to the day.The staff were all pleasant and the girls at breakfast were very friendly.A couple of slight negatives. One being that, as a riu member and after emailing the hotel twice that it was my mothers big birthday on our trip, the hotel didnt recognise this in any way at all. And two, the charge they put on at check out of over 20 dollars per night for wifi, water and the gym... it's a little steep tbh. The hotel organised transport to the airport for us in a huge comfortable car for a flat rate of 75 dollars, which, after tolls and tip etc was the same as th yellow cab we took from the airport, but much more luxurious. Took us over two hours to get back to jfk though, so make sure you leave ample time as traffic was horrendous. Overall a fabulous stay in a very bright and modern hotel in a great location in NYC.

The hotel was very busy when we stayed and check in and check out had queues, but staff got through them quickly and efficiently. The rooms were clean and comfortable, my only complaint is that they maybe a little small but that’s to be expected in New York hotels, it’s not a big factor as there is so much to do in New York that so little time is spent in the room.

Staff very friendly and helpful too.Check in/out could get quite busy at certain points, there appeared to be lots of groups arriving/leaving which seemed to give rise to the queues.Rooms are typical NYC, not huge, but cleverly you can store your luggage under the bed, which frees up a huge amount of space.There is a fridge in the room which is great to keep some snacks and drinks in. They do provide water every other day, but this seemed hit and miss and fell foul of my usual criticism of only putting 2 bottles in sometimes, despite there being 3 of us.Views from our room were fantastic (we could actually see Intrepid) and all the rooms are centred around a central lift shaft, meaning walks from lifts to rooms are not bad at all. Lifts can get very busy at peak times though.One point to note, for some reason, someone thought it was a good idea to put an opaque glass wall in the bathroom. It looks fantastic, but if you are travelling with a young child you can’t really use the bathroom lights once they are asleep, as it pretty much lit the room up like Blackpool. Same in middle of the night if someone needs the bathroom.... if this wasn’t the case, this would have been a 5 star property in our opinion.The hotel is in a brilliant location, close to Times Square and near enough to subway etc. Makes a great base to explore from, pretty central.One superb feature is the inclusive breakfast. It is similar to a standard all inclusive breakfast, lots of bacon, eggs, sausages, fruit, cereals etc. Also hot drinks and juice. A great way to fuel up for your adventures and saves a fortune based on NYC prices. It does get busy, they give you a guide to busy times, just be aware and don’t say you weren’t warned!!For any Brits, there is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, however, there is a Dunkin Donut across the street which did tea and coffee at a reasonable price and if you did the surveys each day you could get a free donut to go with it... half decent tea too!! Also a Duane Reade one block up, to stock up on snacks!The bars in the hotel, especially the courtyard bar, were nice and welcomed children.

Breakfast choice was huge which included cereals, fruit, yoghurts, pastries and cooked breakfast items. Very nice breakfast. Staff within the restaurant were lovely too. It is quieter in the restaurant to take breakfast after 10am. The hotel is in an ideal location 4 mins from Times Square. It’s also near to the subway making trips out so easy. There is a food street vendor van just outside the hotel. I ate there once and it was good. We also ate in the hotel buffet for dinner $35pp one evening the food was good, we didn’t get to eat there again as there were so many places to eat in that area, you will never go hungry. If you go to NYC stay at the Riu Plaza New York you won’t be disappointed, would we stay there again? Oh yes definitely .

The corridors were very noisy at night but that is not really the hotels fault, just inconsiderate customers. My only issue was the mirror. There were no plugs next to the full length mirror and where the desk was positioned, there were plugs but no mirror despite there being space for one. I had to set up my makeup mirror on the bedside table and sit on the floor to do my hair.The breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of choice.

B from customer services replied to our email with a very prompt and friendly reply and much to our relief informed us that the Riu Plaza only uses synthetic material in their bedding. We had a late flight on 25th September and a long wait at JFK security so we didn't arrive at the Riu Plaza until around 11:30pm. The lobby was sleek and stylish and very welcoming. It was almost 5am UK time, so we were both feeling extremely tired but the wonderful Eladio at the check in desk made the process a very swift and enjoyable one. We had an issue with our credit card (completely their fault and not the hotel) and Eladio was discreet and professional as we rectified the issue.Upon entering our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was larger than we had anticipated, we had heard that rooms in NYC are notoriously tiny.Our room was modern, had a lovely shower room and was spotlessly clean. There was an ample sized wardrobe for our short stay, an iron and board, large tv and also a small fridge. It really did have everything we could need! Our room was located on the 15th floor and we weren't disturbed by any of the noisy hustle and bustle of the busy Manhattan streets. Housekeeping were very quiet as they made their way through the hallways in the mornings and they did a fantastic job of making up our room.Our check out was just as swift and smooth as our check in and the friendly bellhops kindly stored our luggage away as we had an 6 hour gap between check out and our transfer pick up.If we are ever lucky enough to return to New York, we will without a doubt be booking to stay here again as we just couldn't fault the location, staff and beautiful rooms.Thank you Hotel Riu Plaza New York Times Square for making our stay such a memorable one.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","Alana N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, United Kingdom</strong>",15,5.0

Facilities are fine- but there are nicer hotels in the area for same cost. In particular the customer service is AWFUL! Joanne, a manager, who i noticed has come up several times (poorly) in reviews of the hotel needs to be retrained. I had unintentionally left my keys in the hotel room- and realized when i was returning home- which, i get it, totally my fault. But the experience i had because of the hotel made the situation much worse. First representatives at the hotel said to call back an hour later to speak to ""cynthia"" who when i called back, i was then informed she had left for the day (3:30p) and to call back in 15 minutes to speak to another manager. When i called back again (but a manager was not available) I was informed that the policy was that i had to arrange a pickup with fedex- that the hotel would not assist (which again, fine, but it could have been handled better). I sort it with fedex to pickup between a 2 hour time period, get my tracking number etc and call back and arrange for the hotel to print out the shipping label. The hotel representative ( which id spoken to about at least 4 different people at this point) first gave me an incorrect email- so I call back again (2.45 minutes have passed at this point), I forward the shipping label with a representative from the hotel on the phone to confirm it is received. The Hotel representative states that everything is all set.Next day i do not receive my keys and am informed by fedex that they went to the hotel and the shipping label was not provided and they could not pickup. This is just bad business, and on top of it, the people i spoke to were beyond rude. Leaving the keys behind was my error. But I did everything requested by the hotel, and after spending a lot of money to stay- I was incredibly insulted as to how i was treated and that some inept people left me in a really bad situation where i could not get into my car or home for 48 hours because they would not assist me. I called to speak to the manager Joanne hoping to make her aware of this error, and instead was met with aggression and a very unprofessional individual. When i was explaining the situation she yelled over me and said i would get the keys tomorrow. No apologies were given, instead she used a tone that a customer service personnel should never use. She either hates her job, is bad at it- or both.",,Frances D,4,1.0

We felt that this fee should be included in the rate. That being said, I might stay here again but I would take the additional $20 fee into account when comparing rates. Also, ask for a high floor with the west facing view if you want a beatiful view of the Hudson and NJ.

The surprising disappointment was no tea/coffee making facilities in the bedroom - especially in a hotel of this calibre. Breakfast was included and buffet style - a bit canteen like and although food was freshly prepared ( for buffet style!) it wasn’t to a great standard. New York itself was as to be expected. The location of the hotel is excellent for majority of popular sites and we could walk everywhere. Just as well as we visited during the UN Convention and city roads were gridlocked.

To start with the hotel does have some positives. The breakfast was excellent and fresh every morning, a great addition to the hotel. Ok now the issues we had. The room was nice and clean, however we were put on a floor with a group of school children. Now as a teacher I completely understand children can get excitable on a trip to NY. However we were kept up most of the night with doors banging from the running between rooms. They were shouting and clearly the staff had no control....from what I thought! We called security on a number of occasions but nothing changed. The next morning we went to speak to the manager. They would not come out to speak to us. Clearly not important enough or did not feel a customer with an issue was worth speaking to? After speaking to a receptionist I was shocked to find out that the school staff were 5 floors above the group of students? Why??? No answer. Just the way it was allocated......??? We had a number of nights like this and the hotel refused or could not be bothered resolving it. Not what I would have expected from a Riu hotel. This unfortunately spoiled our holiday as most nights we were kept awake and were tired the next day. I am sorry this could not have been resolved in a better way but again we asked to speak to the manager on checkout to give feedback but they would not speak to us, even when the receptionist went to their office to ask. So we left we left the hotel feeling we were not listed to or felt valued. We will not be returning to the hotel nore reccomend anybody to stay at this hotel.

The neighborhood is lively but not inconveniently so and it's pretty close to everything. There's a good number of really good restaurants and coffee shops around. The building is pretty nice as well, it's in a great state of repair. Meanwhile, the front office staff are definitely the rudest I've dealt with in New York. By rude, I really mean ""rude"" not the direct and curt manner of New Yorkers. When I wrote this comment on Google Maps, the hotel's online reputation manager responded by a tirade of denials and used the term ""lament"" that it's not my impression that their staff is highly trained.I'll give a couple of a few examples that happened with me, on the second of my stay day I needed to inquire about something, I went down to the lobby and I saw a man named ""Rashin"", he was free and had no calls nor was he talking to any person. I greeted him ""good morning"" his response was not even verbal, he raised his index at me as in ""shut up"" or ""wait"" then went to the back talking with someone and after five minutes he returned just staring at me. My initial response was ""I said good morning"", then I asked my question.Another example was a customer service woman, she didn't have a name tag. She was handing over some packages to me, she was just being the most difficult and unhelpful.During my stay, I had a business partner staying at the hotel in another room and he also complained about the front office staff. I haven't read other comments regarding the attitude, however, it could be that my business partner and I were targeted because we're from the middle east.Meanwhile, the restaurant staff is just amazing and very courteous, they handle so many clients at the same time with the same polite efficiency. The breakfast itself is really good. As much as I enjoyed the location I don't think I can ever stay there again nor recommend it to Egyptians or Arabs in general.","Cairo, Egypt","mirox9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cairo, Egypt</strong>",33,3.0

Our stay overall was pleasant & fun! Firstly the location is fantastic! Within walking distance of time square but not too close to the crazy ness/ hustle’n’bustle. The lobby is beautiful & has a lovely scent. The rooms are quite small, but for a couple over 2 nights was just fine. The hotel is modern, the decor is pretty & the room had everything you’d need for a short stay. There is small fridge for use, which was handy for drinks & fruit etc. Most hotel in NYC charge for a fridge, so this place was great with the fridge already included, as well as 2 bottles of water. We did have a small issue with our housekeeping, however this was handled well by Sarah at the Front Desk. She was efficient, pleasant & the matter was resolved. Buffet breakfast was included in our stay... it was satisfactory, with all the general options available. There were two restaurants which guests can choose to sit in during the breakfast hours. However one of the restaurants shuts an hour earlier than the other, a lot of guests didn’t seem to be aware of this. Perhaps it should be posted somewhere or have a little sign to advise breakfast goers. Overall a pleasant stay, fabulous location, clean rooms with a nice touch of colour. If I could give any advice to the hotel (especially if booked/noted in advance) it would be nice to acknowledge special occasions as this means a lot to the guest/s and is likely to be remembered when booking in the future.

The RIU was chosen by us as we’ve stayed in numerous RIU hotels around the world & love them.The Plaza did not disappoint.Check in was quick and easy. We had to give our credit card on check in where they “hold” $150. $52 (ish) was taken on check out for hotel tax & the rest refunded. We were given 2 room keys (cards) and headed up to floor 25. The room wasnt too small, infact it was great. We had a double bed,a wardrobe, a fridge, a desk and a wall mounted TV. Plenty of walk space around the room. There are no coffee making facilities in the rooms. There is a hair dryer mounted on the wall in the bathroom. An iron and ironing board. And a safe in the wardrobe.The bathroom was a reasonable size with a walk in shower, toilet and sink. Hand cream and soap were provided and also shampoo in the shower. It’s frosted glass separating the bathroom and the bedroom.The maid changed towels everyday, made the bed & re-stocked the fridge with water. The time of day varied when the maid came to the room from morning to late afternoon.The hotel is situated around 3 minutes walk from Time Square and around 15 min walk from the Empire State Building.Our board basis at the hotel was half board which was great as we found eating out to be expensive in NY, we knew we would be set up for the day eating breakfast. We never had to queue up and got seated straight away. It’s a standard RIU breakfast, which was good enough. Cereals, bacon, sausage, toast etc We had 1 evening meal in the plaza which was ok. To be honest I’d have been disappointed if we’d have had to have paid ($35 pp) if we weren’t half board.The lobby was immaculate and was a nice place to sit before heading out for the day or on arriving back from a day out.... We took advantage of the fashion bar “happy hour” ($8 cocktails instead of $14) a couple of times - it was lovely sitting in the little courtyard at the end of a busy day or sitting by the window just watching NY go by for an hour... The hotel staff are really nice & very friendly.Our flight home was late at night and because we wanted to sight see until last minute RIU allowed us to have our room until 3pm (we have a RIU gold card so got this for free, it’s usually $40) After 3pm that we left our luggage with the bellboys, you have until 11pm to collect it.

The breakfast is included, and the dining area is just by the elevators, this does cause chaos, as breakfast is extremely busy, and you have to queue where people are also trying to queue for elevators! The breakfast is great, loads of choice, fresh and hot, but it is chaotic!!! And tables are very close together! But still worth the hassle!Our room was on the 12th floor, a superior queen, nice, bright, modern and spacious, large walk in shower, with glass walls! Can’t see through them though from the bedroom lol ! Fridge, iron, hairdryer, but no coffee making facilities!!!

Choosing a hotel in New York is no easy task as there are hundreds of them. But we went for Riu for number of reasons really, you know Riu as quality and expect this to be carried through all locations. The Riu is also one of the few hotels to offer bed and breakfast. Also the daily tax is one of the lowest in New York at the Riu Plaza. We made the right choice anyway, the hotel was lovely, clean and modern if a little hot and stifling in the room at times.

It worked well having 2 separate sleeping areas and the bathroom situated in the lobby between, the lobby also had a small fridge that was useful to chill drinks and snacks.Hotel was in a great location, very central and easy to walk to many of the famous landmarks.We used the breakfast buffet every day, we didn’t have to wait at all and there was a good selection of food and drink. It was a bit chaotic at times and the tables are too close together making access difficult at some tables.As we were in a suite we had access to the Executive Lounge on floor 26 with free soft drinks, wine, snacks and pastries. This was a very nice addition to our stay and was nice to have a relaxing glass of wine before going out for dinner.We ate at the hotel one evening, if you purchase on the day it is $35 per person. Again it is buffet style and there was a reasonable selection of all courses, drinks are extra. I think whether you feel this is value for money depends on how much you eat, there were lots of restaurants nearby if you haven’t paid for half board on booking.We really enjoyed staying in the hotel my one negative is on the layout of the bathroom and toilet which doesn’t seem very well thought out. Given the suite can accommodate up to 6 it would be more sensible to have a sink in with the separate toilet rather than having 2 in the shower area - if someone is in the shower you cannot wash your hands, so if there is every any remodelling it would make this space far better.","Norwich, United Kingdom","919helens919</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwich, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

It was our first time in NYC and we had searched online for ages before deciding to pick the Riu Plaza. One of the main things we had been impressed with on the online reviews was everyone mentioning how clean the hotel is. We were also pleased to hear that Breakfast was included for most bookings.On arrival at the hotel, check-in was efficient and friendly enough. The elevators are excellent and you rarely have to wait more than about 1 or 2 minutes, even at the busiest of times. The elevators are very secure as you have to use your room key to select your floor before it moves.The room was small and basic, but it was very clean and that was the important thing. We knew that rooms would be small as NYC is known for this. We had 2 double beds, a fridge, a small desk and a wall-mounted TV. Cupboard space was sufficient, but there were no dresser drawer units to store any clothes which did not require hanging. As a result of this we had to live out of our suitcases which fortunately fit under each bed (lots of dirt and dust under the beds by the way). There would have been enough space to put some drawer units in, either by the side of the beds or by the desk, so perhaps the design of the rooms could have been better in terms of making use of the space.The bathroom was small but modern, with a large shower unit but no bath-tub. There is a lot of counter space by the basin and under the basin which was useful for storing toiletries etc.Breakfast was generally good for us. It didn't matter what time in the morning you went there, it was always busy, but once again this was not a major issue as everyone seemed to get seated within a few minutes of arriving. The quality of the food at breakfast was pretty good. Cereals, fruits, yoghurt, hot drinks, hot cooked food, pastries, muffins and various other breakfast items were available. Things only really went downhill when you arrived at breakfast in the latter part of the sitting. Food stopped being replenished and you had to ask the staff if things could be refilled. Sometimes certain items (pastries and muffins mostly) would completely run out, so you did not have the full choice expected. Also, during the last hour of breakfast, as the restaurant is split into two sections, they would close one section which meant that the food choices were also impacted as both sides did not always have the same items. For example, only side of the restaurant would have Lucky Charms. The staff in the restaurant, particularly the bus-boys were friendly and always seemed to appreciate it when you thanked them, which is something most people did not seem to do. The hotel has a small business centre which allows you free access to PC's and a printer. This was useful for printing out our boarding passes for our flight home. Also the WiFi service throughout the hotel was very good, although we could only connect with 2 of our 3 devices for some reason.The location of the hotel was excellent. Lots of good eateries close by and it generally felt very safe and secure. It was an easy walk to various sights such as Times Square, the Rockefeller Centre, Central Park and Macys/Empire State. There are quite a few subway stations close by to choose from, so all in all we found this a very convenient location.Housekeeping was good in terms of the room being cleaned well. It was slightly irritating that we had to ask for our toiletries to be re-stocked as this seemed to be somewhat inconsistent. Also, the hotel seems to promote the idea of 2 bottles of water being provided every other day in your room. Well, a) if you have 3 people in the room, would it not be better to provide 3? b) the water was NEVER restocked and every other day I needed to go to reception and ask for the water which had not been provided as it should have been. Most of the time this was not a problem and the receptionist would go to the back office and bring out 2 bottles of water, but on one evening when I did this, the guy on reception seemed to be really reluctant to help. I virtually had to instruct him to go to the back where the other better receptionists had been to in order to get some water. This should not be a big deal and don't want to blow it out of proportion, but if the place advertises this feature then it should be provided. How much is a bottle of water, bought wholesale by these big companies??? And yet they seem reluctant to hold up their side of the deal!Anyway, we enjoyed our stay here and would hopefully return. The only issue may be the high prices which are charged. Our 7 night stay in May/June for a basic double room was around $3000. This may be a factor which causes us to try elsewhere.","Hawkwell, United Kingdom","TonyH1973</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawkwell, United Kingdom</strong>",35,4.0

We arrived at the Riu Plaza as the first stop on our honeymoon and because the room was not yet available we left our bags in their luggage storage and after a day in NY we returned in the evening to take possession of the room. But when they handed back our bags we realized that the handle of one of them was practically uprooted and dangling! The porter immediately admitted, apologizing, that the handle of the suitcase had broken when he lifted it. Once in the room we realized that the others also had damage. One was skinned and another was scratched and bruised. An unmistakable sign that they had been badly guarded.I immediately reported the incident to a manager, who assured me that he would make an investigation to understand what had happened and would let me know. The following day and the next one, however, I always spoke with a different person and they all replied that they would let me know also why they had to call insurance. After three nights I left this hotel but continued to solicit a response through my tour operator. Each time I was told that they still had to watch the footage of that morning's cameras (not even the NASA) despite the fact that I had communicated from the start date and time of my arrival at the hotel. After 10 days, impatient, I demanded an answer and here is the prank! They replied that from the images viewed (?) to them it would turn out that the handle and the wheel (what?) of the suitcase were already broken and even insinuating that of this the guest was aware at the time of delivery! As for the scratches there was no way to prove that they had been made there. All a staging to avoid compensating an actual damage caused by less than $ 100!

The rooms weren't very big, the bathroom was nice although it was separated from the bedroom by frosted glass, which may not be to everyone's taste. The dining hall was extremely busy and one morning they told us we had to wait for the other members of our party before we could get a table. The food was OK, nothing to go mad about and after a few days, it became boring and we wondered whether we should have booked breakfast for six days rather than finding other places for breakfast. The staff were polite, the bell boys were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is a short walk from Time Square. We thought we had paid for the booking of the two rooms before we arrived but found that we had only reserved the rooms after giving a credit card; we then found that we were charged more due to taxes which we thought we had paid and a reception fee? Would recommend other people double check everything before they go as we booked through Booking.com only to find we did have hidden charges. The dining hall was very loud and chaotic and as so many tables were crammed in, this made it difficult to keep manouvering around to get to the buffet. There was another dining area which closed early so if you want a quieter dining experience, I would recommend setting your alarm to get there before they close. Outside was a food vendor who sold coffee as well, there were no facilities in the room for making coffee or tea, so if you are an early riser, you have to either find McDonalds or Starbucks or use the guy outside the front of the hotel for a coffee to wake you up as the restaurant and cafe does not open until 7am.","Perth, Australia","vp662016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",3,3.0

You drop a good few K on this and you expect a bit of above and beyond. We received neither.Firstly, the location of this hotel is pretty cool. Just a couple mins walk to Times Square, and convenient to eat in Hell's Kitchen.Now the service. As above, this is the best room in the place sooooo ....1 Having to ask three times for slippers. A small point but please don't try to persuade we don't have the right to them2. Water. I mean, come on. We're paying thousands of dollars and you don't keep the promise to have a few bottles of water topped up? Even the sign says it's replenished every two days. We just bought our own.3. Special occasion. There were signs around the place saying how this hotel seeks to go beyond. So my GF mailed before arrival to request just a little recognition of my 50th. Nada. She even telephoned on top to request so it's not as if the e-mail went west.4. Oh, and the lie. So not a big deal but the bell hop swore blind the NYC taxi to JFK was metered and offered the house cab. I was convinced the fixed NYC <> JFK was fixed fare but didn't want to argue the point so just got the house cab. Upon my return I looked it up and surprise, surprise, I was right ... Please don't allow a customer to lose confidence in your establishment due to clear untruths.5. Breakfast. It's like a school canteen. Seriously. The food quality was particularly poor (for example, hard bacon, cold and extremely un-cool eggs).6. Ate in the bar first night and ordered some croquettas. Options for ham / whatever. Specifically stated several times NO chicken. After having eaten one ... you guessed it :-)7. The exec lounge. It's the funniest lounge. Teensy weensy.Anyhow, all minor points add up to bad juju. We stayed in many Riu hotels in Europe, and none as bad as this for overall service. Oh, and I mean many, many stays over the years. I truly hope our next visit to a Riu in Europe is aligned in terms of quality to this, i.e. hope it's an American thing as opposed to a chain.Still, on the plus side it's in a pretty cool location :->(BTW, we won't be staying again, so please no comments about next time we'll up our game, or give us a call to discuss.

The hotel was very nice, the beds were very comfortable (I don't usually sleep too well when away) and the overall impression was positive. If possible, ask for a high room on the side overlooking the river, the view is spectacular. The only downside would be the food in the restaurant in the evening. It was a buffet for $35 which is good value, unfortunately I found the choices to be very limited. However, the hotel is situated on Restaurant Row and there are loads of good places to eat just outside the front door, so the hotel food wasn't really a problem. The hotel itself is in a prime position, only one block away from Times Square and the hustle and bustle that goes with it. If you fancy a show try the ticket office in Times Square and see what they have for that day - the tickets there are a great deal cheaper, so worth a look. From the hotel it took 15 minutes to walk to Central Park and about 25 minutes to walk down to to the piers where most of the boat tours go from. The one thing I would suggest is, don't forget your brolly or fold up rain mac - when it rains, it rains!!!!! The weather is also very humid.

The frosted glass mentioned in earlier reviews is odd but we didn’t have the light on when showering and so it didn’t present any issues with privacy. We just worked around it. The breakfast was fab. Reception suggested we eat in the fusion restaurant rather the the main dining room which was much more relaxed. I don’t think this would be suitable for families with small children but was great for us with our teenage daughter. Main selling point for this hotel is location. We used the subway to get to lower Manhattan, walked upto Central Park which was not far.

Water was replaced in the fridge every day except for our last full day before we departed. For some reason it didnt happen, maybe a cost cutting thing.On a previous review someone mentioned about the shower door leaking, which also happened to us.The staff were extremely helpful especially Jose, who is a barman. Give this man a huge pay rise, he deserves it. He helped us out with lots of stuff including local information, tipping, and just a nice friendly guy.Downside was out your operator told us we could pay the local hotel tax with our TUI travel mastercard, which was incorrect. That was the only reason we had a travel card, but the cafe attached, which is also excellent, takes it.The hotel also got us a large black SUV to take us back to JFK for $75 including tip, as we did not want another yellow cab. This price was on a par if not cheaper, with Uber, so the hotel won.The breakfast food is plentiful but fails on presentation. I could not recognise the fried eggs as they seemed to go for bulk not style.

The hotel was reasonably priced for the city. Very close to walk to Times Square and to the show we saw (two blocks). The breakfast that comes with the room was blah. I think Europeans would like it because it’s a lot of croissants, bread, meats, pastry, fruit. Oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurt. I’m not a big fan of buffets, so I didn’t eat too much.

However, a week after my booking the same room, at the same time, appeared at $400 cheaper! I did email the hotel and ask why this was, but the reply in no way addressed my query. The reply suggested the price of the room varied depending on the time of year I booked - not relevant to my query.

The room was very compact (2 doubles and a sofa bed) but we had seen photos and were expecting that. The problem was with the bathroom. The frosted glass wall meant you couldn’t have the light on in the bathroom or people in the room could clearly see you. Bigger issue was the toilet. We thought it would be separate to the bathroom but wasn’t. Worse the sliding door design left a significant gap, leaving you fully on show. This was a huge issue staying with family so we spoke to reception about it. Only option we were given was to book an extra room (at full price) so people could use the bathroom in privacy. Doubling our hotel bill was never going to be an option. Would have been a great stay but 5 mornings of showering in the dark and using the hotel restrooms took its toll.

The wall by the shower and toilet is frosted glass. With the light on it is a pure silhouette show.

They lack customer centricity completely in all that they do. 1. I had a problem with an extra day’ charge for one of the two rooms we had booked here. Well I don’t have so much a problem with the charge as that can be passed off as their internal policy and lack of customer centricity but the way their front desk and the so called manager on duty handled it was absolutely unprofessional 2. Firstly, when they talk to each other when handling customers, they talk in some lousy stupid language of their own just so that their customers don’t understand. That’s totally unacceptable in a city like NY where people from all over the world are expected to turn up as guests and they can’t show such disrespect to their customers. 3. I did show my angst by saying I want to meet someone senior as the manager couldn’t take any decisions and kept referring to someone on the phone for trivial things. This so called manager then used seemingly abusive words in her own lousy language - well I don’t know what she said but definitely from her mannerism, it appeared to be abusive. Definitely unacceptable for one to do that to a customer. 4. We wanted some bags to be kept at the concierge for a while which they refused to and said there is a nearby agency which does this and shared some #. The least they should do if they can’t handle it at the hotel is to facilitate this for clients rather than just giving some # and asking us to handle all by ourselves. Complete lack of customer empathy. It’s like “stay here if you like else get the F out of here” - that’s the attitude these folks show to their customers. I have been staying in at least 8 properties all across the US the last few weeks on vacation with my family and we had a pleasant one at every single place except at the RIU PLAZA. A definite NO to any family stay - unless you want to meet some totally hostile creatures in their front desk and spoil the mood. They don’t even have a customer feedback process - I would have preferred to share this feedback first with some responsible guys back at the management of this hotel so that they can look at some corrective action rather than share this on a public forum but they don’t have any such system of taking feedback. The best you can get to is their front desk folks who are not trained enough to handle customer issues. I will wait to see if anyone responsible from their senior management will reach out to me to take some constructive feedback.","Chennai (Madras), India","cinujones</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chennai (Madras), India</strong>",2,1.0

Times Square and two different subway stations really close. Walgreens and loads of food places.Before we got to the hotel, we had requested for a room in a higher floor as the reviews here suggested so (lot of noise). They kindly responded that our request was considered and when we got to the hotel they had already arranged this - so, this bit was positive. Nice breakfast, also. Problem was that when the cleaners were on duty, they were talking really loud in the corridors, knocking on the doors nervously and fast, while obviously the doors' soundproofing wasn't able to hold off all this noise when you just want to rest and relax. Also, we got charged $30 for 5 local calls which is something we still try to resolve with them.","Athens, Greece","Dimimari</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Greece</strong>",5,3.0

The Hotel is in a perfect location, two minutes from Times Square. We chose this hotel because of its location and also because breakfast was offered as part of the package. Breakfast was buffet style, plenty of choice, and well organized. The staff worked hard to ensure tables were cleared quickly and everything topped up. No complaints whatsoever. This set us up for the busy day ahead and we did not bother about lunch, only a coffee and cake mid afternoon. The hotel also offered a Theatre Buffet in the evening costing $35 per person with a 10% discount if you were resident in the hotel. We decided to take advantage of this and are so glad we did, it was excellent with plenty of choice and the menu changed every night. Our room on the 8th floor was comfortable with king size bed, small fridge with bottled water which was replenished every 2nd day. The bathroom had a great shower with towels replaced every day and lovely toiletries provided. The only downside was the glass partition between bedroom and bathroom. When the light was turned on in the bathroom it lit up the whole room, not ideal for someone sleeping or for privacy in the bathroom. Also there was a sliding door with quite a large gap which again did not make for privacy. Staff throughout the hotel were helpful and polite and hardworking. This hotel was perfect for our requirements and we would definitely return.","Hamilton, United Kingdom","Z6398HSelizabethg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

We stayed on the 20th floor in a double room which was plenty for a weeks stay of long days out exploring. The room was small, however plenty for what you require on a city break. There was a safe and hairdryer in the room, brilliant as my UK one didn't work. Plenty of plugs and a mini fridge of which was empty but you could obviously fill with anything you required. We opted for bed and breakfast which was ideal as it set you up for the day. Despite breakfast being and seeming extremely busy, you were always quickly seated and food was plentiful. Varied selection, not masses but anyone could find something to eat in the mixture. Location wise: this hotel is brilliant!!! one block away from Times Square and hells kitchen. We found that we walked most places from here (if you're up for it) and equally it had good connections to the subway; uptown and downtown.Not much more to say other than it was perfect for a city break hotel. Our only suggestion which we put to the hotel was that it would have been great to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room. This was not available in our room and we would have welcomed this either first thing in the morning or when you get back at night.TIP: do not rely on the fact that you have the option to keep your room on. We had a late evening flight and was planning on keeping our room on. You have to go down to reception on the day of departure and ask. When we did so we were told there was no availability. As a result we left our bags with the concierge and used the gym showers to freshen up prior to leaving. On review, this was equally as good as paying extra to keep your room on.",,ordee1,27,4.0

Booked online via the British Airways website. Everything went perfectly apart from a contaminated water issue on the plane which resulted in no coffee or tea for 7 hours. also we were unable to purchase anything on the plane as there were no shopping magazines. Arrived a JFK but it took a further 3 hours to make it to the hotel due to security and waiting for transfers. When we arrived the doorman helped us with our baggage and the checkin process was smooth. You do have to leave a retainer for room tax, this can be done on a card or cash.We were on the top floor of one block..floor 28 and the room overlooked times square. Even tho we were on the top floor you could still here the endless traffic. Im glad we werent any lower. My friend and I had booked a king size deluxe room which was perfect for our needs. The rooms have everything you could want apart from tea and coffee facilities. If you like a hot drink when you get up then take a small kettle. There is a small coffee shop downstairs where you can purchase drinks and snacks from. The foyer is very modern and there is always people coming and going. The bar opens at 4pm with happy hour. Beware the cocktails they are potent......the strawberry mojito was my fave. This hotel provides breakfast and this was the main resason for choosing it. When you first visit it dont be put off by how busy it looks the staff are well trained in dealing with this. We never waited more than a few minutes to be seated and the choice is excellent. No its not 5star cuisine but it doesnt matter. It fills you up before you venture out to explore New York. The hotel is close to Times Square and most things are within walking distance but if you struggle a little bit then get a cab. Look for the illuminated lights on top of the cab this tells you if they are available or Uber is a big thing in NYC so get the app and uber away. They are cheaper and readily available. If want to book trips look outside for the guys and girls in the red jackets they are your sellers or your concierge in the hotel will be able to help you. Check out was painless but the return tranfser was horrendous. 2.5 hours and was nearly late. Be aware Fridays at 4pm is rush hour to the max.

I will never stay with this brand again. Although it has “Times Square” in its name, it’s not in Times Square. We had a room for three adults. The two queen beds were pushed together because they had to be. There was a sofa bed that when opened, caused you to be unable to open the refrigerator or sit at the desk. The bathroom was the worst. The door was a glass sliding barn door that had a two-three inch gap through which anyone could look in and see the commode. The wall was glass as well and so whoever was in the shower put on a shadow dance exhibit for anyone in the bedroom. Apparently a room nearby was being remodeled as it was quite noisy. I had to get new keys everyday because they quit working on the elevators and the room. I’ve stayed at Hampton Inns that we’re far better than this “luxury” hotel. I do not recommend it to anyone.

Whilst we did have to queue most mornings, it was a fast moving queue and the short wait was worth it. There was plenty of choice and the coffee in particular was very good.I would have given 5 stars, however, the service by the front desk and the concierge was very impersonal/uninterested (not what I have previously experienced when staying in New York) I guess this is because it is so large.

We found the staff rude , ignorant and to try and settle a tab would become hard work each night. We also found we purchased drinks one night then were told they were closing after buying drinks but we could not take glasses out of bar - so why did they serve us!!! Huge downside to hotel which I would say is the only thing the management need to review, they were so bad we stopped having our night cap their..

This is not it. I'm not sure who is rating this hotel in a positive way. Have they not stayed in nice hotels ?I wanted to qualify this review. I have an issue with the hotel itself. I have made a complaint with Riu about them charging me a premium rate of about $150 per night over the regular rate for a standard room. Head office referred me to the hotel. Just be very careful if you ever book a room.When checking out, I did watch a European couple get their reservation denied because the hotel had lost it. Some people have all the luck. The front desk staff. When I checked in with my kid they photocopied his passport. and mine. I don't even think that's legal. Also watched as one of them walked passed us sneakily taking a picture using his cell phone. Unbelievable. In spanish, Familia ??? Si Si .I immediately felt horrified in a gut wrenching kinda way. How could I have chosen such a horrible hotel. Do they normally charge by the hour ??? Who exactly are their regular clientele ???? I'm assuming ""working"" girls or worse. I felt sick. It's absolutely disgusting but all the other hotels were booked. Enough of that. The hotel itself, Aesthetically it's beautiful on the outside. It ends there.Things of note: 1: The rooms themselves require a key card to keep the power on. A quaint reminder of vacations to third world countries. 2: The floors in the rooms are ultra low cost floating plastic faux bleached wood. The kind that get spaces between them that you can close by slamming your shoe against them to snap them back together. 3: No pool4: You will love their breakfast. Not as high class as Ikea but close. At Ikea the staff smile and you can have individual tables. Very Stalin esqe in a CCCP group camp kinda way. 5: Location. I stayed with my kid. Which was really awkward when we walked out for a day in time square past the strip club next door. The hallways are about as wide as you would expect on a low budget cruise ship. Other than that. Its a hotel. So if all your looking for is a cot and a pillow, your good to go. Oh they do have a nice view. Alternatives. We ended up staying at the Hilton Time Square for the remainder of that trip. Another time my wife and I stayed at the Marriott Marquis.

Like others have mentioned, they should just include it in the advertised price. More of an annoyance being added on after, especially when it's only in the $13-$14 range. Breakfast was excellent, and service was spot on. We were on the 11th floor, so street noise was a nuisance, but not that you couldn't sleep. Wished there were ice machines, but having the mini fridge was a bonus. I didn't realize the bottles of water were complimentary until after I had purchased our own.

Check out is at 12 and they have a great bellboy service which was again much appreciated. Some parts of the room could be tidied up a bit - for example the power ports on the walls in my room were silver but all scratched off and showing white where the plug goes in. Also the metal had scratched off the plug hole in the sink and there was a large crack in the shower flooring. The rooms are cold and the air conditioning was around a corner in my room so i didnt notice it until a few nights in. There was however extra blankets in the wardrobe which was good.

Perfectly situated within a minutes walking distance to Times Square the location was a perfect base for visiting Broadway, The Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre, Macy’s etc. Central Park was in reasonable walking distances ok. The Hotel was extremely modern throughout and spotlessly clean; the bedrooms were cleaned to perfection. Our adapter had been left at home and the hotel reception were more than happy to supply a spare one they had. It was great to see that the hotel were making small adjustments to be more environmentally friendly; the soap and shower caps were wrapped in cardboard boxes and in the breakfast area reusable cups etc were provided. They also suggested leaving any towels on the floor that needed cleaning. Although this is a great step in the right direction I was surprised to see how throwaway New York is as a society and although they are actively recycling, there is so much waste created it would be difficult to cope with the amount produced. The hotel kindly provided fresh bottles of water every other day, which although great it would be better if they had provided refillable large glasses which the staff refilled. The Cafe connected to the hotel did great hot drinks; but again drinks were in throw away containers even for those drinking in. Moreover in the breakfast area the napkins and table cloths were all throw away and it would have been great to see reusable options. The sauces were on display but you could choose small containers; again throwaway. Despite this we had a great stay and I had a great 30th birthday. This hotel was so great that despite the environmental concerns we couldn’t give it less than 5 *s. But I hope this review will make the the hotel consider these small changes which I think will set the standards for other hotels to follow.",,Agirlcalleddave,0,5.0

We went to the sights we thought would be busiest first thing in the morning, didn’t queue for a single one. Including Empire State Building. The hotel itself is so underrated. Perfect views (we stayed on floor 24) the hotel is very clean and decorated lovely. The breakfast buffet went down a treat! Everything you could want and more.

We arrived at about midnight due to huge queues at customs in the airport and road closures and long traffic delays from the airport. By this point we were absolutely exhausted and just wanted to go to bed! The staff upon check in were so welcoming and friendly and made the check in process so quick and easy - just what we needed after a long journey! We emailed prior to our stay requesting a high up room and on check in we were allocated a room on the 3rd floor. I explained that I had requested a room on a high floor and they changed it straight away for a room on 20th floor. The room itself was modern and clean. It was a little on the small size but perfectly adequate for 2 adults, especially as we were out all day and only came back to sleep! The room had a very comfortable king size bed, a small desk and chair, two bedside tables with drawers, a free standing mini fridge with bottle water in every other day, a good sized wardrobe with plenty of hangers, a safe, an iron and ironing board.The curtains blocked out all of the light which was great as there are lots of flashing signs and billboards around. There are also plugs either side of the bed which is great for charging phones. One side had USB ports in the wall and the other side had normal sockets. There was also a huge TV on the wall at the end of the bed. The bathroom was spacious with a lovely big walk in shower - the bathroom also had a hairdryer.There is a glass wall between the shower and bedroom so you can see the outline of someone in the shower but this didn’t both us as we are married. If you are travelling with friends you may find this awkward. The door to the bathroom was sliding and had a huge gap so you could actually see if someone was on the toilet, but again didn’t really bother us. The room came with a free breakfast. I was concerned about breakfast as I have read a lot of negative reviews but I shouldn’t have been concerned. We ate at different times each day and never did we have any problems. There were staff by the doors to breakfast who would direct you to a free table. We only ever had to wait around 2 minutes and this was due to a large family being there first and they were trying to find a table for them to all sit together, otherwise it was so efficient considering how many people were at breakfast. They also have food on two sides so there aren’t queues waiting for food.The breakfast itself was great and I was very surprised. Usually free hotel breakfasts are mediocre but this was really good. They have everything you could want; cereal, toast, rolls, cold meats, cheese, sausages, sausage patties, eggs, bacon, beans, pancakes, waffles, croissants, pastries, yoghurt, fruit etc.. And there were coffee machines and juice machines so you can help yourself. Really couldn’t fault breakfast.We also used the hotel bar called Fashion Bar which is right off the hotel lobby. During the week they had all day happy hour specials, which meant $8 cocktails! One day we were in there and I ended up having 4 cocktails. When we got the bill 2 of them were charged at $8 each and the other 2 were charged at $9 each. We queried it and the staff apologised and went to check, when they came back they said they have taken the 2 that we $9 each off the bill for their error which was really good of them.The staff were all really friendly and helpful.The location of the hotel was also fantastic. You are literally a few minutes walk to Times Square and max. 15 minute walk to other attractions like Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre, Central Park etc. There are also plenty of subway stations close by and many restaurants and bars so you will have plenty of choice for dinner.Would highly recommend this hotel and will stay again!",,Heidi R,3,5.0

She left me speaking to myself... I went and decided to come for breakfast at a later time (I read some reviews that if you arrive later for breakfast, it is not that busy). I came back around 10:00 am to a different restaurant next to the elevators and had the same horrible experience, the hostess told me to sit on a table that was dirty and everything looked a mess! Then the cherry on top of the cake: I had a very important business call at 11:00 am, I was looking forward to having this call for a week!! I went to my room and placed the Do not disturb sign outside of the door... Two things happen: After one minute of being on the phone the fire alarm went on!! It was a drill, as per the announcement over the PA system, the drill was for the Fire Department of NY state, however, this is something that they could have told the guest: advise them at Check-in, leave a voicemail or a note so people are aware!!! This totally ruined the call that I've been waiting for months!!! Finally, the fire alarm went off and I could continue with my call (very embarrassed with a very important client).... and on top of that, the housekeeping knocked on the door!!!!!! OMG! Check-out is at 12 pm, it was 11:10 am, and I placed the do not disturb sign outside of the door.

Bathroom is nice but has a frosted glass to the bedroom which if someone showers and are right up against the glass isn't the greatest for privacy . One WARNING be careful of the bell hops. We enquired how much a cab would be to JFK. The bell hop pushed us to get a car organised by him as it would be cheaper. We were quoted $75 and informed this included all tips, tolls etc. We clarified this by asking did this include the tip for driver and we were told yes. I noted that the receipt I was given said ""gratuities not included"". I went back again to check and he insisted that it did. His actual words were ""trust me"". I was totally embarrassed when I got to JFK. I handed over the money. The driver counted it and said ""I guess you were not happy with the service today"". I explained what I was told but could tell that he was not happy. He was very diplomatic but none the less I felt embarrassed. This kind of soured an otherwise really nice vacation in the big Apple .By the way yellow cabs offer a flat rate of around 65 dollars to JFK plus tip so if I was you that's the way I would go do not trust what the hotel bell hops tell you .","Twickenham, United Kingdom","Dave p K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Twickenham, United Kingdom</strong>",20,4.0

Please note that the street is under construction across from the entrance and it's a one way. Therefore, if you need an Uber or taxi, it will take them longer to arrive! Plan accordingly. The lobby was bright, clean, had plenty of seating and was well updated. We walked over to the counter and a super nice woman checked us in early. She did tell us about the deposit that they hold and that was ok. Make sure it's enough though as you will need it to cover any incidentals such as the bar, etc. We received our keys and went up to our room, 2105. The elevator requires your room key to insert then choose your floor each time you go up. Very nice security feature. Once we arrived on our floor we stepped off the elevator into a very warm lobby, super warm. It was very cold outside but this warm was a bit much. Upon entering our two bed, sleeper sofa room, we noticed it was warm too. The decor was very nice, clean and ample room for the four of us. I did read on other reviews that the bathroom had an opening in the sliding door that allowed guests to see each other on the loo. They were right! I could sit down on the toilet and actually watch TV! LOL I included pics of the crack. Also, the main shower wall is frosted glass and the other guests can see the shadow outline of whoever is showering and what they are washing. If the showerer pressed their buns against the glass, you could see it as if you were right there.The room faced other buildings but also if you looked to the right, you could see the street and the fire station below. (*If you don't want to hear the sirens all night, bring ear plugs, 21 floors up and we could hear them great) The room was bright, cheerful and clean. We did have an issue with the AC not cooling. Even though outside was cold, the temp in our room was at 78 and rising. Too warm to catch a nap. We lowered it to 65 and still it climbed. We contacted the front desk and a maintenance man arrived quickly. He fixed it and it was great the rest of the trip. (*we do think like others did, that the air temp is controlled by the hotel as the warmer the outside city got, the cooler the room did) We noted that the special gift I requested did arrive after 4 pm which is when the bar opens. The bathroom is equipped with a blow dryer, a good one too, soap, conditioner, body lotion and in the shower is a shampoo/body wash combo bottle mounted to the wall. They give nice linens except during our stay, we had 4 ppl, they only kept giving us 2 washcloths. I called each day to get extras. The pillows on the bed were small and there is 1 extra large one in the closet on the upper shelf. I called and received extras with no problem.There is an iron, ironing board, safe with your own code, hangers, a luggage rack and two hooks on the wall. There are two nightstands with drawers. The beds are high enough to hide your suitcases under. The beds are very,very comfortable. I've had spinal surgery recently and was worried but I slept like a baby. The only odd thing is that the beds were pushed together. Housekeeping is clean and helpful. We did have an issue with our mini fridge. It's mounted on a tri wheel base and we put a bottle of vodka, bottle of champagne, two glasses and some plastic cups on the top. Out of nowhere, it tipped over towards the window and crashed the vodka bottle to the ground, breaking the glasses and the bottle. I called down and housekeeping came right up as did maint. They cleaned it up and while maint was there, he saw how it tipped yet again right in front of him. I was concerned as I had my child there but he fixed it with some blocks. Just make a note that this can happen. They even replaced my vodka with a bottle from the bar! At breakfast, Diana greeted us and since we had the extra person in our room added at the last minute, her list didn't show it. She checked with the front desk and voila! We were let right in. She is very capable in her position and speedy. The food was delicious. They offer much more at a free breakfast than any hotel I've been. The staff is so helpful and smiling. They also have a business center that you can print your boarding passes. Most hotels always have issues with their printers but not the RIU. I called down one morning and on the other end was a gentleman who sounded like he was laughing/smiling over the phone. I told him he sounded like he was having a great day and he agreed while chuckling. I can tell a place is a good employer if the employees are smiling and laughing. They were. Patricia at the concierge desk is also very friendly and will try to find you shows. I have to say, the little inconveniences were nothing compared to the value, the location, the staff and the amenities. I would stay again and I would recommend you do too.

Had a fantastic (but very tiring) holiday in the big apple.We always use Riu hotels whenever we go on holiday, hence our status as Riu Class Gold members and always email the hotel before we travel asking for a free room upgrade. On this occasion we were given a room on the ""crown level"" 26th floor and had a great room with stunning views. The rooms are smaller than you get in normal Riu resorts as you would expect of a city centre hotel, but the room was lovely. The only thing I was surprised about was there aren't coffee making facilities in the room. However, this didn't matter to us because we had the use of an executive lounge which is reserved for 26th floor guests and has a coffee machine, soft drinks, wine and snacks available 24 hours.As for the Big Apple, it was 20 years since our last visit and we did all the usual touristy things: Brooklyn Bridge, MSG, Greenwich Village, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Statten Island Ferry, Statue of liberty and of course Times Square. The hotel location is perfect, just off the square so not too noisy, but within easy walking distance of subway stations etc.The highlight of our visit was definitely the 9/11 memorial and museum. It is obviously very sad and sombre but fascinating none the less. I would highly recommend the guided tour of the museum which lasts an hour and costs $20. I think our tour guide was called Becky, and she was excellent. If you book any attractions before you go it is cheaper - NY is very expensive, as are all major cities.We spent 4 hours in the museum and could have spent longer, but felt we had been depressed enough by then! Its strange to ""enjoy"" such a sad tribute, but its presented so well and with such respect it really is a ""must do"" whilst you're there.My best advice for a trip to the big apple: take comfortable walking shoes!

Well worth a trip.I did not give a 5 star - but ONLY because there was no coffee making facilities in the room (I really need coffee first thing in the morning!) and the bar prices were somewhat extortionate... but again, it's New York - so what do you expect :-)While on here I'd recommend Carmines for an unreal dining experience - just superb, Westway Diner for it's great menu and friendliest service and Panda Express for a low cost but REALLY tasty Chinese meal.Would I go back to this hotel - definitely.

When we went back the next morning at 9am we were pushed out by a horrible staff member called Maria. No apology, just told to get out and go to the other reataurant.Our room was not cleaned at all while we were there. Even after asking reception in person to look into it. AND calling down to reception again.Luckily they brought us clean towels one day.If you like service with a smile, then don't stay at this hotel. Very disappointing.

Brilliant location if you are a tourist and it’s your first time in New York. Hotel is spotless. There is a lovely smell in the lobby area, wish I had asked what it was and where I could get some for home! We stayed at the Riu for a week and were in a deluxe king. The room was more than big enough for us. There is a good sized wardrobe with about 8-10 hangers. The rain shower is heaven. As many people have commented on before, the only thing the room is missing is a tea/coffee making facilities. And in a 4* hotel, I think it should be there. Breakfast was included and really set us up for the day. The restaurant staff were my favourite... always cheerful and welcoming. Two places serve breakfast... the main restaurant and also the Fashion bar. The main restaurant is much much bigger than the fashion bar, but I liked the the fashion bar much more for breakfast because it was smaller. It’s only open until 9.30am whereas the main restaurant serves breakfast until 11am. If you are an early riser, go to the Fashion Bar. There is a Duane Reade ‘pharmacy’ (but actually a supermarket as well), about 50m from the hotel. The street next to the hotel is known as ‘restaurant row’. Many places to eat there if you are all walked out. One of the USB plugs in our bedroom did not work when we arrived so when we were heading out for the day, I let reception know and also asked for an extra pillow. When we got back that day, the plug had been fixed and our room had been made up with an extra pillow included.Attentive staff and a great, spotless, centrally located hotel with a great vibe. What more could you want? We booked with British Airways and got such a reasonable deal. Having breakfast at the hotel saves so much on food.

The location is brilliant, just behind Times Square. This means you don't feel/hear the noise, but you profit from being in the very centre of Manhattan. It is a big and pretty new hotel, everything was nice and clean. We were on the 23rd floor and had a brilliant view from the room, overlooking all neighbor buildings. Metrostation is nearby, restaurants and shops are too. The breakfast in the hotel is amazing. They serve all guests in a big restaurant (ok, this is not very cosy), but the meal is great and the waiting line is limited. We never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be seated. The room is not too spacious for 4 people (2 queen beds) but very much ok for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. Yes, I missed a coffee machine, but that's about it. There are 6 elevators and sometimes you had to wait to get up/down, although the elevator could take different (unnecessary) stops when it was fully occupied already which was a bit annoying... An engineer should take a look at this... So if you think location and great breakfast is important, you should definitely book this hotel when staying in Manhattan. If you are more on the look-out for a boutique hotel, you should look somewhere else.

One thing worth noting is that they do place upon checking in a $100 hold on your credit card - upon checking out about $52 is taken from this for ‘resort fees’. It wasn’t explained what ‘resort fees’ cover - but I’m presuming it must be things like WiFi, gym etcThe rooms are small - but I don’t think you can expect any different considering the location. Spotlessly clean. They were cleaned on a daily basis, towels changed when requested & bottled water restocked every other day. There’s also a fridge available & tons of complimentary toiletries.There’s just a few things which for me stop this hotel from being a 5. The lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. I don’t understand this considering that this is not a cheap hotel The two other things which I wasn’t keen on was the frosted glass window that separates the shower from the main bedroom - fine if your travelling as a couple, but not exactly private when travelling with children I also wasn’t keen on the breakfast - I fully appreciate that this is free & that the hotel isn’t able to control other guests - but it was to crammed in & too busy.

The hotel was in a fantastic location, only one block from times square which made it really easy to walk everywhere.

Unfortunately, the restaurant where breakfast is served is far too small to deal with a full hotel. Its basically set up like a school canteen, with tables and guests on top of each other.

On day two, we noticed that the hotel had actually taken this payment twice. We immediately went to reception to address this. The reception is set up with 2 desks, one for checking in and the other for customer service, with the opening hours displayed as 9am – 5pm, I believe. This was approx. 2PM. We went to the customer service desk and waited for several minutes. It was completely unattended. This was despite multiple staff members at the check in desk looking over toward us whilst not actually doing anything, but selectively ignoring our presence. Eventually, we had to queue up at the check in line, just to ask a question! When we finally got this addressed, the receptionist could not have been more rude. We were bluntly told “that’s not possible” when we said we were charged twice. The lady did not actually check anything, she just answered us instantly. We showed her our online banking, clearly showing 2 transactions. Again, she said no way, we don’t take 2 payments its an issue with your bank. Whilst very unhappy about it, we had no choice but to further address it with our bank to confirm what was going on.On our last day we requested a late check out which we received. We were advised to come down to reception on the morning of check out and have our room key re-cut to ensure we don’t get locked out. We did this, as requested and happened to have the same receptionist we dealt with previously assisting us again. I do not recall her name but she was an older member of the team with a tattoo below her ear, down her neck. Upon beginning to say why we were at reception (to cut the key), she turned to another staff member and spoke in Spanish, then laughed. This alone was extremely rude and unprofessional. I again explained that we had called about a late check out and we were told to come down for the key to be cut. Before I finished, she cut me off stating “its too late for a late check out now.” I sternly said excuse, me, had you let me finish you would know that this was already addressed hours ago with a colleague of yours. We have the late check out confirmed and we were told to come down for our key to be cut”. She then replied “well you didn’t say that, there’s no need for a bad attitude.” She looked at our key then said “that’s fine”, so we assumed we were good. Hours later upon trying to enter our room, we were locked out! She had not cut the key to stop this happening.This woman is beyond disgraceful! She has single handedly ensured that 2 people will absolutely never consider staying in this hotel again, along with telling others to avoid it.Upon arriving home we checked with our bank about the payment issue. They confirmed that we were 100% charged twice. 1 Transaction was held on the card (as expected) but the other transaction had actually been completed by the hotel several hours later. The hotel knew this, as we could see that a few days afterwards they had refunded it. We are in a Euro country so our currency is Euro. Due to exchange rates, the refund was €10 less than what they actually took fraudulently. We contacted Riu hotels and Riu Times Square directly to address this. They advised that a refund was processed but ignored our protests about us being €10 out of pocket due to their own error. Eventually, our bank had to step in and got this back for us.It really is such a shame because there are a small number of staff members in the hotel who are way too good to be working there. The bellboy, for example. Complete gentleman! His colleagues completely let them down as a whole though.Having visited New York 7 times between the 2 of us, I can absolutely assure you that there are dozens of hotels at similar prices to this one, providing significantly better service to you in the exact same area. I cannot recommend the hotel for any visit.","Dublin, Ireland","DavidKIreland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",33,1.0

We had a fabulous room on the 23rd floor with city views. The room was good, with very comfortable, clean bed and good quality shower. The cleaning was top notch every day. Yes, I can imagine it would be noisy on lower floors, but we brought ear plugs just in case, but, if you're travelling to a big city, then you can't expect peace and quiet. The breakfast was fantastic, with a choice for every taste. We ate like kings each morning. I loved the fruit (which actually tasted of fruit, as compared with some of the tasteless choices available back in the supermarkets at home). There was something for everyone. Yes, sometimes we had to wait 5 minutes for a table, but that really wasn't a problem at all and it could get busy, but no more so than anywhere else we've stayed. The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Pointers to make a great hotel a fantastic one:-1. Tea making facilities in room (an absolute must).2. Mirror above dressing table.3. Two chairs, not the one we were originally given (we liked to sit and watch the world go by from the window).Very close to Times Square, and centrally situated for all the sightseeing attractions. Closeby to subway too. Had a wonderful stay. Would come back here in a flash. There are a couple of Whole Foods Market stores within a 10/15 minute walk of the hotel. Great shop, stocking absolutely everything. Hot and cold food of all varieties which can be selected (from a buffet type of arrangement), and either eaten in store or taken back to the hotel (which we did a couple of times). Good way to save money, as restaurants are expensive. Don't hesitate to book this hotel.

The hotel was ok, nothing particularly special - what you would expect from this style of hotel, from a hotel chain. The thing I want to point out is how disappointed I was in the way they cater for guests with food allergies. It really was not ok.I suffer with celiac disease, which means I have to keep gluten out of my diet. If I eat gluten by mistake, it is not like a nut allergy (which can be deadly), but I can be sick for days, sometimes even weeks. Before my trip I checked with the hotel and was told “all RIU hotels offer a range of glutenfree food”. This really was not the truth. At check-in I was told to talk to the servers at breakfast and the people in the restaurants and they would be able to help. The reality was that during the whole trip, I was only offered a couple of pieces of toast and as far as allergies being shown on menus or on the breakfast buffet, there was absolutely no information. It was let to the guest to decide what they could or could not eat, a complete lottery. You took your chance and then saw how your body reacted; good or bad. This was a chance I was not prepared to take, so I had to bring my own food to breakfast and never ate in the restaurant. For people with nut or seafood allergies, this really could be a life or death decision of what to eat.I really expected more from RIU and their hotel in New York. A minimum should be that allergy information is provided. In fact, in most countries – especially in Europe – I am sure this is needed by law. Also there should be some option for people with allergies or wish to eat say a vegan diet. It should not be left to the guest to decide and then without information, you just take a chance. RIU have a duty to their guest, if not through law, but to provide them with information during their stay. It really is not much to ask to give people these warnings and alternatives.From what I saw at the RIU Plaza Times Square Hotel means that I will not use the RIU hotels again, until I can be sure there is food I can eat, or at minimum information that allows me to safeguard my health. Anyone else who has food allergies I would urge you to check, double check and even ask for exact details of what RIU can offer. Don’t be like me, just accept their word, and then arrive and be disappointed, even go hungry because they cannot provide for their guests","Vienna, Austria","Corin H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",2,3.0

That said there is a good selection and even the fussiest of eaters will find something. The waiting staff are really nice special mention to Cecil always cheerful. A couple of the ladies that check you in for breakfast were a little rude. The fashion bar, is a great place to have a relaxing drink after a day of sightseeing, I highly recommend the Fashion punch.

However when my husband asked the Bar tender for 2 champagne glasses to take to the room he was told he wasn’t allowed to but we could have plastic ones.

All NYC hotel rooms are small, this was but it was plenty big enough for our stay. It was very warm. Breakfast was included, a rarity in the USA, standard buffet style and chaotic due to large amounts of people all up early to get fed and out to see the sites. Ours was a 5 night stay and we liked the hotel for its convenience in “doing the tourist attractions “ it is one block away from Times Square and subway stations are nearby, we used them a lot, or taxis ( pricey) The only downside was the lovely Executive lounge was occasionally exploited by loud over zealous guests ( group of loud young women) who deemed it their role to completely eat and drink all that was provided and leave it in a mess rather than consider other guests! This is no fault of the hotel who every day cleaned it up and replenished the fridges etc.Just bear in mind NYC is very expensive, most meals for two in local area between $80-90, bottle of beer $10-15.If you’re prepared to go further afield to Chinatown or Little Italy meals are better and a bit cheaper.

We had breakfast included and it was great, plenty of choice and the food was lovely. All the staff at the hotel seemed really friendly and happy to help with anything you need. When we left we needed a taxi to the airport, the hotel have their own drivers who will take you there for a flat rate of $75 which I thought was acceptable, same price if not cheaper than a yellow cab and much more comfortable!Thanks Riu for a great stay!

It was exceptionally disappointing that i asked to borrow a common power cable to power up my equipment equipment, instead i was referred to Best Buy, this was 11pm in the evening.

The hotel does not have room service, so be sure to stock up on snacks. The rooms are tiny, but this is what you can expect from any hotel in NYC, bedding could do with a refresh, it felt old and tired.

We stayed for 5 nights, starting 20th January 2019 and made our booking through British Airways as part of a package holiday.Approximately 10 days prior to arrival at the hotel I contacted the front of house department by email to see if it was possible to stay in a room on a high floor with a view, as we wanted to make it special for our mother who was celebrating her 60th birthday during our stay. I received a reply the same day saying they would endeavour to meet our requests and would make our stay as memorable as possible.Upon arrival we found check-in to be straightforward and efficient. Our booking was found on the system without any problems and the staff went through the hotel general information and services they had to offer, along with the total fees payable at the end of the stay.We stayed in a Deluxe Twin room which consisted of two double beds on the 22nd floor which had great views out of the window (as we kindly requested). The room was spacious, had a modern decor and was clean throughout. The beds were comfortable and never had any trouble sleeping.Breakfast was included with our package which we enjoyed each morning. Getting seated in one of the breakfast rooms was a swift process and there were plenty of staff on hand making sure everything went smoothly. There was a large selection of breakfast items to choose from and when each item was running low members of staff were quick to replenish them.Maid service was carried out each day to a high standard, with bottled water and toiletries being restocked when they were low. We also found the beds made up upon returning to our room after spending the day out.During breakfast on the morning of our mother's birthday members of staff presented her with a hot chocolate brownie with a message reading 'Happy Birthday'. The hotel maids also left a little box of chocolates and a birthday message inside the room. She was pleased and grateful for this and we thought it was a nice touch.Checking out was as efficient as checking in. After having the room deposit returned and paying the hotel resort fees ($13.07 + tax per room per night), we used the luggage storage facility via the bellboy as we had a late flight and did not want to carry our luggage around with us all day. We returned later in the day with our luggage tickets to retrieve our suitcases, tipped the bellboy and made our way back to the airport to head back home.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Riu Plaza in New York Times Square. The location is ideal and close to many attractions. For those out of walking distance the nearest Subway station is only a few minutes walk away. Staff were friendly, the room more than suited our needs and we look forward to staying again in the future.Many thanks!","London, United Kingdom","Laura W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

I love my fruit of a morning and was happy to find fresh Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, pineapple, bananas etc. My partner had the cooked breakfast which he enjoyed, and on my last morning we had smoked Salmon and scrambled eggs. I like my coffee on the milky side so just added a little hot milk which was available. We were always seated quickly- even on the busiest mornings and the breakfast items were replenished quickly. Staff in the breakfast room were polite and attentive at all times.Be aware that there is a tax to pay when you leave - I think ours was $54 for four nights. We were advised of this upon our arrival by a very quick talking receptionist- she asked for our paperwork and credit card a number of times - we just stared at her until we understood, we were not being ignorant- we just couldn’t understand her accent. The hotel is central to lots of tourist sites. The lobby area is inviting- we didn’t have a drink in the bar so can’t comment- but it never seemed busy. We found a bar called Jimmys Corner a short walk away where the drinks averaged about $3 for a draught larger. It was an unpretentious small bar but the drinks were good with some nice company. I can also recommend the Brazen Tavern, the drinks here a a similar price to most of the Irish bars in the area $7 a pint, but this place was a lot more elegant and cosy than the cold plastic Irish bars, there was a cosy lit fire, lots of candles giving off a warm atmosphere- and the young lady serving made you feel nothing was too much trouble for her. It’s on 44th street, give it a go.

We used the subway a lot so it was easy getting to and from the hotel for sightseeing.We were given a room on the 29th floor so had a reasonable view but facing the wrong direction to see any buildings of interest. The rooms are very small so we had to put our suitcases on the bed each morning as there was no room to open them on the floor. The rooms are clean and comfortable. As others have mentioned the frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room means that the bathroom light lights up the entire room if anyone uses the bathroom at night.Breakfast was a bit disappointing. Although it was not that busy before 8am and we did not have to wait for a seat the selection of food was limited and often had been sitting out for some time. The pancakes were dried out and had crusts around the edges and the coffee machines seemed to break down regularly.

We waited in line for nearly half an hour before a desk receptionist was able to see us. The kind woman was helpful in collecting our information and getting us checked in. She then directed me to the valet service to park my car. The valet attendant quickly took my keys and “parked my car.” My family and I then went to our rooms and inspected for any prior damage so as to bring Any existing damage to the hotels attention before we settled in. I am glad we did- as one of our rooms was an absolute disgrace to the reputation of the hotel. As you will see in the photos that I have attached to this email, there were stains in the sheets, another guests hair in the sheets, and holes speckled the bed sheet. We tried calling the desk to inform somebody and the person on the line told me that they couldn’t help me and instructed me to find somebody in reception. Well, shockingly, I assumed the number I called WAS reception. Nonetheless, I went downstairs again to inform somebody. Nobody was available at the desk. Instead, we found another sleeping arrangement for our party that was occupying two separate rooms- each containing two beds. We made it work. After we fixed our arrangement, I walked downstairs to head out for an evening in the city. I found my car running on the side of the road. I recognized it right away by the license plate number. A black Audi Q5... I quickly ran BACK into the hotel desk and demanded to speak with somebody. The valet attendant scolded me and told me that they have been “waiting on me for HOURS to pick up my vehicle!” I meekly and embarrassingly stated that I had “dropped the vehicle off for valet and I am not leaving until tomorrow.” I pulled out my valet ticket and as he looked, he rolled his eyes and picked up his phone to contact a driver. He assured me the vehicle would be taken care of properly. I then carried on with my night.Upon check out the next morning, I tried to explain my families experience to the service desk. The woman behind the desk frantically began “searching our information” in the computer. I simply stated to her that I would handle the situation myself and contact the appropriate people (as I am doing in this email). We then moved to the valet area and requested that we have our car returned. We waited well over 45 minutes for the return of the vehicle. During the interim period, we were sitting in an area by the door with our luggage- eagerly, yet patiently. Suddenly a man appearing to be of some authority(manager maybe?) approached us and boldly told us to “stand up and move from the seating area.” Adversely, we stood, collected our belongings, and stood outside while we waited for the car to be returned. The valet driver returned with our car and would not allow us to put our belongings in the vehicle. Instead, I was faced with a communication barrier that made me feel as though my own vehicle was being held hostage from me.I have to say- I have traveled many, many places and stayed in NYC many times. I have never experienced such terrible customer service. There was quite literally ONE person that was delightful to speak with. I wish I could remember her name. The rest of our experience was simply awful. The bed was dirty, the attendants throughout the hotel made me feel as if my family was a burden. We did not feel welcome at all. I truly do no wish to return to this location and I will not encourage anybody to stay there.",,Daniel C,1,2.0

It is clean and tidy, and has good breakfast. But a piece of advice- you rather want to check in early than later. Arrived in NY at midnight, no one helped with the luggages. Two guys saw me struggling with multiple bags and none of them offered to help; instead they watched me drop my stuff at least three times until I had to ask for help in which the guy answered saying that the conceige reopens at 8am and theres nothing that he could do to help. So, with my luaggage, I managed to reach the check in desk where I struggled again to check into the room and was left helplessly at the hotel lobby for 30 minutes. One amazing staff, I think his name is ‘Amandro’, however, intervened and proceeded with the check in which literally took less than five minutes and helped with the conceige (i thought it reopened at eight am but apparently not and mind you, it was the very same guy who told me conceige was closed) Overall, it is a decent hotel but Staying at this hotel twice at different times I have received mixed service.

You must take a trip to woodbury common outlet shopping centre it is an hour away from Manhattan and you can buy tickets for 42 dollars return from Port Authority bus station or from the sight seeing ticket operators which are on every street near Times Square you will also receive a voucher book on arrival to use whilst shopping. If you get time have a travel on the subway to the Yankee stadium in the Bronx it is great any single journey on the subway is only $3 but be aware of all the buskers and singers and people asking you for money on the subway there are alot but after a while you get used to them.Macy's is amazing got some great bargains and very cheap in there for clothes and bags etc but only if they are in the sale.All in all an excellent trip and New York and everyone there is amazing it is such a happy place and I made some very special memories there, and I would most def stay at this hotel again they provide a wonderful luxury place to stay in.

I boarded the Airtrain to Jamaica station ($5), then took the E subway to 50th Street ($2.75 single trip) and walked the four blocks (5mins) to the hotel. I purchased a week's unlimited pass at $32 as this was more cost effective for my stay in NYC. Please beware... do not purchase your Metrocard from the vendors at the kiosk, use the machines instead. They are nothing but hustlers and will rip you off in tips. They claim to save you the extra dollar charged for a new metrocard, but charge you more in supposed tips. I was given $3 less (with no explanation) after I'd purchased my cards and when challenged, was told it was taken as tips. Tips? For a one second transaction? Jokers... they prey on your naiveté.On arrival at the hotel, I walked into a very clean and welcoming lobby and I didn't wait too long to be seen by the front desk.The first room I checked into on the 16th floor was unsuitable as it was too bright. I was then moved to a room with a balcony and really nice view on the 25th floor, but this was also tricky; gaps in the balcony door caused on-going eerie whistling as it was quite windy.Back down I went. I explained the situation to the receptionist who quickly found me yet another room on the 21st floor, which was absolutely perfect.  I must commend the receptionist, Moyur Ahmed (real asset to the company) as he dealt with me with genuine care throughout my stay at RIU Plaza. Nothing was ever too much trouble for staff at RIU Plaza, as I later found out.The room was extremely clean, comfortable and warm, with easy to read temperature control. The bathroom was of a good size and the shower was effective and powerful. Complimentary toiletries and mineral water were replenished daily.Six unbelievably fast elevators service all 28 floors, which was great as I was so high up.Breakfast was always very busy, but queue times well managed. The food was always fresh, tasty and constantly replenished. I didn't like the Minute Maid apple and orange juice from the dispenser though... tasted like it was laden with artificial ingredients.I didn't have dinner at the hotel, so I am unable to comment on the food or service. I ate out everynight as there are so many lovely restaurants in the area. Check out OBAO Thai/Vietnamese between 45th and 46th Street... the Catfish claypot is absolutely amazing. I also didn't use the gym, but I did see that it was well equipped.After checking out, I actually sought out the duty manager to thank her in person, as I was really impressed with my stay at the hotel.

It was early December and the location suited us for visiting all the main attractions. Check in was concerning as we were advised that if you’re not at breakfast for 6am it might be difficult (and then the receptionist cackled and said “you’ll see why!!”). I’m not a morning person but I got up at 6am for the first few days and we just managed to get a seat at breakfast. The latter few days we just gave up and went to a diner, which defeats the object of paying for breakfast. The queues into the dining room actually blocked access to the lifts in the morning so this side of things was a little chaotic and poorly thought out. The room was actually ok for NYC. Cleanish (some hairs in the bed) and water was meant to be restocked every other day but never was during our week despite mentioning it to reception several times. If you’re not travelling with your partner then please don’t shower with the bathroom light on as it’s quite a show you put on through the glass wall into the bedroom. Mildly embarrassing even with my partner. General feeling that staff really weren’t interested at all. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and I asked the concierge for any recommendations for places that stand out nearby. The response was “if the restaurant is near here it will be good”. So no recommendations? I asked? “No, just choose one you like the look of”. Not exactly helpful. We were on the 28th floor, an upgrade if you book direct with a Riu was promised but that didn’t materialise. Even that high up there was plenty of noise from traffic and sirens (it’s to be expected in midtown) and after the first few nights I got used to it and slept. Would I stay here again? Probably not.

Firstly it is an ideal position for exploring New York, two minutes walk from the centre of Times Square. The hotel is very modern and looked lovely with all the Christmas decorations, the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean with very modern decoration, the bathroom was huge for a city centre hotel with big walk in shower, everything was provided hairdryer, fridge, ironing board and iron and free, yes free safety deposit box and a full size TV on the wall. The lifts are a little temperamental and get very busy at breakfast time, it was so bad one day we actually found it quicker to walk 17 floors down to the ground floor. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis, it is a buffet service and the food was very good and lots of choice, the restaurant was perfectly positioned by the sidewalk so you can watch the world go by whilst enjoying your breakfast. Again the restaurant gets very busy at certain times and the food is not particularly set out very well so it is chaos at times, it was not helped that the pastries are above the hot food which if you are short is actually difficult to reach but also you then have to get in the huge queue for hot food to just grab a croissant, or if you push in face the wrath of the people in the queue. We also went into the bar a couple of times, again this is very nice and comfortable.

So they told me: « We have to cancel the reservation you did, because you don’t have the old credit card with you. » So, they told me I need to pay our stay...a second time.(They say, they will refund me in 6-7 business days) Really????

Her answer was: « NO! »I said why???

We stopped by twice and it was alright, a bit average and very crowded but a good way to start your day in nyc.It’s a nice stay for location but I think when we return we might try to find another hotel as it was an average price for New York standards.

From the minute we got there (the man who took our bags for us was amazing, made us feel very welcome and definately knows how to put a smile on people's faces) check in was quick and easy, we were on the 18th floor and had an amazing view and hardly any noise. The room was outstandingly clean and modern, bed was comfortable and a mini fridge in one if the cupboards which had water in, this was meant to be topped up every other day, however I found sometimes it was missed. It was a nice touch but could of been better if stocked up regularly. There also wasn't any coffee making facilities in the room, not too much of a problem for us but might be for some people. These are the only had things I can say about this hotel really. Check out was quick and the hotel will hold your bags for the day if your flight isn't until later which came in handy. This hotel is very close to times square, just round the corner which I preferred as it was nice to get away from the noisy and busy times square. I read the reviews on TripAdvisor before I picked this hotel and was very glad I chose this hotel, with regards to people saying they can see through the frosted glass into the bathroom, I was with my partner so didn't matter too much but we tested this while we were there. The shower was situated on this wall and you couldn't see hardly anything through the glass when looking from the room, unless you stood very close or touched the glass. The toilet was at the other end of the bathroom so couldn't see partner when sat on the toilet through the glass. It didn't bother me much but thought I'd mention in case people were worried about it. All in all brilliant hotel and would recommend to anyone.

Great location and a friendly check in team that did all they could to allocate rooms for our party as close to each other as possible. Moyer deserves particular praise for his friendliness and professionalism at check in, throughout our stay and at check out. The hotel is v. close to Times Square and well placed for all the restaurants and bars of Hells Kitchen.The standard room is very small, but fairly modern and clean but there’s nowhere to place large cases. There’s a small fridge with some complementary water in it upon arrival and refreshed every couple of days.No room service. If you want ice you have to go to the bar to get it yourself.Now the terrible bit. As lots of other reviewers have noted - the breakfast service is terrible. The lines / queues are so long to get seated. They go out past the elevator / lift area. It’s totally mobbed in the breakfast area. Food runs out quickly and is not replenished. On one day of our stay, the milk had run out in the hotel and there was only black coffee. Everybody was complaining, The Restaurant Manager (JL) was so rude and aggressive. He told guests, “well nobody has died, what’s the problem?” The problem was that whilst these things can happen, there’s no need to be so rude to your guests. We complained at reception about him - he popped up again and said there was nobody more senior on duty to complain to, except a check in supervisor. He then switched to Spanish to his colleague - another mistake as we live half in Spain and half in the UK so understood everything. We left for the UK later that day feeling very let down by this experience. Funnily enough, same as other reviewers - we went to Pret A Manger opposite for breakfast.(If the GM wants to contact me ...

I would have rated the hotel five star , but the breakfast “cafeteria style “and valet part were disappointing. There is plenty of food at the breakfast buffet , but we were not expecting a buffet with hundreds of guests eating. The breakfast was included in the price . The valet parking is not really valet parking. It is a private parking garage around the block , where you can actually self park for half the price ,and walk to the hotel. We had to wait over 90 minutes to get our car , and they wanted to charge me for the extra hour . Park yourself! There are plenty of parking garages in the area , and if you reserve ahead of time , you can find parking deals . We booked the hotel through booking.com , for a total price with all taxes , resort fees , etc. , $192 .

The accommodation was great, huge TV, great view, extremely comfortable bed. The breakfast at the hotel was very good. Yes it was busy but the (small) queue went down quickly. There was lots of seating and two parallel breakfast serving areas within the same restaurant to speed things up. I was there this week and had no problem at all with this. i read the queue goes around by the lifts, well the lifts are 8 yards away from the front of the queue so that's no big deal at all. i imagined first day of Next sale type queues!!! not at all. We ate at night as well on a half board package and the food was great. my tip is, eat all of the typical fast food for lunch out at places then eat the lovely salads and proper food at the hotel - the variety is great and 4 star if not more. there is a carving station, fish, meats, lovely deserts and so on. they do pizza and fries too so you can have all that aswell. i read the drinks were extortionate by someone and here. we got a tap water (free) and fresh orange or diet coke - cant remember exactly and it was $2.49. plus tip so i would recommend this restaurant. The hotel - obviously a Riu, but you do get a little feel of being in Spain on your 4 star holiday whilst in NYC and i say that from all of the things that you like about that (apart from the weather in NYC haha).The other little things, so - i read about the frosted glass. I was with my daughter so privacy was important. All we did for extra privacy was turn off the bathroom light when in the shower then there is no problem at all. There wasnt really a problem unless i was right against the shower wall but then i wouldnt normally do that anyway on a huge walk in shower. Also - when you run the cold tap, the water was ice cold straight away and hot straightaway. Never had this before. normally you have to run it at least a few seconds. 5 lifts so we never waited long and they were extremely fast. Excellent location - easy walk to times square and rockerfeller center. subways nearby. I tried the sofa bed for comfort too as we had a double family deluxe. it was long enough for me 5'11 but not sure 2 adults could sleep on it. 1 max or 2 small children.So all in all, i loved this hotel so much. didnt want to leave and booked already to come back. In true last day of holiday style too - i got a late check out - had to pay tho, but also used the gym and had a shower before getting a taxi - loved it!!!!

They were somewhat small although not too bad, the views were amazing but the walls were very thin. We could hear everything.

You can see exactly what people are doing, there’s no privacy at all. Not only that but our shower would flood every time we used it and it would manage to seep out into the main part of the room.Breakfast is very expensive, $19.95 + tax + tips!

Lots of people who have stayed in NYC had said not to get carried away booking a fancy hotel due to never being in it and it only being somewhere to sleep. We completely disagree. It’s important for us to have a good base. The Riu did not disappoint. It was extremely clean (top of my list). Also very modern and spacious considering we were a family of 4. We had the most comfiest beds to give us the best sleep whilst we were there. Times Square you can see if you are in the right room. Extremely close to Times Square and Broadway. Maceys, Bryant Park and Fifth Avenue were all within walking distance so fantastic base. Breakfast is fantastic! Everything you can imagine. Only downfall is that you do have to queue. When I say queue, it’s literally 5 mins if that. The later you go in the quieter it is. First morning was a bit stressful with the children and with it being so busy. We all got seated then got up to get our breakfast. Went back to the table and someone was sat on it! Can understand how this can happen with it being busy. And considering the amount of tourists they get it does seem like organised chaos! By the second day we were on the ball. One of us got all the cutlery etc and sat at our table whilst the other 3 got their breakfast and came back.By day 3 it was a breeze. Another negative..at a hotel of this level I would expect a better hair dryer in the hotel (it was terrible) and I really, really missed a kettle and coffee in the room in the morning.

We were situated on the 8th floor and although it was quite noisy at night sometimes with the traffic, it wasn't anything that ear plugs didn't sort out! Our room had plenty of space with comfortable beds, great storage for our suitcases under our beds and it was nice to have a fridge and iron too. The bathroom was also very modern, clean and had everything we needed. We thought the breakfast was great and really set us up for the day. Plenty of choice, well stocked throughout the morning and the staff work tirelessly to clean up after people leave to ensure everyone is seated quickly. We never waited more than a couple of minutes to get seated and that was at different times of the morning too.Overall, we would definitely recommend the Riu for anyone travelling to NY in the future. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to a lack of communication from the hotel before we arrived regarding organising a (paid for) surprise in our room for my mum 60th birthday.

We were not impressed and would not come back. We found the staff unfriendly, the rooms severely lacking, and the price-quality ratio completely overblown for what you can find in the area.The rooms are exceedingly small. I have stayed at POD style hotels and there is nothing wrong with that approach, but this hotel does not sell the impression that the rooms are so small that you literally have to climb over the bed to get around if a bag is on the floor. They truly spent all the money in the lobby.The rooms are described as having a desk. There is no desk. There is a shelf where your laptop will barely fit. The chair fits under said shelf, and if you want to use it you will the your back with the bed. The bathroom is separated from the room by a translucid wall, so if you have to use it in the middle of the night you will wake up anybody sleeping with you. We had a small child and this was definitely a problem.We did find the staff off-putting and generally condescending. At several times we felt treated like they were doing us a favor. This was the case with the reception, the bar, but particularly, the woman managing the entrance to the breakfast buffet who truly treated us as an annoyance literally lifting her finger to shush us while she finished her conversation with a member of the cleaning stuff. She was just downright rude and for me reason enough to not come back.The breakfast buffet was adequate. It gets very busy and very loud as the hotel is very large with lots of families, but you can avoid this getting in early.At night, we requested two dental kits when we realized we had forgotten our tooth brushes. I went downstairs to avoid the housekeeping wait (being aware how large the hotel was) and I was told to go back to my room and wait for it. It took 45 minutes and they showed up with one kit. I told them I had requested two and I waited another 20 minutes for it. I should have walked across the street and bought it at CVS.The bar is severely overpriced even for NY standards. Again, we were under the impression that a hotel of this size that announced a restaurant and bar would have options for drinks and a snack before going to bed. Not the case. Nothing to eat in the bar but you can drown your sorrows in one pint of beer for $11.Finally, when it came time to pay we realized our numbers were not matching up. Well, that is because you get it with a $13.06 ´resort´ fee per room per night. Resort? I have been to many resorts and this was definitely not one of them. This resort fee included things like ""access to the gym"" (which I did not use), ""in-room water"" (which we did not request) and Internet access (which is definitely not a resort feature). We ended up coughing $100 more than we expected and it definitely felt like a bait-and-switch. We politely complained and got our now-familiar condescending Riu treatment. We will not come back. There are many great options in the area.","New York City, New York","PedroC842</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",63,2.0

The food is lovely when they have it nothing is replenished quick enough so you have to wait ages if you want a full breakfast also in one dining room there are hash browns but not in the other so you have to go for a walk if you want anything. We did complain about the breakfast and the restaurant managers are very rude and dont seem to care on one day we just left and went across the road to Pret A Manger which defeats the purpose of paying for the breakfast if theres nothing to eat.I would have given more stars if the breakfast was better and because of the rudeness of the restaurant managers ( all other staff really lovely couldn't do more to help ).Fix this and would definitely stay again.","Sale, United Kingdom","leee892</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sale, United Kingdom</strong>",17,3.0

It is close to all the sights, walked miles and also used the yellow cabs - great way to see the City. On arrival at the Hotel early evening, we were allocated a room on the 4th floor even though I had emailed the Hotel previously to request a room above the 4th floor! So no sleep whatsoever, felt like we were by the side of the M25 motorway with the noise of sirens and disco lights in the room as the curtains were transparent! Eventually, the next day to their credit, Reception did change the Room but our first day of the holiday was not great as travelled from London plus No sleep!!! Breakfast was included in the price but we only tried it once, as was total chaos! There are lovely coffee shops all around the area - which suited us. Good things and bad things for us but this is just my opinion! Lovely Bellboys, so helpful and the Coffee Bar Staff at the entrance to the hotel were so nice.

I have really good memories of staying at different Rui Hotels all around the world but unfortunately not really at this one. The hotel itslef is very smart and clean and is perfect for a short stay in this wonderful City. My issues were not related to the hotel itself but more towards a small handfull of people that worked their. I left my bags in the room on Thursday morning before i went for a walk around the city. When checking my bags upon my return i noticed that i had some English money missing that was definitely there before i left the room. I reported this issue to the management staff and to be honest i was very disappointed in their efforts to resolve the issue. I had £40 taken out of my bag but it wasn’t theft of the money that annoyed me it was the fact that someone had been through my personal belongings and no one at the hotel seemed to care about this.

The breakfast buffet was good. Yes, occasionally they would run out of something, but it was quickly replaced. Staff is friendly, helpful, and professional. It's true that the ""bathroom"" has frosted privacy glass for the toilet and shower, but it takes a really good imagination to actually ""see"" anything -- when I was in the shower and my roommate was at the sink, the only way I could tell was the appearance of a different blurry blob of color in the vicinity of the sink. It's really not an issue.One thing to keep in mind -- you can't get the official late checkout (that costs $40 and lets you stay in the room until 4 PM) unless you schedule it ahead of time, and unless the hotel is not completely booked the evening of your departure. The hotel had no problem letting me stay until 1 PM (an hour after official checkout) at no extra charge, though (which was all I really needed).The location is fantastic -- 1 block off Times Square, and walking distance to restaurants, bars, theaters, subway, shopping, etc. I definitely would stay there again (although without the breakfast buffet next time, because I tended to overeat, LOL).",,Paradise312158,0,5.0

The customer service was completely unacceptable. We stayed in a nice, clean SMALL room on the 6th floor. When we checked in, nobody informed us that there was an apparent ""problem"" with the heating and cooling. In fact, we were given instructions on the thermostat in the room. When we walked into our room, we were hit with a wall of heat. No big deal, I thought, we will just turn on the AC. I was certainly wrong about that. The temperature instead kept rising, and it was reading 78 degrees, even though the thermostat was on 65. We called the front desk and they sent up an engineer, whose gun was reading 85 degrees when pointed at the vent. He assured us he could fix it. We went to our show, and when we returned around midnight, it was hotter than before! But yet the unit was still reading 65 degrees?!?! So again, I call the front desk. They sent up another engineer who said yes it was very hot, but he was alone and there was nothing he could do about it because it was the whole building. I requested to speak to the manager (Johan), who came up and told me that the city MANDATES the heat be on. When I questioned him, he said that it was problem with the system in the whole building. SO WAS IT A PROBLEM OR A MANDATE? His solution, open the window as he had already gotten about 8-10 complaints that night. I searched for another hotel but could not find one at almost 1am, so I had no choice put to stay there, Needless to say, I had to leave the window open and listen to the sounds of Times Square ALL NIGHT long. We did not sleep, as closing the window was not an option or we would've been dripping in sweat. When I asked to speak to the manager the next morning upon check out, the receptionist did everything in her power to ignore that I requested one, and the manager never came out to speak to me. At over $300 a night, the least your manager could've down was come out and apologize if nothing else. I disputed this with Expedia as that is who I booked through and they told me RIU has NO log of any complaint I mentioned, but when I checked out and asked to speak to the manager the receptionist saw ALL my calls. The fact that my room was almost 90 degrees was also not acceptable.

They also have usb sockets as well as standard ones, which was handy to charge up your phone. There was no kettle to make drinks, however opposite the hotel there is a dunkin donut shop which is handy for buying drinks. They also have their own hotel cafe with reasonable prices.

There was cereal, hot food, fruit, porridge, cold meat, vegetables, bread, pastries, as well as juice, water and hot drinks dispensers. Although it was very busy and crowded, we never waited around too long to be seated. We did go to their own evening buffet, which was convenient, however the waiter with short dark hair and facial hair was very rude and aggressive over a petty matter of signing in the wrong place on the tab.

It’s a modern Hotel so it’s very upto date and everything works very well. There are 5 lifts servicing all floors and they are very fast and efficient which is useful when the hotel is busy. Breakfast is your usual American Buffet and is plentiful. I didn’t go the full 5* on this occasion as it wasn’t totally perfect but I am being picky. Hard flooring in all areas and big heavy doors that close with a bang mean you are disturbed if you get inconsiderate quests on your floor. Not the hotels fault but people come and go at all hours in Manhattan so should be expected. The room was fairly small (we had a Queen) - it was big enough for us but don’t expect much privacy when using the bathroom. Our shower door leaked onto a tiled floor which wasn’t great but it was easily sorted with a towel and the maid service was excellent so every day we returned to a spotless room.

The customerservice on this hotel is not the best.Do you want a hotel because of it’s location I would live here.

Whilst the hotel is clean, comfortable and ideally located, travelers should be aware that the deluxe family rooms are small. Sure they hold 2 doubles and a sofa bed but if you intend to have 3 or even 4 in a room, it is going to be cramped, especially with luggage. The breakfast room is unbelievably busy and packed but staff do a fantastic job of getting people seated, tables cleared and constantly refreshing food. And they do it with a smile. On check in though we found front desk staff to be unaccommodating and surly. Although we booked a room for occupancy of 3 people months in advance, the 3rd (sofa) bed was not made up on arrival and we had to ask three times before it was done ! There was no water in the room so we asked for some at reception, which they said would be dispatched. It never arrived.Bar area pleasant and staff there were helpful and welcoming. Bell-hops also really cheerful and accommodating.So overall some good, some bad, hence my 3star rating.

It was so bad that we had to make a change for our remaining 2 nights in the city (I had never done this before). Fortunately, through our booking site, we were able to get this hotel for less than what we would have paid for our previous one. If that was the equivalent of a 1-star hotel (I don't care what it claimed to be!), it made this place seem like a 5+ star hotel. Bright, light, modern, clean. Bliss. Our room on the 19th floor gave great views along Broadway and from the corridor you could see out to the Hudson.The hotel is in a good location. Short walking distance to Times Square and within walking distance to Central Park, Fifth Avenue, High Line etc. It's a short walking distance from a few different subway lines. It's straightforward to get a taxi or Uber from outside. The service at the hotel was swift, polite and prompt. Couldn't speak more highly of it, particularly the guys at the bell desk. As I was in New York, I paid little interest to the facilities the hotel had. You only need a nice room for your stay really IMO. Breakfast was included, which was a nice added bonus. The only negative was how busy this turned out to be. The problem with larger buffet breakfasts like this is your always at the mercy of the behaviour of the other guests. Unfortunately, there is always going to be some people (who can't wait for their Weisswurst!!) barging halfway down the queue for the breakfast items. Or people who ignorantly stand and block main/narrow walkways. There was a member of staff assigning tables to people on arrival to the breakfast area. But perhaps they could section off parts of the serving area so that it's less chaotic; force people to walk the line for the breakfast items instead of queue jumping etc.The price to value was good considering the price of our previous hotel. However, Manhattan isn't a cheap place to stay, especially when you're only really after a clean comfortable bed to rest at the end of a long day. If you can get this hotel for a reasonable rate, I would definitely recommend staying here.

We booked through British Airways Holidays and breakfast was included. I emailed the hotel prior to arriving to request a nice high room if possible as we were staying for our wedding anniversary and wanted it to be special. The hotel were very obliging and allocated us a room on the 29th floor which helped with any noise from traffic below although you can’t hear this with the windows closed anyway. We arrived to a bottle of Champagne and a card wishing us Happy Anniversary from the hotel which was a nice touch. We were very happy with our room which was a deluxe king room with a comfy bed and a spacious bathroom with toiletries replenished every day as were the towels. The room was very well looked after by housekeeping and cleaned every day we couldn’t fault it. The food in the restaurant at breakfast was very good, only problem was the plates weren’t always warmed so the food went cold quickly , the restaurant always felt a little crowded as though you were on top of each other but we only had breakfast daily so that was fine. All the staff were pleasant and helpful at all times and they are all a credit to the hotel.

You would be amazed at how many hotels still put it in our rooms despite a request being made ahead each time. The room was spacious by NYC standards, spotless and no noise from outside. Breakfast had something for everyone, was tasty and wholesome but a little chaotic. We chose to go for the half board option as we have been to NYC many times and experienced many restaurants and wanted something non hassle at the end of our busy day. There was plenty of choice, we only ate here 2 nights butt different choices both nights, all fresh and lovely, only thing that left a lot to be desired was the pizza, otherwise, food great, easy to get a table and service also great.

I've read some complaints about the breakfast in other reviews. We found nothing wrong with it. The food was hot, plenty of it, and choices for every taste. As in every hotel buffet meals are spoiled by the selfish minority who seem to think that every meal is going to be their last one and charge around causing chaos. Friendly staff, lots of them, and with breakfast being available until 11am no need to panic. I found Kenneth in the restaurant was especially helpful. My only complaint about Riu Plaza is the Fashion Bar. A large beer, (about a pint) and a small Amaretto cost $27. Come on Riu, you have four stars so stop charging five star prices.

Whilst talking about the staff, we never met anyone who wasn’t polite, welcoming and professional, these staff are a credit to this hotel. The room was very clean and had a safe, fridge, TV, iron and ironing board. Although we only had breakfast in the hotel it had a large selection of fresh food that would cater for all tastes.

Room was amazing, clean and very modern. We had a 24th floor room with a view over New York and the Hudson River. Some people had mentioned the bathroom with it’s frosted glass wall and was a tad apprehensive as we had taken our daughter for her 21st but it really wasn’t a problem. If you turned the bathroom light on you could see the outline of your body but if you left the light off you really couldn’t see a thing. We just used light from the room itself when showering so wasn’t an issue at all. They do a buffet breakfast each day which was really good and had a choice that would suit any palate. If you have enough to eat at breakfast it sees you for the day and saves a fortune in eating out through the day. The hotel staff were lovely and really friendly definitely made the right choice with this hotel. It is situated on the corner of 8th and 46th street so a couple mins walk from Times Square and all the other main attractions. Also on the same street as all the restaurants the locals call it Restaurant Alley so never short of choice of places to eat and on your hotel doorstep.

It smelled like something was wet. Once I sprayed the room the smell went away and wasn't has noticeable. The shower doors do not close all the way therefore you will have the floor a mess when you finish. The executive lounge was the best thing ever.

Everything from check in to check out was done with perfection. On the day of check-in our flight arrived in the city quite early around 1030am. We went to the hotel and they were very helpful and stored our luggage until check-in time. We went back to the hotel close to 2pm to see if a room was available early as we had tickets to a show at 3pm. We got Joanne at the front desk. She was so friendly and helpful. Not only was she able to accommodate our early check in but she also upgraded us to the executive floor. We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and this was such an amazing surprise and lovely touch. We had half board, which includes the breakfast and dinner buffets. We hadn’t planned on eating dinner at the hotel but were very impressed with the buffet, so we ended up eating there almost every night. The first night, the staff at the dinner buffet was extraordinary! I wish I had gotten names because they worked great as a team, were very attentive to customers and just made you feel welcomed. All the staff were great at the hotel, but these ones were just exceptional. Breakfast included – eggs (scrambled or over medium), bacon, sausage, pancakes or waffles, a variety of fruit, pastries, breads, etc. Breakfast is very busy, so I suggest going before 8am. The line can get quite long – both to get in and to get food. We were up early every day, so we never had to wait long. Dinner buffet had a wide variety of foods, including a carving station, a seafood station, various meats, pastas, veggies, pizzas, soup, etc. The dinner buffet was never busy. I know you go to New York for the food but we were on a budget and this allowed us to still have a delicious dinner and instead enjoy lunch and late night snacks out which was easier on the bank. Our king room was on the small side but that is expected for New York. Nonetheless, it was perfect for the two of us and had everything we needed. The room was spotless and had a great view of the city. The whole hotel, including the room, is very modern. The shower did leak a bit onto the floor in the bathroom/front area as noted on other reviews. I agree something the hotel should consider fixing to avoid mold issues in the future but definitely not a huge issue.We had access to the executive lounge which includes access to a room with sofas, chairs, tables, TV, snacks (chips, sandwiches, pastries, nuts, etc.), wine (red, white and rose), variety of pop, tea, coffee and bottled water. I would definitely pay the extra for this level of room next time we go. We requested a late check out on the morning of check out. They were able to accommodate our request for an extra fee which was well worth it since our flight didn’t leave until 6pm. Check out was a breeze, just put your room key in a box and done. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Not only is the hotel amazing but location is ideal – within walking distance to just about everything and close to all subway lines.

Check-in was speedy and efficient and staff were helpful and accommodating. The room itself, although small (expected), was bright, modern and clean with an iron, safe and air-conditioning. The hotel is eco-friendly and will only change your sheet/towels etc if you leave a hanger on the door which works perfectly as I wouldn't change my bedsheets daily at home so I welcomed this environmentally friendly approach. The Riu is perfect in location, just a few minutes walk to Times Square and across the road from the hop-on hop-off buses. If you want to use the subways, these are within walking distance (we used the 42nd street station from Brooklyn and walked the 6-8mins back to hotel). Breakfast offers a selection of hot food (I can't comment as I didn't try), fruit, pastries, cereals, yoghurts, different breads for toasting and hot drinks from a self-serve machine. Yes there was a queue even though we went at different times but staff were super organised and got you seated within minutes! Overall, we had a great stay at the Riu and I would definitely recommend. The only thing I would say that if you are like me and enjoy a cuppa before you even leave the room in the morning then bring a travel kettle as there are no in-room facilities. There is however, a cafe attached to the hotel via a side door that sells hot drinks and snacks but as we were on the 21st floor, this didn't seem an option if we were coming down for breakfast anyway.

This hotel is only 2 years old which is evident through the modern and funky decor throughout the hotel. It is sleek, clean and has all the amenties you need for a great city stay. Upon check in we were informed that the hotel was fully booked and that our rooms had been upgraded to the next category as a result of booking directly with the hotel. Our rooms were located on the 26th floor where we enjoyed superb views from our floor length windows from our rooms. Our upgrade meant we had the benefits of accessing the complimentary lounge which was stocked with both hot and cold beverages and snacks. It was a superb touch which made our stay even more special. This is perhaps one of the few hotels in central Manhatten that offers a fully cooked breakfast to it's guests, which was included in our price and the food was of good quality and there was ample of choice. Although breakfast tended to get busy resulting in some queues to be seated (around 9am seems to be the most busy period) it was all efficent and food was stocked continously. Breakfast was served until 10am which set us up for the day. The Customer Service in the hotel was excellent. Despite it being a large and busy hotel (over 600 rooms), staff were all friendly and efficient. One I could not work my hairdryer I called the reception and within minutes a maintainence guy arrived in my room to fix it. It turned out the hairdryer was not faulty, I had not seen the switch on the side. Although I had expected the rooms to be compact, our upgrade to a king room and king suite meant that we enjoyed larger rooms which were great. The bathrooms were modern and well equipped with large shower cubicles. The hotel is within walking distance to Times Square and tourist spots but at the same time located away from the immediate hustle and bustle. The hotel is right at the beginning of the infamous 'Restaurant Row' where you can find all sorts of restaurants reflecting the diversity of the City and some which provided live music and dance, which was lovely to see. This hotel is definitely one of the more modern and sleeker hotels located centrally. We throrougly enjoyed our stay and I would defintely stay at this hotel again or when I return to New York. My only criticism is that there are no tea and coffee making facilties in the rooms. Thank You Riu for exceeding our expectations. We would definitely recommend you.

We have been loyal to the Riu brand for many years and will continue to be so, because of the service, style and generally excellently run hotels, but we will never stay at this hotel again.On our day of arrival we were already in the US so I phoned to see if we could have an early check in, especially as we are Riu Class loyalty members of many years standing. The lady on the phone told me that she couldn’t help (even though I’d been put through to reception), but should ask on arrival. So, on arrival, we went to reception and was told quite abruptly that check in is at 3.00 pm but they could store our bags.We left our luggage and went out. On our return, our luggage was not in a secure room but left in a corridor off reception!Having checked in, we went up to our room, a “king” double. Someone has a weird sense of humour if our shoebox could be described as a king anything.Not much room, not much hanging space and apart from the bedside tables, no drawer space.Next morning we went down for breakfast. Oh dear, oh dear. Scenes of chaos greeted us. There was a queue which blocked the main lift area and snaked down and up stairs.Fortunately, the queue moved quickly and on entering the breakfast room, our first and only impression was that we had walked into a downmarket cafeteria by mistake. This certainly wasn’t Riu!The choice wasn’t, the style certainly wasn’t, and the service, or total lack of it certainly wasn’t.The next morning we went to a different breakfast room, smaller and because we were early, nice and quiet. This morning we went to the same one, but whereas yesterday, the tables were laid with cutlery, napkins and sugar etc., today we were told to go get our own!I wanted scrambled eggs. The container was empty. I had to wait around 5 minutes before someone ambled our the kitchen with fresh supplies. This is NOT Riu!!!!There are various other things that are far from our expectation of Riu, but I think I’ve rambled on enough.I think that one of the major obstacles facing Riu is that those of you who have visited Riu hotels, whether Classic, Palace, or AI Resorts, will know that Riu has a certain style, a similarity and familiarity with the way they do things, which they do very well, but this is New York, where to put it simply, the service ethic that made the US something special, has completely vanished, and I believe that Riu will have an uphill struggle to get this hotel to the level that loyal Riu customers expect.","Leeds, United Kingdom","paulhZ2221BC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",24,3.0

One of the days, we were seated at a table, we left to get our food and some other Maitre D' seated another party in our table. Lots of confusion. On our last day though, they checked our room number then let us seat ourselves (I think this is a better idea - keep it up). 2. I had coffee the first day in the restaurant and the coffee cup handle just came off dropping hot coffee all over our table. It would help if the staff checked the cups and glasses once out of wash.

The hotel is a nice place to stay, the room was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable. It wasn't a big room but big enough to hang out in and use as a base. However the safe in our room was broken. We put our things in it but then it wouldn't unlock. Maintenance did come and try to fix it but couldn't so we had to call them when we needed our things. Breakfast was fine.

Unfortunately an hour before, I think it was actually less than an hour before, we had checked out. I wasn't feeling unwell when we checked out. When we returned to the hotel and I was visually distressed we asked if we could pay the extra (and offered to pay more) for our room back so I could rest. At this point the staff became very awkward and unkind towards us and said that if we wanted to use their hotel it would be just shy of $200. I was desperate to lay down so we paid - we stayed for around 2 hours. We knew our original room had not been cleaned yet so the hotel staff could have been helpful and just let us use it again for a fee but chose not to be sympathic or helpful. For this reason alone I would not use this hotel or any hotel in the Riu chain again. Even if they couldn't give us our original room back and we had to pay full price for another room there was no need to make a distressing situation worse by being unkind and awkward.

This hotel is a welcome taste of Europe in NYC. I am not exaggerating that this is one of the best hotels for the money that I have stayed in. First, hotel rooms in NYC are closet sized. I have been in hotels where there was not enough room to walk around the bed. RIU's rooms are spacious for NY standards. There is a lot done with mirror and paint to make the rooms feel larger than they are. Second, the decor is not your run of the mill chain beige and faux marble. It's white and lavender, which may feel odd but to me that was a refreshing change. Third, the bathroom is also spacious for NY. In my previous go-to hotel, the nook where the toilet sits is so narrow that I have only 2-3 inches of clearance on either sides of my shoulders ,and I am not huge. Plus the shower and its controls are better than standard. I see a lot of complaints about noise here, but again in comparison to other hotels in NY, this was quiet in the lobby and maybe I am just too tired after a day out and about in NY to notice the noise but I found the room a respite from the auditory attack of the city. I also had a view of 8th avenue and I have never gotten a view of anything more than a brick wall in other hotels. The location is at the corner of 8th and 46th, which is in close to Times Square but at the start of Restaurant Row so the street is filled with small, charming restaurants in a street that isn't made up of skyscrapers. It's very pleasant. What made me book this hotel in the first place over my go-to hotel which is just across the street is that a full hot breakfast is included for the same price I would pay at the go-to. I expected a typical American hotel hot breakfast: carbs in every form with some plastic eggs. This was where the European feel of the hotel is most pronounced. There was every kind of cooked breakfast meat imaginable as well as smoked salmon and prosciutto, a selection of cheeses and breads, waffles, pastries, scrambled eggs that were neither runny nor overcooked as well as hard boiled eggs. The highlight was the fresh fruit: all fresh and sweet and included pineapple and even blackberries. Yes the coffee, even though espresso and cappuciano was offered from the press-a-button-to- brew machine, wasn't great, but I don't expect coffee in most US eateries to be good. Finally, the staff was friendlier and more efficient than I have experienced in other hotels. To check in there was only one person in front of me. The bag check also was not backed up and the bell boy was friendly. Some reviewers have complained about the added fees once even thought they prepaid. Be aware that all hotels in NY do this. The added on ""facility fee"" for internet and gym is actually half the price of other hotels I have been in. Annoying as hell yes, but that's the way it is in NY. Still two of us stayed here in June for just under $200.

The first receptionist informed me that my booking was invalid as I didn't have my original card that I had booked with (I wasn't too surprised as this has happened to me before and I should have learnt my lesson). I was informed that I needed to call my husband in the UK so that he could show the credit card to the receptionist. I did this and then another VERY RUDE receptionist came along and said that actually wasn't good enough and she would need a scan of his passport and the credit card emailed to her immediately. I asked if she couldn't just cancel the reservation and re-debit another card that I had in my possession? I was then informed that she didn't like the tone of my voice and that she didn't appreciate my sarcasm. I was gobsmacked. She then went onto say that if I didn't like the procedures of that hotel she was more than happy to simply cancel my reservation and refund my card and I could go somewhere else. (despite saying that she couldn't cancel and re-book earlier!) Eventually the information was scanned by my husband and sent and she finally wound her neck in.

Then this is the place!! RIU Plaza New York, opened in 2016, the first of the famous RIU chain to open in America. For those of you who know RIU from all-inclusives in Mexico and the Caribbean, you know the quality here. This is a true 4+ star only two blocks from Times square. From here we walked to Empire State, Macy's to all the tour bus routes, even to the Intrepid Air and Sea Museum on the Hudson River. We stayed in rm 2818. This is a suite on the 28th of 30 floors overlooking 8th ave. Fantastic spacious room, king bed,spa tub, dual sinks, separate shower and water closet, living room area with sofa, coffee table as well as small dining table with two chairs & with flat screen tv that swivels to face either the bed to the north or sofa to the south. Also full hot buffet breakfast is included! Eggs, bacon, sausages, baked goods, fruit, cheeses, yogurt, cereal, pancakes, potatoes, cappuccino, lattes, hot chocolate....and so much more. Filling up on a great breakfast like this is the perfect way to start a busy day in NYC. I was there over Memorial day weekend, and even though the hotel was very busy, we never waited more than 2 minutes to be seated at the buffet. Great efficiency and service!Also since our room was a suite, we had 24hr access to the executive lounge on the 26th floor. This lounge has complimentary red, white and zinfandel wines, coffee, tea, soda, bottled water, finger sandwiches, potato chips, croissants, muffins, yogurt and giant cups of delicious fruit salad, all included, 24hrs a day. What a wonderful added bonus. No need to run out for a snack when you feel hungry and a great place to take in the view with a glass of wine in the evening!!! Cannot find fault in this hotel, and the price is fantastic. It's less than most good hotels in NYC and you get so much more.

I have been recentely in Vienna for work and the hotel I stayed in had a similar bad taste decoration, the bathroom was as small as the Riu, you have everything you need but only that. It follows the well known IKEA style.2) But when coming to NYC you want to find a traditional american hotel, with lots of wood on the ambiance, good carpets and confortable sofas, huge bathrooms and lots of confort.3) The Riu is located in 8th avenue and 46th. Try to stay between 5th and 7th and up 50th street and there is such a big difference!4) Breakfast is not bad but is so full of people that you won´t have the possibility to eat slowly and in peace.

So I do not agree you will need earplugs for the sound. You will need them for your neighbours. We had a very loud, I guess, Italian family next to us with a baby. Since the rooms have ‘in between’ doors you can literally hear anything your neighbour is doing or saying. It’s terrible, especially when the baby cries two or three times at night-time. The room itself is everything you need for a trip to New York and for New York rooms quite spacious. Staff is friendly, cleaning could be better. The breakfast is OK.

You can’t see skin but you can see what’s going on, so be forewarned if you go with a colleague or someone else where that might feel odd!However... As we were checking our bags to leave, the gentleman who took the bags asked us how we would be getting to the airport. We told him we planned to call an Uber or grab a taxi. He told us that would be very expensive and said the hotel could arrange a cab for us for a flat rate of $55, which would include tax, tolls, and tip. Since that seemed like a no-hassle option, we took it. He gave me a receipt on which he had written $75 would be due to the driver. I took it back to him and he aplogized and corrected it to $55 as he had quoted. We took the cab, which was a black SUV not a yellow cab, and when we got to the airport the driver asked for $74.95. I explained we were told the rate was a flat $55 and that I had a paper to prove it. The driver said that did not include tax, tolls, or tip, just the ride itself. He was extremely rude and demanding. We paid what he asked and got away from him. I do not know if this is a scam between the hotel employees and the drivers, or just the drivers, or if the hotel is involved in cheating customers like this. It was a very sour end to what had been a wonderful visit. What a shame for our final impression of this hotel to be that we were duped and cheated out of money.

The main reason was because we are familiar with the brand here in Spain and it was also on the price which offered us 5 nights including all taxes & breakfast for two people at a little under $1,500. It may seem a lot to some people, but find me a 4 or 5-star hotel in the heart of one of the most expensive hotel city’s in the world for that price at high season would be a challenge.We asked for a twin double-double room simply for space but due to the high demand for these rooms we got allocated a king double room on check in and asked to check back in the morning for a alternative room. We were given room 2919 on the very top floor with views to the east and south and loved it so much we stayed. So the room was not big, but it’s NY and you are there to enjoy the city, not the room, right! The bed was so comfortable and huge! I loved that we could let air in rather than use the air con which we never needed to use. The shower gave out great pressure and the bathroom offered nice toiletries. Housekeeping was very good.Breakfast was served from 07:00 every morning in the ‘fashion restaurant’ on the 1st floor (ground floor) and was a typical affair of juices, breads, pastries, eggs, bacon, cold cuts, cheeses etc. Staying 5 nights I’d have liked to seen a little more variety even if just on a few items maybe replacing pancakes for waffles and another morning for churros. The coffee was really poor though, then again, I think coffee in the USA as a whole is poor. I struggle to find coffee I liked anywhere in the city.I also liked that the staff were not over friendly and false. We came into contact with a lot of staff in the elevator going from level LL to other floors and all were really lovely...maybe that I speak Spanish helps too. Great WiFi strength everywhere.

The hotel is perfectly located, we could walk to most things including the intreped sea air and space museum and took the subway to battery park for the statue of liberty ferry and Ellis Island tour. We then walked the short walk to the 911 site and freedom tower. If you are quite active then most attractions are within walking distance and a great way to see the city. We purchased a New York explorers pass which I feel definitely saved us money. I would highly recommend the harbour lights tour. You pick up the ferry for this right near the intrepid museum at around 6.30pm, it departs at 7pm and takes you all around the sights and it's beautiful just as sun is setting and then when the city lights up.

No complaints about that but the concierge Patricia was not very friendly. I had a question about getting tickets for the Yankee Stadium and she was not very pleased to look up something. Besides she mixed English and Spanish when she was talking to me. I speak Spanish so I asked her wheter it was easier for her to speak Spanish. She answered me: 'don't you understand me in English or what?' but with a not so nice tone. So I asked if we could get tickets over there and she said 'maybe, I don't know'. And I saw some Spanish native speakers over there and she changed her tone immediately and making phone calls for them to check... so that was not a very nice experience. The other person at the desk was friendly.Breakfast was very good. A big room devided in two parts. A lot of choice but sometimes empty. It took a while when they refilled it.Rooms are nice and clean but was a bit tiny for 3 persons. Okay, we don't need much space but could be a bit bigger. The room misses some small important equipment like a clockradio and a filled minibar. The clockradio is very important to see the time or a wake up call during the night.

As for the hotel 4/5 is what I would score it its a comfortable 3-4 star hotel not too pretentious as some can be. 5 minutes from Time Square, the bus tours set out across the main road and are worth doing, All the main attractions are within walking distance but be warned were comfy shoes we averaged 8 miles a day!

I chose the Riu Plaza Times Square based on the reviews it had and the fairly recent renovations it has gone through. Room: We stayed in 2207. We had a large bed which was very comfortable. Our room looked out over a cracking skyline. Despite only being one avenue away from Times Square it was not noisy at all. In fact you wouldn’t even know where you were located led in bed! We had a large tv on the wall at the end of the bed with plenty of channels to watch. Oh and there are USB ports by the side of the bed so you can charge your phone, iPads etc really easily without needing American converter plugs! Our bathroom was great. Huge power shower, with plenty of hot water. Complimentary shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, soap, body lotion and shower caps were available. The towels were also white and fluffy, and more importantly clean! Hairdryer was very powerful for one so small. I’ve got thick medium length hair and it didn’t take any longer than it does at home to dry it. Staff: Check in and check out were both very quick and efficient. Staff were friendly without being intrusive. Hotel Bar: We used this most evenings. They do a happy hour offer on certain cocktails, wines and beers between 4pm-midnight every day. Very reasonably priced. Breakfast: We never had an issue being seared for breakfast straight away. Plenty of food which was replenished very quickly due to the amount of people using it. I had sausage patties, fried eggs, crispy streaky bacon, smoked salmon.. plenty of choice along with cereals, toast and pastries. Minute Maid Orange Juice.. a favourite of mine from school along with plenty of hot drinks. I’d say the only downside was that there wasn’t a plug near the mirror in our room so when I straightened my hair I couldn’t see what I was doing. But then again I’ve been straightening it for long enough now that I don’t really need a mirror! I did take curling tongs but didn’t end up using them for this reason. But then again, the hour that I would have spent curling my hair, was instead spent touring the city! Much more beneficial! Wi-fi was free and had a strong connection throughout the hotel. You could even pick it up from outside the hotel. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and wouldn’t think twice about rebooking.. in-fact I’ve already been on British Airways website looking at deals for 2019! Great job Riu Plaza!

Reviews saying rooms were small gave us concerns before travelling but we shouldn’t have worried there was more than enough room for us all and 4 large suitcases. Another concern was the frosted glass for the shower - again total unecessary to be worried - yes it is glass but at most you can see a slight shadow/ silhouette nothing more so not a problem. The location is superb - less than a 2 minute walk to the heart of Times Square. We found it perfect especially as the hop on hop off tour bus tickets that we purchased had a bus stop right outside too. The company we bought from was Top View. Concierge were great at the hotel - they even loaned us umberellas free of charge when it was pouring down and sorted us a fixed rate taxi to the airport when we checked out.  The hotel itself is ultra modern and rooms were clean and modern too - the front desk staff were so friendly when we checked in - really can’t praise them enough.

So it was with much relief when we arrived to find a clean, bright, modern hotel that offered so much. Check in and check out were both smooth and quick and front desk staff were professional and courteous. We did have an issue with luggage storage. We arrived too early to check in and had to check out several hours before our flight so we left our bags with the bellman. On both occasions it took a long time to retrieve the bags. The room was more like a bedroom than a hotel room. It was small but had floor to ceiling windows, a very comfortable Queen bed, two night stands, a fridge with complimentary bottled water, a closet with a safe, iron and ironing board and a great flat screen TV with many channels. The WiFi worked well throughout the hotel. We were on the 17th floor and heard only the very occasional siren. Otherwise it was blissfully quiet. We were very fortunate to be near other quiet guests. We could definitely hear conversations from other rooms and the doors closed with a very loud bang if you weren't careful. But thankfully we experienced very little noise at all.The room was cool but we didn't want to play around with the thermostat because of the reviews we read about the potential heating concerns at the hotel. We simply called for a blanket and were quickly delivered a comfy fleece one that even matched the mauve colours of the room.The toilet would not stop flushing at one point and nobody came when we first called the front desk. The bathroom door is only sliding glass so it doesn't help with sound proofing. So we left the room and spoke to the front desk again. We returned several hours later to find the problem fixed and there were no other problems. Regarding the bathroom, it was just smoked glass so you could see the shadow of your co-guest as they were bathing. Not a big deal. There were shower caps, skin lotion, hair conditioner and bars of soap at the large sink and a squeeze bottle of body soap/shampoo on the wall of the shower. This squeeze bottle ran empty during our visit and was not automatically replaced. We had to call the front desk to have one delivered.The food at breakfast was ample and perfect for us. We have food allergies yet we had a lot of choice. There were bagels and breads, cereals, orange juice, coffee and several kinds of tea. The hot chocolate was a highlight for one in our party. Scrambled and sunny-side-up eggs, two kinds of sausage, bacon, waffles /pancakes and breakfast potatoes with peppers made up the hot portion of the buffet while there was smoked salmon, ham, salami and several cheeses in the cold section. There was also fresh fruit including various melons and pineapple.Last but not least was the excellent location of this hotel. Attending shows was our main reason for our trip. By staying here we never had more than a 10-minute walk from any theatre. At the same time we were just short walks to the subway, Times Square, the New York Times and the Hop-on Hop-off tour buses. The Riu concierge staff, near the front entrance, is extremely helpful and informative. Beware the tour bus ticket sellers outside the hotel (and all over Times Square). They work on commission and are very persistent. The Riu concierge staff was very helpful in ensuring we picked the right tour without the hard sell. The concierge staff was also helpful in booking a reasonably priced non-stop shuttle for our return to the airport (although if you don't have much luggage, the subway is a close, fast and inexpensive option).

The lobby is splashy contemporary and the rooms are a pretty good size for Manhattan. (All hotel rooms in Manhattan are smaller than average, which can surprise you if you’re not prepared for it.) You probably won’t spend a lot of time in the room so it’s fine. Elevators were fast and the staff was friendly. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. One caution if you’re traveling with kids - we stayed on the 27th floor and the bottom third of the window opens! My kids are a bit older, but it could be dangerous with smaller kids. The breakfast buffet was fine, but hectic. They had some healthy options and a cappuccino machine. Also, breakfast was included with our room so that was a money saver. Overall a good choice.

The choice of restaurants is overwhelming, Everything from fine dining, to takeaway Pizza slices is on offer with prices to suit every budget. There are the usual souvenir shops as well as small corner shop grocery stores and several branches of Duane Reade/Walgreens which stocks just about everything you will need during your stay, snacks, toiletries, medication, drinks including wine and beer (if purchasing alcohol make sure you have ID as we were asked for it at one branch - my husband and I are in our 50s!)Arrival and check-in - We arrived at the Riu at about 5.30 pm and we were immediately impressed with the lobby. There was no queue at check-in and we were dealt with quickly. I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival via email requesting a room on a higher floor and we were allocated a room on the 22 floor. We left our bags with the hotel porter and they were delivered to our room immediately.Room - We were allocated room 2201 which turned out to be a disabled accessible room. The room had two double beds, was a decent size for New York, and was spotlessly clean. We had a great view facing uptown and with a side view of the Hudson River. As stated in the hotel description the room contained a small desk and mini fridge which contained two complementary bottles of water which were replaced daily. The fridge was big enough for a few cold drinks and a bottle of wine. I knew prior to arrival that there were no inroom tea/coffee making facilities so took a travel kettle and mugs/glasses with us. The flat screen TV had a large selection of channels, not that we were in the room much to watch it. We found the beds to be very comfortable and they were raised off the ground so that luggage could be stored under them. The built in wardrobe contained an electronic safe, iron and ironing board. The room lacked storage space for clothing. We were three adults and there were eight clothes hangers between us. The only drawer space was in the small bedside table, so there was no where to put underwear, personal items etc.I knew when booking the hotel that the bathroom had a frosted glass wall between the shower and the bedroom. Because this was a disabled accessible room there was a solid wall instead as well as a shower curtain. There were ample clean towels and these were replaced daily. Complimentary toiletries consisted of a all in one shower gel/shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap. The shower was great with a rain fall and hand held shower head, good water pressure and plenty of hot water.Being in New York we knew we would hear street noise whilst in our room. This was not excessively loud even with the window open and added to the experience of being in NYC. Contrary to some other reviewers we experienced no noise distrubance from other guests whilst in their rooms or the corridor even though the hotel had 100% occupancy during part of our stay.I had read other reviews which complained about problems with the air con. We also had this problem. The room on arrival was very warm and adjusting the aircon had no effect. We ended up sleeping on top of the bed covers the first few nights. We found the only solution was to turn off the air con and open the window. As this is a common complaint the hotel really needs to look into it so the problem can be fixed.Wi-fi and computers - We were able to log on to the wifi without any problems and the speed was good. We did discover that there is a maximum of four devices per room that could log on. This caused a small problem for us as being from the UK we couldn't use the mobile data on our phones due to the high cost so had no choice but to use the hotel wifi. We also had a Macbook, and two tablets so weren't able to connect all our devices.There are several computers and a printer located behind the lifts for guests to use and they were handy for printing out tickets, boarding passes. The only problem we encountered was parents allowing their young children to 'play' on them unsupervised.Lifts - There are five main lifts. We never waited more than a couple of minutes for one and they were very fast to the point where your ears would pop.Breakfast - Buffet breakfast was included in our stay and on our first morning we went down at about 7.30 am. We were greeted at the entrance of the breakfast room next to the lifts and were informed that they were very busy but that breakfast was also served in the main restaurant, Fashion, and beside the Grab and Go cafe. We were seated immediately in the Fashion restaurant and were happy with the selection on offer. Apple and orange juice, tea, coffee, to drink. Four types of cereal, various breads, rolls, bagels, muffins, croissant and sweet pastries. Hot items consisted of bacon, sausage links, turkey sausage patties, scrambled eggs, hash browns or breakfast potatoes, waffles, pancakes. Cold items to choose from were cold meats and cheeses, smoked salmon, tomatoes, cucumber, fresh fruits such as melon, strawberries, pineapple. Food was replenished promptly.Dining - We ate at the hotel one night and found the food to be good and very reasonably priced.Check-out - On our last night the hotel was at 100% capacity so we were expecting a queue at check-out. Surprisingly this was not the case and we were dealt with quickly. We were able to leave our luggage with the porters so that we could make the most of our last day.Overall we thought the Riu Plaza Times Squre was a great hotel with a few niggly problems. All the staff we had contact with were friendly and helpful and took pride in their job. It was great value for money and I would definitely stay here again.","North Shields, United Kingdom","puddletink</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Shields, United Kingdom</strong>",137,4.0

The room was nice. The location was excellent. The wifi was excellent. We were on the 9th floor, not a great view, but we weren't in the room much so it didn't matter. The elevators were impressively fast and smooth. We got a deal that included breakfast and the breakfast was good. Service started at 7am, so we were out of luck the morning we checked out. There was no 'to go bag' option, no to go coffee, no refund, just a mechanical apology. One morning, my husband had a conference call at 8am and I went to the breakfast room in search of coffee. That was not an option. I was directed to the Dunkin' Donuts around the corner, which was odd because the hotel operates a cafe called Capital Grab-n-Go which can be accessed from the lobby, at the end of the front desk, hidden behind the bellhop stand. I wasn't aware of this, so went back upstairs to put on my coat and hat, walked outside, then immediately to the left saw this cafe and got our two, to go coffees, returned directly to the lobby without going back outside. The only other negative was the hairdryer which was small yet powerful, but the cord barely reached to the mirror which was extremely frustrating. Otherwise, staying here was a very good experience. We flew into LaGuardia and took the M60 bus to the Astoria metro station then took the metro to 42nd Street. We bought the metro/bus card at the airport then it was necessary to use that card outside at a machine to purchase a bus ticket. It was easy and inexpensive because we knew the procedure thanks to info on TA and a helpful, random person at the machine, but lots of folks were confused and the bus driver didn't help them, saying to one woman who asked about the price, ""I don't know. I don't ride the bus.""","Palm Harbor, Florida","dragonflytw65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Harbor, Florida</strong>",404,4.0

They always look great, but the rest of the hotel rarely matches the expectations set by it. Having said that, the rooms at the Riu Plaza Times Square aren’t as bad as some other hotels in NYC with impressive lobbies. They’re not brilliant though. For UK readers, if a Premier Inn and a Travel Lodge had a love child, it’d look like a room at this hotel (except you’d get more space in a Premier Inn). We stayed in a twin room and after the beds and the bathroom and a sofa that’s big enough for 2 if you like to be cosy, there isn’t really any room to put your suitcases unless you want to be sliding them under and out from the bed. The room had a small mini fridge in it and the 2 bottles of water in it were replaced when used. Fancy a morning cuppa when you wake up – no chance as there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. You could always buy one from downstairs though. Make sure you are very comfortable with whoever you’re sharing a room with as the bathrooms aren’t exactly private. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn’t slide shut. It slides in front of the door frame leaving a nice gap for you to see whoever is sat on the toilet should you look in that direction at the wrong time. If you don’t see them, you’ll certainly hear them. The back wall of the shower is glass, looking into the bedroom. Whilst the glass is sort of frosted, the bathroom lights mean you can definitely see very revealing shadows. Some people have mentioned noise in their reviews; we stayed on the 18th floor and traffic noise wasn’t a problem, the only time we heard it was when it was a siren which you could hear anywhere that had a road in the vicinity. The noise we had problems with was other residents. The doors to the rooms are heavy and swing shut with a very loud bang which can be heard all along the corridor. Now one of the good things about the hotel is its location. It’s 2 minutes from Times Square, is close to a lot of transport links and many key attractions are a short walk. However, it’s this proximity that means it seems to attract a certain crowd. This isn’t a quiet hotel by any means. You will hear people in the next rooms very clearly and we experienced large families who had got 2 or 3 rooms on a corridor shouting to each other across the way, opening and slamming their doors every 20 seconds. We also very clearly heard people who had come to party come crashing back into their rooms very early in the mornings too. If you want a quiet hotel pay the extra for a very nice hotel and book somewhere that is nowhere near Times Square. Breakfast at the hotel is a very big buffet with a wide selection of choices – not necessarily healthy but hey, it is the U.S. The breakfast room itself is very plastic and feels a bit like a truck stop or a school canteen with everyone crammed very closely together. The hotel restaurant for evening meals is tiny and the menu is your basic fast food. Nothing special. The bar does do decent happy hour cocktails though and has some nice wine so maybe just stick to drinks. Given America is supposed to pride itself on customer service, some of the hotel staff could maybe do with a refresher course. Reception staff tended to be quite surly bordering on rude, but the staff in the breakfast room were a lot more pleasant. All in all, if you’re looking for somewhere to rest your head for a few hours and be close to Times Square this is the hotel for you, but if you’re wanting more, I’d definitely say book elsewhere.","London, United Kingdom","GSPW76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,2.0

Check in took no time at all and we were in our room within 15 minuts of arriving. Had a twin room on the 17th floor. Good sized west facing room with 2 double beds, good bathroom, room safe and plenty of room under the beds for storing luggage. First morning (Saturday) there was a 30 minute wait for a table for breakfast but as we were a table of 2 got a table within a couple of minutes. Standard but plentiful breakfast included in the room rate, breads, bakery, fruits, eggs, bacon, sausages, juices, tea, coffee etc There are two areas for breakfast so they turn over tables pretty quickly. With the marathon the next day there was much activity so getting the lift up to and down from the 17th floor sometimes took a while but not a big inconvenience really. Good gym, good business centre for printing tickets etc. The hotel is modern, clean and efficient and yes there is some noise from the corridors and hallways but was never an issue that detracted from our time in the room. Will definitely stay here again next time as it is very close to Times Square (3 minute walk), Madison Square Garden, Theatre District, Central Park, Empire State Building and public transport.

The breakfast is overpriced and bland. Skip it and find a better place just down the street. The rooms are spotless, the beds are comfortable , the decor is Target.

It could be quite busy but they always managed to accommodate tables near each other for our party of 10.Perfectly placed, the hotel is a short stroll from Times Square, directly across the road from a number of hop on/ hop off tours and various subway stations. There are some very good quality restaurants, bars and shops within minutes of the hotel. Grand central, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Empire State and Madison square gardens are all an easy walk from the hotel.Myself and my family loved this hotel and would highly recommend it! The only negative I have is that the sewer lines directly outside the main door were emptied 3 days out of the 5 we were there and the smell is horrendous both outside and in the reception area. We heard someone say it should only be done at night, I’m not sure this is something RIU has any control over though!

The only reason I haven’t given 5 stars is because the weekend we were there, there was no breakfast on offer. The restaurant and bar was shut. We were refunded $25 each for breakfast but it was still inconvenient to have to go and find somewhere to get breakfast or a drink etc. Also the first night we stayed we were woken at 5am by a fire alarm, we couldn’t get back to sleep after this which made us tired for our first day in New York as we’d travelled for 15 hours the day before. Both issues were unavoidable and no fault of the hotel, just unfortunate for our stay. Which at nearly £500 for 3 nights was pretty expensive giving the lack of facilities on offer.

It's within walking distance of Rockafeller, Empire State, Times Square etc.Check in was quick and easy. We arrived at around 9pm so there were no queues. Walking past reception in the morning and afternoon looked busy most of the time but I think there are enough staff to help so you don't wait too long.We're were told on arrival (and there were notes everywhere) explaining there was an issue with breakfast but we would be compensated. For every day breakfast was unavailable we would get $25 per person. For our 2 days of no breakfast we were given $100 there and then in cash which was great because we hadn't budgeted for an extra meal. When breakfast was available it was OK, everything you'd expect from a buffet - toast, cereal, cold meats and cheese, pastries, fruit, sausage, bacon, hot & cold drinks.The room itself was great. When you visit New York for pleasure you don't spend any unnecessary time in the room. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great and you got shampoos etc. The only ""problem"" with the shower was it took a while to get hot but I wouldn't complain about something like that. The WiFi was great, could use it on upto 4 devices.There's is a safe in the room with a number pad so all your stuff is safe. This is refreshing as in European hotels not only do you have to pay to use the room safe but it's usually managed with a key, which I don't trust is safe.There's was enough drawer and cupboard space to put our clothes in. There's an iron and ironing board, which we didn't use so can't comment on the quality. There is a hairdryer fixed to the wall.The curtains were good and blacked out all the lights from Times Square (we were on the 24th floor with a view of Times Square). There was a lot of street noise but that didn't bother us - we're in New York, it's expected. We couldn't hear any noise from other rooms. There is a small fridge with nothing but complimentary bottled water (ie no minibar).The only issue with the room is that there is a plug socket right near the window by a table and chair, but there's no mirror there (I have hair straighteners and would have liked to have done my hair there) but there is a socket in the bathroom. There are also USB ports by the bed so you can charge your devices.We're loved our stay here and if we wanted to stay near Times Square we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","Southampton, United Kingdom","Bandy_Worldabili</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

We stayed in 1601 and had a view out the back of the hotel and was a double deluxe.Sadly the room was the big let down of the hotel, heater/air con was pointless room was regularly between 24-28 degrees, opening window helped cool it but wasn’t practical. Bathroom was very big although only had a shower, a bath would have easily fit but I guess they were going for modern feel.Breakfast was part of the package however at check in was informed it wasn’t available at present due to a ‘technical error’ - as part of this we were offered $25pp/per day when it wasn’t available which eased the blow. This was only the case for 3 days and when it was back on breakfast was really good and recommended.Overall the hotel is ok but seems to still be finding its feet still, given time It can only get better... my recommendations are:Fix AC - make sure rooms are comfyFamily’s - if family’s are staying make sure they’re aware of what’s available.

New York is of course the city that never sleeps and we can vouch for that as all hours of the night there are cars beeping, alarms going off and people shouting.

We were a group of four (two couples in two rooms). This us not the cheapest hotel we've stayed in so my expectations were quite high.The location is truly fantastic, one block from Times Square. We had breakfast included and we all enjoyed the offerings - cereal, cooked, pastries, cold meats and cheese, juice and hot drinks. Very good breakfast but there is a queue for the dining room. It moves quickly at least but you are quite jammed in when you get in there. The rooms are small but I can't say this bothered us too much. The frosted glass wall between the shower and bedroom was a strange design choice. Absolutely fine when staying as a couple but causes problems when one of you wants to use the bathroom at night because you can't help but wake the other. We also hated the sliding glass door as the gap means you can see the other person on the toilet. You can't control the temperature in the room so the first night we were unbearably hot (it hit something like 35degreesC). If you open the window, you can't sleep because it is so noisy outside (not the hotels fault). The thermostat is completely pointless and I've never known a hotel where you can't turn on the AC in your room. We got round this by leaving the window open all day when we went out and closing at night. I wouldn't say the room decor is my favourite - it is quite cold and almost clinical. I personally didn't find the bed all that comfortable but my Husband had no complaints. The fire alarm went off one morning with overhead announcements telling us it was a false alarm and one half of the breakfast dining area flooded another day.

Four nights in February our first family trip to New York.We found staff fairly friendly but the facilities lacking.Breakfast was an important part of why we booked this hotel - one easy meal that the children would fill up on.We didn't expect to spend a lot of time on our first morning in New York having to find somewhere for breakfast because the facility was inexplicably closed. It was much easier once we'd found our feet but on our first day with no direction except queue after midday and we'll compensate you on a daily basis.The waver the hotel asked us to sign was bizarre and I did ask to amend it to specify the £25 compensation was specifically for the lack of breakfast and not every eventuality as was worded.The deluxe king twin room, on 19th floor, I stayed in with our 7 year old daughter was 27+ degrees at night. Several trips to reception, over two days, and a phone call resulted in an engineer visiting and saying that the heating was fine and they don't have air conditioning working in winter. Opening the window did bring the temperature down to about 24 at best, but it was incredibly noisy with sirens 24/ 7 so a complex game of be too hot to sleep or it be too loud. The other room we had as a family on the 19th floor was a far more even temperature around 22 degrees. I found it frustrating to have to find somewhere to eat and have to wait around for an engineer. These are not things you expect to do on holiday.The rooms ensuite had a glass wall which formed the back wall of the shower. This ment during the night if anyone went to the loo and turned the light on the whole room bedroom lit up. Could really do with a curtain.The staff were generally friendly but this didn't compensate for lack of facilities. On the penultimate morning we wanted to find the concierge to arrange transport back to the airport but they weren't to be found. We asked at reception but they directed us back to the not to be found concierge. Later in the day I went back to a receptionist and they did help me call a firm i'd found online - so it was a bit hit and miss with help depending on who was on the desk.On check out we left bags with staff in the bag room. We were a little shocked on our return to find the reception a couple of hours later to find the area littered with suitcases in a completely unsecure manner., just posts and tape around them. It took quite a while to find someone to find our bags and quite a while for our bags to be found.A bit too hit and miss for a large chain 4* hotel.We booked a package through British Airways and will be feeding back that we really feel this isn't brand standard.

I usually like to get breakfast included but this was unavailable for some of our stay so we sampled eating both in and out of the hotel. I would advise on saving some money and finding breakfast in one of the many local excellent bakeries and cafes who also do really good coffee (Amy’s bread, & along edge of Bryant Park) and will save you $25 dollars between two of you (rather than 50 for 2 at hotel) I guess this would apply to many of the hotels ","Chester, United Kingdom","Bobert_rc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chester, United Kingdom</strong>",1,4.0

Taxi from JFK cost around $70 including tip. Arrived to be greeted by the lovely doorman who showed us inside and directed us to reception. Booking in was very easy, paid $100 on my credit card which was held until I checked out, the cost charged was facility fee of around $70. Room was spacious, clean and we had a great view from room 1411. Shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair dryer, iron, ironing board and safe were all included in the room. There is also a large tv with many channels to choose from should you have tone to turn it on! Staff were helpful throughout the stay and housekeeping left me a little message each day thanking me for their tip. Breakfast was included with the cost of the hotel, a great variety, from cereal to cooked breakfast, pastries to fresh fruit. The grab and go option was great also for those with a busy itinerary that couldn’t wait around to eat. The queue for breakfast was long each morning unless you timed it well (0700-0730 hrs no line to wait in but after that until around 0900 hrs was very busy)however the staff were very efficient and got you seated as quickly as they could. I think the longest we waited in line was around 15 minutes. The location of the hotel was perfect, turn left out of the hotel and keep walking for around 5 minutes and you find yourself in the heart of Times Square. You are in the middle of theatre district with some great shows only a few minutes walk away from Hamilton (if you are lucky enough to be able to get tickets!) to Kinky Boots to Frozen! There’s something for everyone. You have a variety of restaurants and bars in your doorstep as well as shops, there’s even a Carlo’s Cake Shop down the road from the famous Cake Boss show! A must to visit if you love cake! All in all a great hotel to stay at when visiting New York. We only encountered one issue during the stay and that was on our last day when a burst water pipe meant that breakfast was cancelled, however we were reimbursed for this and because there are so many restaurants in the area you could easily pick up breakfast elsewhere. To get around the city I’d recommend Top View bus hopper, there are reps outside the hotel who can sell you tickets, we got 3 days for the price of 2 so do haggle with the reps! $29 for 1 day and $59 for 2, we got 3 days for this price. The downtown bus leaves from across the hotel each day from 0800 hrs and the uptown tour bus stop is just up the street! With the 2 day ticket you get free ticket to NY City Museum, a night time tour (this isn’t a hop on hop off but a must do even just to see the beautiful Manhattan skyline at night), a bronx tour and a Brooklyn tour as well as a boat ride around the Statue of Liberty!

We emailed ahead as it was a special occasion for the in-laws and the hotel provided a few nice touches in the room which was hugely appreciated and kicked off their first stay in NYC perfectly.The check in was great, really helpful and very professional.The room we were allocated on 23rd floor was compact, far smaller than we had previously experienced in NYC, but we are only there to sleep so how much room do you really need. The issue with the room was not the size it was the unbearable heat! No matter what we did we could not get the heat down so we had to resort to having the window open which, of course, just meant that we were subjected to the non-stop sirens and noises that accompany life in NYC. We asked the reception about air con and they just said it wasn't available! So essentially we did not sleep for the 5 nights of our stay. This was further impacted by the incident remarked on in an earlier post - alarm goes off at stupid o'clock followed by several tannoy instructions advising us that this is possibly a false alarm followed by no follow up message to say that it was safe!Like most of the people staying here at this time, we were on a B&B basis and for three of our five nights this was absolutely fine - in fact the breakfast was excellent. Always a queue but the standard of the produce was worth waiting for.Until the 4th day when we were greeted by signs in the lifts to say that due to a technical incident they would be unable to provide breakfast but that if we went to reception after 1200 that day we would be given $25 per person per day. There were lots of people queuing at reception to complain, but these things happen.We were told by one member of staff it was electrical and another it was water and then by a duty manager that the hotel had taken the steps to stop offering breakfasts due to health and safety, but then we went outside to find that they had a bright yellow notice attached to the restaurant door saying that the facility had been closed by order of the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene!When we went back later to collect our compensation, we were met with a rather surly and aggressive operative from behind the counter who said that we wouldn't be getting any compensation until check out. This was despite the notices from earlier that were actually still all over the hotel. I complained and asked to speak to the manager and it was agreed that we would get our compensation LESS the resort fee for the whole of our stay!Furthermore we were told that we would only get the compensation if we signed an indemnity to say that we would not be able to make further claim on the hotel. This is fine but indemnity against what issue - water/electrical or the hygiene notice posted at the front of the hotel?? So we signed, but caveated it to reflect what we had been told by the hotel.All in all found this hotel and its management to be disingenuous and untrustworthy, all fur coat and no undergarments. Problems happen, but it is how you deal, communicate and resolve the issues that marks the class of an establishment and they showed no class at all.There are far too many good hotels out there to waste your money here.","York, United Kingdom","Herfie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>York, United Kingdom</strong>",89,2.0

Our room was on the 25th floor with a view. The view is quite nice considering the hotel’s location is so close to Times Square. One slight criticism we have is that it was difficult to control the temperature of our room as it was quite warm even for the dead of winter. It still wasn’t a big enough issue to bring to the staff’s attention but it was certainly noticeable. Ultimately, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an enjoyable, and convenient stay near Times Square.

New York is very expensive for drinks around $15 for a cocktail so it was a nice surprise to find the bar has happy hour all night every night with classic cocktails and wine at $7 - $8.We also had a meal in the restaurant which was very very nice and busy with a good atmosphere.At the end of our stay as we were leaving for the airport we asked the concierge if he could get us a cab, he asked us to wait for a moment and got us one of the hotel's new black Escalades a flat fee of $75 to JFK only slightly more that a grubby yellow cab!Thoroughly recommend Riu Plaza.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","MrManor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",69,5.0

The second night was exactly the same and when an engineer did eventually turn up, all he could suggest was that we open the window. Third night it was all fixed, as if it was by magic.The third night had some other issues, a fire alarm went off at 05:30am and continued for at least 20 minutes. Over the tannoy we were advised to stay in our room which we did for the next 30 minutes. At no point did the hotel let us know that it was ok to resume normal action or give us an update of the situation which I thought was abit naughty.Finally, on day 2 (after specifically choosing this hotel as it included breakfast and paying extra for breakfast) we were informed that there was an issue in the kitchen with the pipes and they would not be serving breakfast for the rest of our stay. They compensated by giving us a refund of $25pp per day however, as future holidaymakers heading to times square will quickly realize - breakfast at times square comes to more then $25 pp as it is a very expensive city.Overall, if RIU PLAZA can sort out the thermostat issue and compensate better for the breakfast issues this would be a great hotel but in my honest opinion, with the issues above this can only be rated as 'average'.","Essex, United Kingdom","DonDunlop</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Essex, United Kingdom</strong>",22,3.0

They made it right by moving us into another junior suite this morning with an actual city view that also has a broken thermostat and it is 85 degrees and we are sweating so much, but they can’t even bring us cold waters and an ice bucket that they promised an hour ago. The engineer as well as several front desk staff told us they know about this issue. So in words, this hotel is okay lying to their guests and hoping they either don’t notice or complain. I’m waiting to talk to the manager tomorrow and the general manager is not here to rectify this situation immediately. But we want our money back in full that they charged my credit card long before we came to stay here, so we can stay the rest of our trip at another hotel that actually takes care of their guests and doesn’t trick them into staying here knowing all the issues it has. They should let guests know and let them decide whether they want to stay here or not given these problems. I, for one, would’ve stayed at another hotel from the beginning. There are many more issues here as well, but I’m tired of filling out forms and dealing with customer service. I’m just giving a heads up to future travelers, don’t stay here!!

I originally thought this was a nice hotel at a good location until the following happened. My sister and her husband came to NYC from Munich, Germany for the first time to celebrate my sister's birthday 2 weeks ago. I decided to fly up from Austin, TX, where I live and meet with them. We booked 2 separate rooms at the hotel. When we arrived at about 1 PM on January 9th, only their room was ready, which was a little disappointing for me, but I decided to leave my luggage at my sister's room while we went sightseeing. Before we left, I asked to use the bathroom. THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE!!!!! When I shut the door using the sliding glass door, the door slammed against my middle finger, severely hurting it. Note that I just gently slid the door shut. I pulled my finger out and said ""Ouch"" and suddenly the glass inside the door, made some weird crackling sounds, which scared us a lot. Note that I'm not a big person by any means and did not exert any force on the door. I simply wanted to close it to have some privacy. It was weird because they had put some kind of stopper on the door, which didn't really lined up, so needless to say it was some bad engineering on their part. We were pretty shocked and I called the reception and told them about our accident, asking for a new room. Soon, a couple of people came up to the 7th floor, looked at the damage and agreed that we would need a new room. I told them that I felt that the sliding door wasn't working properly and everybody made us believe that this was in no way our fault and that we would get a new room ASAP. It still took quite a while until we both had a new room, but we resumed with our sightseeing thinking that everything would be OK. We had a wonderful time in NYC and I left 2 days later feeling really great about the trip, the city, and the hotel. My sister and her husband checked out a day later. When they checked out, they were presented with a random bill for $1800. Somebody brought a German-speaking person who explaining that the damage to the door was their fault and that engineering had examined the cause. My sister and her husband (both are MDs and very smart people, but English isn't their first language) were very stunned. They only had 5 hours until their plane left and they were told they couldn't leave until they were paid up. They were never even presented with a real bill that broke down the cost, but just some random makeshift notice that they had to pay. They finally negotiated the cost down to $1000, but needless to say, this spoiled their entire trip and NYC experience. If I had been there, this wouldn't have happened, because I would not have let that happen. I've been to many hotel chains in the US, like the Westin or the W. Last time I was in NYC, I stayed at the W, and I assured my sister and her husband that those hotels would never ever charge their customers for any hazardous conditions that are their fault and not ours!!!! I pinched my finger by closing a malfunctioning door, and now my sister gets charged for this. This is so outrageous. I cannot believe that this so-called family hotel chain takes advantage of their overseas customers like this and spoils their entire experience instead of offering an apology for creating a hazardous condition to begin with. I will make sure to post this in all my social networks and tell my business associates as well that they shall never visit this hotel again. SHAME ON YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!",,Constanze K,10,1.0

I specifically booked a Deluxe Double room so that we could have two double beds seeing that I was traveling with my son. Upon arrival, the staff behind the desk was rude, and dismissive. After being assigned the room for our three night stay, I inquired if it was for sure a room with two double beds as stated on my confirmation. I was rudely told that it was a room with a king bed because we reserved a room for two adults. I politely replied that we were two adults, but not every pair of adults staying at the hotel would not use a king bed and this was my son, and I specifically reserved two double beds. I was told that if I wanted two double beds, I would have to pay extra money. I showed the confirmation of my reservation again, and was told rudely that I booked a king bed. I disagreed and asked to speak to a manager. The employee retreated to a back room and after waiting for about five minutes in which she obviously briefed the manager, the manager approached me and argued that the booking company I used booked a king bed even though my confirmation clearly showed a Double Deluxe room. My choices were to either sleep in the same bed with my 19 year old son in a king bed, or pay extra and sleep one night in a room with two double beds, but I would need to move the next day to a room with a king bed. I then showed a picture of the Double Deluxe room from the Riu website showing two double beds, and the manager continued to argue that it was my booking agent and if I wanted to I could call them. He then brusquely walked away. Left with no choice, I took the room with two double beds and the notion that I would have to pay extra. The next morning, I was called by the front desk and told that, ""If I really wanted to move to a room with king bed, I would need to do it now!"" I politely explained that I did not want to move to room with a king bed, and was very happy with the room with the two double beds which is what I booked. She then argued with me that I was the one who asked to move. I explained once again the situation I was in and that I was traveling with my 19 year old son and clearly wanted a room with two double beds. She told me she would have to get back to me. ???? Fifteen minutes later I was told I could stay in my current room for the remainder of our stay. When I checked out , I was handed a bill for over $100.00 which I was ""up-charged"" for the room I had originally reserved. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! The staff is rude, unreasonable, and the antithesis of the term ""customer service."" The room we were given was modern, had a gorgeous view, and was bright. However, there was black curly hair on the bathroom floor, and in the shower. We could not figure out the thermostat and the room was rather warm. We slept with the window cracked open and we stayed in January. The breakfast was a nice touch, but was very cramped, and again the service was rude, and indifferent.

The staff are largely, with some exceptions, friendly and do their best to help.Now the negatives, which largely concern service.1. They charge a daily service fee, which for us staying 4 days was about $52. I don’t actually have a problem with this. It is made very clear on their web site. BUT, if they are going to charge it, they should deliver the service. The service charge is meant to cover 2 bottles of water in the room every other day. When we arrived, there was no water and the safe was also locked. I went down to reception. They gave me water and promised that they would send someone up to open the safe. No one arrived. When we went out that evening we had to take all our valuables. As I left I reminded them about the safe. Again, they said they would send someone up immediately but when we’re returned it was still locked. Only at the 3rd time of asking did the safe get opened.2. On our last full day the room wasn’t made up at all, even though we were out all day apart from 45 minutes at lunch time. When we got back at 5pm the room hadn’t been made up. As we were going out again that evening I decided to tell them as we left. Reception promised they would send someone up straight away. We were going out to see the Christmas decorations so got back about 9:30pm. The room still hadn’t been cleaned. At that stage we were tired and leaving the next day so we really couldn’t be bothered to complain again.3. They have a bar but it is so small that there not enough seats. Twice we went for a drink but couldn’t get a seat so we left. Of course, there are loads of bars nearby but after walking miles around New York we just wanted a drink and a sit down in the most convenient location. You can get a drink in the room mainly used for breakfast on the other side of the lobby but it doesn’t have the same atmosphere as a bar.4. I’ve stayed in loads of hotels around the world. I’m usually asked if I enjoyed the stay. The person who checked us out seemed completely indifferent to our experience, which was a shame.In summary, it’s great location so I wouldn’t want to put you off staying here and maybe we were just unlucky but, from our experience, they could do with improving the service.",Epsom,"THFC1882Epsom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Epsom</strong>",30,4.0

Altogether a really good choice of hotel, we could not have asked for better. The location is brilliant, right in the heart of Times Square, we walked everywhere. We bought a New York Explorer pass in England for £59 which covered 3 excursions (£48 for kids). We decided to do a Riverboat Cruise on the Hudson River, the Rockafella Centre to view New York from the observatory at the top and the American Natural History Museum. From the Museum we walked across the road to Central Park and enjoyed walking through the park in crunchy snow. The younger members went ice skating and then we walked back to 46th street to the hotel. Breakfast was Included in our booking and it was superb, just about everything you could want and loads of it. We happened to visit New York during the 2nd coldest New Year since 1917 but it was sunny and bright and we wrapped up well (including our faces). In spite of the cold we did everything on our list including luckily a horse and carriage ride through Central Park on our last day (the horses had not been allowed out because of the severe cold weather).

This is not what you would expect, even from a 3-4 star hotel. Rooms not cleaned, if you call they promise to clean but never show up and need to call again for dry towels. Cleaners don’t even check that toiletpaper is almost finished when cleaning. Not friendly at check in/check out, bagageroom etc. A general attitude of not caring. perhaps they don’t expect tourist guests to ever come back.

Spotlessly clean, the lobby smells wonderful every time you walk in, bright and very contemporary.We stayed in a family deluxe suite on the 17th floor with a great view. The room was clean and tidy and an ok size, however would of been better if it was wider. We found it strange there wasn’t a mirror over the dressing table so struggled with 2 women doing their hair and make up when getting ready.The Bathroom was lovely but not very large. I had previously read comments about the glass wall in the shower and did worry about this, however I needn’t of as it’s not as bad as I imagined.We had breakfast included which was great. All the food was fresh and again the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The only fault I could pick was that the food at breakfast in the 8th Avenue restaurant was always cold by the time we got back to our table which was not appetising, but we never experienced this in the smaller restaurant in the lobby, food was always hot there. The Staff, hmm I’ll be honest I was not impressed. On check in there was a problem with the name our booking for some reason, fromWhat I could make out. I produced my accommodation pre paid voucher from BA to 2 members of staff and I asked if there is a problem and I was ignored. They carried on talking to each other in what seemed to be Brazilian or a similar language, so I asked again and was ignored again by them both. After a couple of mins they seemed to of sorted the mix up out and amended the name, I was handed 4 door entry cards and told we were on the 17th floor. He took our details from our passports and handed them back to me and walked off. We were left there thinking is that it? Can we go? So I waited to ask a lady that was also behind the counter who was sorting paperwork out. We waited and waited she definitely saw us but completely ignored us and walked off. So we left and went up to our room. The next morning my husband went down to the desk to ask a question and was waiting in line and was completely ignored and so was another guest waiting. A lady with a baby asked a female member of staff for a baby changing area and she was ignored, In fact the lady actually called out to her again and walked after her and asked the question again to be Snapped at with “No!”.

As we were staying for a week we decided to upgrade to a room with 2 beds. We paid for the upgrade. First night we found that the window was broken and kept opening allowing gusts of winds to blow in. This proved to be a difficult night as it was -12 degrees outside.We requested a room change at 6am the following morning which they agreed to at 3pm. The rooms are on the basic side but are clean.The breakfast was a big bonus. If you are up at 6:30am we could eat in the main restaurant other than that it was a canteen style room. Hot and cold breakfast was available with a good choice of drinks.The reception staff were rude and unhelpful. They did not know what they were doing and needed help from other members of staff. There was no structure to the staffing with the bell boys doing as they pleased be it pacing the front of the hotel or sat slouched their side of reception. Again they were very unhelpful regarding transport from the hotel saying yellow cabs would not be available due to traffic and the holidays however it seemed $20 speeded the process up. We booked with Tui and this included free transfers to and from the airport. It's free for a reason. It took over three hours to get from bag claim to the hotel. We had to wait for the driver to arrive to take us to the hotel. there were 8 people in the mini bus with us . The driver kept insisting there were in 6 in the mini bus and was waiting for 2 more people even though 8 people were sat for over an hour trying to convince him we were all there. It felt like a Peter Kay comedy sketch. Finally setting off the driver got lost 3 times and struggled with google maps.The return journey was equally mad due to the fact that the driver arrived at the hotel and left without any passengers. After speaking to the volatour Rep at the hotel she telephoned the driver and he came back.Nothing is free, we have been to New York before and have never experienced such a tragic package deal.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Walshnyc2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",2,1.0

There is no carpet in the room. The bathroom fixtures are quite contemporary and there was a nice closet area with an in-room safe. The bed was very comfortable, and I'm pretty picky. The biggest complaint about the room was that the water pressure was very gentle. We were only there one night so I didn't need to shampoo my hair, but I think I might still be there rinsing if I did. The Hotel: the breakfast had a large buffet but noting was particularly special on it. Everything looked very warmed over. We did not eat there. The worst and most unexpected part was check in. We had a prepaid room. But both room guests had to show ID and then the hotel photocopied the ID. Then we had to leave a security deposit on the room...not just run the credit card in case, but an actual amount that is then lifted when you check out. There is no bill under your door at the end, so you really want to check out in person to verify charges which adds to the process. Oh, and beware the 'resort fee' that you are required to pay. It's in the fine print.Because of the weird check in, the poor breakfast, and the low shower flow, we give a 4, though perhaps it should be a 3....","Bethesda, Maryland","skormama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethesda, Maryland</strong>",75,4.0

For the price of staying here this could have been included or at least sold cheaply on the premises.However the breakfast was lovely, a great choice of cereals,cheese,cold meat,,smoked salmon,Danish pastries and so on.

The Riu always does a great job of taking care of there guests. This Hotel lives uo the reputation of the chain. For an inner city Hotel the room was ready upon arrival.

The breakfasts at this RIU had everything you could desire.There was an on suite for gusts of the higher floors. Complimentary wine and beverages, in this area. The fridge in the on suite open to guests from floor 26th floor and up was a great touch. Wine, Muffins, and Candies a great little area to relax and get to meet other guests.Needles to say this Hotel is a block or two a way from the main Times Square area. First time visitors to New York will need to get to know there way around. This Hotel really is in a triple a location. Don't rent a car, take the subway of just start walking.Times Square is one of the most cosmopolitan areas there are. Shows, restraunts, night life and not far from Central Park. This is a must see. The RIU is well prices for the area and gives great comfort to its guests.The perks of staying in a Central area for the first time visitor is well work a few extra dollars. You can begin to discover New York City from the inside out.

Hotel is very modern. The staff are incredibly nice and friendly. Room was very clean. I am very picky about where I stay and it was my first time staying here so here are the Pros: breakfast buffet is included which was great, hotel is located on Restaurant Row so there are plenty of good places to eat going away from Times Square, there was a food truck right outside the door which had great hot dogs, plenty of places to shop for souvenirs, walking distance from theater district, we walked to Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center without being tired at all, location is excellent. The Cons would actually make me not book this hotel again. I would have to see the situation I would be in to consider it or not. 1) the glass shower stall is not private at all. You could clearly see the person taking a shower in his/her full glory. The stall has a white tint to it which DID NOT hide much. Traveling with a teenager who was not pleased at all, we had to turn off the lights while showering or give our backs to the person in the stall so we wouldnt see anything. The same goes for the toilet. Once the door was slid closed, there was a huge crack and if you sat at the desk, or by the foot of the beds, you could see the person sitting on the toilet doing their business. I complained to the front desk and they did say they were aware of the privacy issue. I am sure they could add a blind to the outside glass. 2) I had two double beds and they were pushed together. I was obviously the person who somehow would end up in the middle and had to crawl my way into and out of the bed.

Only reason not 5 star is we encountered a lot of pressure from the concierge man to use ‘the hotels car’ to get to the airport going home. They lied about the yellow cabs saying they charge on the meter which is not true as there is a set fare for airport. They lied about how much we would be charged. They also kept saying there is no way we will be able to hail a cab but we did within minutes after they left us alone. Made us very uncomfortable. Once in the taxi the driver said “the hotels use their friends and get kick backs, it’s normal for them to pressure you” Other than the concierge man and his friend’s lies which let the hotel down, it was amazing an stay and I would recommend.

Bus stops right opposite for city sightseeing. Our room was a twin on the 24th floor, view out was south and very impressive, we heard little noise. It was compact but more than adequate, modern and clean. We would have liked a coffee maker as travelling from the uk we are always awake about 4am with jet lag, however we did use the lounge on the 26th floor for coffee. We had breakfast each morning and this was great, plenty of choice and even though hotel was very busy we got seated no problem, this saved us quite a bit in spending money! We ate dinner a couple of times in the hotel and food was good and reasonably priced, we also had drinks in the Fashion bar and again were a good price for Manhattan. We found all staff polite, we had a couple of issues with our keys but most probably because they were beside our phones in our bag but this was fixed promptly each time. We took advantage of the late check out which was very helpful as out flight was in the evening. All in all a great base to explore New York and we would definitely stay again if visiting again.

Lots to choose from at breakfast: cooked breakfast, continental, fruit, breads and pastries so you can fill up for the day. If you haven’t booked breakfast it’s $19 per person. You can ask for late check out if your flight is later, but tip is to ask when you checkin as if it’s full they won’t extend, it’s first come first served. They charge $30 to extend to 3pm and then an hourly rate after that IF they can accommodate, but there’s a big storage area to leave bags.Hotel is new and modern, rooms have fridge but no coffee/tea facilities. Hairdryer in the bathroom, electronic safe and iron and ironing board. Bathroom just has a glass sliding door - seems to be a bit of a gap and doesn’t block out noise!

Ok there was a little noise we were on the 9th floor so I’m guessing it might have been the lower levels maybe? 2 mins from Times Square so fabulous location meaning plenty of restaurants and plenty to do. The hotel is close to all of the tourist sightseeing spots. We walked to them all even though we’d purchased a 7 day pass for bus and the subway. We had bed and breakfast at the hotel and there was plenty of options. I would recommend the fashion restaurant as it was quieter because it’s much smaller. We got the LIIR shuttle from JFK and then the subway to 42nd st port authority was a 5 min walk to hotel from here so perfect and cheap as chips. It was daytime so was fine but I wouldn’t recommend doing at 5.30am like we did as it was quite scary lots of not so nice people hanging around and didn’t feel safe. We had some great shopping days in century 21 grabbing some amazing bargains and also Macy’s had a great sale too but make sure you plan a day to go to there as Macy’s has 11 floors!!!

He noticed my haitian 1804 t-shirt and began chatting with me. I appreciated the staff quick table clean up once they noticed guests were done. Your coffee machine is super awesome.

When me and my wife arrived, things were ok until we found out only one of us could eat breakfast. Really? While checking in, the clerk informed us that breakfast was for one only. I complained and asked for the manager. He went to a back room and returned a few minutes later. He said the manager would give me 10% off the breakfast. Really? It got worse. We got to our room #2213. It was the size of a toilet.....I take that back. The actual toilet was bigger than the room. The dumb clerk gave us a handicapped room. It had a push button knob by the door. The bell clerk showed us how it works and guess what? It didn't work. The view from the room was spectacular but don't turn around. You're in a small closet again. We knew we couldn't stay there 8 days so we called the front desk. They said we had to pay for 8 days regardless if we stayed there or not. They told to call Expedia who we made the reservation and speak with them. We called Expedia the next morning who said that we would have to handle this through RIU. This went back and forth for three hours until I told my wife to write down everyone's first and last name and position. People started getting nervous. I won't waste your time with names of the riu manager, clerks, reservation person at Expedia and the their manager. But we begin to get through to somebody because RIU said we no longer have to pay for the remaining stay. Dah!We left the next morning heading to the Hotel Edison.

We got both, but after walking past the Riu Plaza and taking a look inside, we quickly changed our plans and checked out of the Doubletree after one night, and stayed the second two nights here.First off, the location of this hotel can't be beat. You are literally a block from Times Square but a million miles away from the riff raff. Forget about the tourists, you are heckled every step of your way through Times Square by bus tour peddlers, would-be rappers trying to ""give"" you their CDs, and characters dressed in costumes attempting to con you into taking a picture with them. It's too much for anybody, any age.So, a block away (7th is a primary arterial street through Times Square) on 8th Street, literally across the street from at least 10 theaters, you can pay the same price to stay at this brand new, hip, clean hotel with plenty of modern amenities.The breakfast buffet is excellent - plenty of options to choose from and plenty of seating capacity. We showed up both mornings around 9:30 and had no problem getting a seat either day.The lobby is a great place to hang. It has a really distinct, fresh smell, similar to some of the nicer hotels in Las Vegas but without the cigarette smoke. We spent at least a few hours at various points just sitting and chilling out in the lobby, watching people.Riu is an international company and this and their property in Miami are their only US hotels, and it shows. There was a distinctly international feel and I say that in a good way.About the rooms - they are small, but very modern, very sleek, and really all you need. The views from any side of the hotel are outstanding - facing west, you look over Hell's Kitchen and the Hudson River. Facing East, you look towards Times Square and can see plenty of theaters and lights. The busy 8th street below is also fun to watch.Beds are comfortable. About 100 tv stations to choose from. Shower worked great and the water was quite warm.I'm not sure how long prices will stay as they are here, so take advantage while you can! We will definitely choose this hotel again as the location provided for a great alternative to Mid-town, if you want to be up closer to the Theater District.","Mercer Island, Washington","scottw415</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mercer Island, Washington</strong>",6,5.0

The hotel looked lovely from the lobby but the rooms weren’t as nice as I thought they would be, the corridor looked like student accommodation which was very simple. The room itself was ok, a bit on the small side but as we only really needed it to sleep in it did us. The one thing that did stand out in the room was the glass that was a partition between the room and the shower, when someone got up to go to the toilet in the night it lit up the whole room and also you could see the other person in the shower which was ok for us but if you are with a friend it wouldn’t be so nice! The hotel staff weren’t overly friendly when approached. As I said it was my boyfriends 30th birthday and I asked if we could order a cake for him as a surprise I was told “we don’t do cakes but if he has handed in his passport at check in then we will know and a card and chocolates will be delivered to your room”. Well it came to Wednesday which was his birthday and nothing!! I feel like they can’t really be bothered to do anything out of their way to make it a memorable stay for guests.

When we checked in we were charged a “facility fee” for the use of their gym and lounges to which we objected. However it turned out this was the compulsory tourism tax which everybody has to pay so why did they refer to it as a facility fee for the hotel? Next morning we battled down for breakfast along with the hordes and were shown to a table, given a place mat and left to queue for coffee, bread, cheese, ham and fruit. The queuing took ages and the noise was incredible, but the quality of the food was good and everything was spotless. On our way back to the bedroom on the 26 th floor we spotted a little lounge which we could open with our key card so from then on we breakfasted in that lounge where there were tubs of fresh fruit salad, croissants, ham and cheese plus jugs of hot coffee, tea and water. Apparently we had been given an upgrade to the 26 th floor and this lounge was part of the deal. I would say the upgrade was essential to our stay in the hotel and made all the difference. If you can afford it go for it! The position of the hotel is near enough Times Square to be readily accessible a couple of minutes away and all the city bus tours start a block away, but far enough away to be quieter and miss most of the traffic noise. The advantage for hotel Riu is location and the fact that breakfast is included which for NY is unusual, rooms are small but clean and there is an outdoor patio with seating area plus I believe a gym which I managed to avoid.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","whitesheilagh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",148,4.0

The hotel was very convenient with Times Square just a block away, right on Restaurant Row and the Theater district. We are very familiar with the RIU brand and this location was much the same. Check-in was fast and efficient. We arrived at 10 AM, stored our bags and were told a room should be ready by 12:30, much before the advertised check-in time of 3 PM. We walked around the area and returned about 12:30 to be told our room was ready and our bags would be delivered. That was especially nice since had been touring the Northeast states for 8 days, lugging around 4 bags to different hotels each day. We had a beautiful room on the 19th floor with a corner location so we had views to the East toward Times Square and the South toward Midtown and the Lower Manhattan. The room was very quiet, bed firm and comfortable and everything functioned as specified. We did not sample the breakfast buffet since we took advantage of a special RIU Class offer that didn't include that, but there are plenty of places close by to get a quick breakfast. And we were able to walk less than a block all 3 nights to great restaurants right on 46th between 7th and 8th.

The bed was very good as was the blackout curtains etc making for a good night's sleep. The bathroom was a good size with a good walk in shower but it does have a frosted glass wall and so you can see a shadow of whoever is in the shower which could be embarrassing for some but we were OK. The bathroom also has a sliding door which is good for going to the loo in the night, but it does not lock/click, so useful to know in advance.The room itself was a good size for New York, and relativity quiet for sleeping given its location but I used ear plugs as you can still hear sirens/car horns etc even on the 26th floor - think a river facing room would be quieter than one on 46th ST or 8th AVE. The views were also good of Times Square (of overlooking 8th street) and of the Hudson River is located on the opposite side of the hotel. It's good to get a room on a higher floor to get the better views and to get in the lift, if you're on a much lower floor the lift is often full by the time it gets there, so you have to wait longer. On arrival after a very long day/flight, the receptionist was not at all welcoming, not even 'hello' which we found rude as was her manner when we were signing in - luckily most of the other staff were far friendlier.We had been upgraded and so got a slightly larger room, which was good as most of the space is taken up by the very large beds, and so there's little drawer space. Luckily I'd read a previous review, and so took extra clothes hangers - which were welcome as we got about 6 each otherwise. Also the room did not have coffee/tea facilities, so we took a travel kettle, which could run on 240 and it did, but a lot slower than when used in the UK. There is a fridge, which is empty apart from water, as it's for cooling your drinks etc, (it's not a mini bar) but it's not got a freezer section and there's no ice machines on the floors, which is very strange for an American hotel. The space was fine for our holiday but the 'desk' would have been small if there for work.The queues for breakfast were long and so we went out to local diners for breakfast.","Lake District, United Kingdom","Tr1pper49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake District, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

We had our window open on the first night and yes we did here the tooting of horns and vehicles etc but after that we had the window shut and the turned on to keep the room cool enough problem solved.Room was perfect for the both of us it was the double and we still had enough room with shopping we had bought, we didn't find the frosted glass between the shower and our room a problem you could tell someone was using it but that's about it.Breakfast was great, we ate he twice and ate out twice which was part of our experience.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not what we expected. The breakfast has a European flair (aside from being only average tasting) and the rooms are very small. Said rooms also include a semi-transparent shower, so don't get a room with people you aren't very comfortable with.In regards to the service, they appear greatly understaffed and were not consistently prompt with satisfying our needs. For one, we had a plumbing issue in our bathroom one morning as we were trying to get ready to go out for the day. We used the room phone to call the front desk, and after explaining the issue twice, were told a maintenance person was coming. Nearly 15 minutes later, having seen no such individual, we called a second time to reiterate the urgency that we could not use the bathroom precisely when we need to. A maintenance man arrived shortly after and fixed the problem.The subsequent day, when we wanted to check out, we again experienced service difficulties. We were told to dial 0 for the valet to ask for our car. This did not work, so we called the front desk and also asked for a porter to bring a cart to our room and help with our bags. Almost 20 minutes later, no porter, so we arduously gathered all of our belongings by ourselves and went downstairs. Once downstairs, we learned that our car wasn't exactly ""on it's way,"" so we spoke with the valet and asked them to get the car, which arrived nearly 45 minutes later. We originally called downstairs at 10:30 in an attempt to be on the road at 11. Thanks to the service, we left the hotel closer to noon.Having said all of this, I would like to highlight some examples of exceptional service. Two members of the valet team, Carlos and Edwin, exhibited what I expect in a luxury hotel. Upon checking in, Carlos came out to our car with a cart, helped us unload all of our bags, had someone take the car for us, took our bags upstairs, and helped us unload them all within 10 minutes. On top of that, he was exceptionally friendly and professional. The next day, when the hotel experienced an emergency maintenance issue, we went downstairs to the lobby to inquire about the messages played on the hotel intercom. Once there, no one seemed sure what was going on and the elevators were shut down. Upon finding Carlos, he explained everything he knew and showed stairs to return to our room.During our checkout valet fiasco, we met Edwin about 40 minutes into our wait. Hearing of our circumstances, he took our valet ticket, spoke with a couple staff members and assured us the car was on its way. While we waited, he was very sociable and explained what may have been taking so long. The car arrived shortly afterward and he helped load our car. Without Edwin, we may have been waiting another hour.So, in summary of the hotel:For European tourists, not American ones.They need more staff members and more immediate service when requested.Carlos and Edwin are champions of that hotel and I hope the managers recognize that. If you stay there, find them and ask for their help.","Detroit, Michigan","TonyMelcorri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",3,3.0

The rooms are extremely small, all other employees are not helpful and in fact some were downright rude. I wanted a receipt for my stay but the woman insisted I did not need it and would not give me one. I needed a bellhop to help with luggage on departure, but I guess Carlos was no working at the time and Edwin was busy out front. It took an hour to get our car and that was only after Edwin was persistent. We called for it as directed o the slip we were given at arrival. The number did not work. We called the front desk and was told ""yes, that number doesn't work."" hmmmm. We had breakfast included but one day had to argue that fact before we got it. The fire alarms went off and after 5 min were told they were investigating, but never said we should evacuate, stay in our room, etc. Oh, and this is a no smoking hotel which is great, but all the European's stand right outside the hotel doors and smoke that you have to go through a fog to get in and out.I would not recommend this hotel especially for the price.","Detroit, Michigan","Kermie758</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",3,3.0

We walked one block and was in the middle of the crazy (good) Times Square or we walked in the opposite direction and we were in Hells Kitchen where we could pick from dozens of great restaurants. Central Park was also in walking distance. But if you then wanted to walk around most of Central Park it turns out to be along walking day. We walked approx 25 km one day doing just that and doing the American Museum of Natural History on the same day.We had a Deluxe Room with 2 Double Beds. It was great with a good view. It was clean, spacious with a great bathroom.Front Desk Staff were very good. Helping us every time we asked. We got room service one night and it was wonderful.If you have breakfast included you are in for a treat. It is HUGE. There is Sooo much on offer and it is all yummy. There is no way you will go hungry. We sometimes ate so much that we did not have to worry about lunch while out and about. That's a bonus.By the way there are no negative points to report. We may have been lucky but I think it is because the Hotel is very professional.One thing you should know is New York is noisy.

From continental to full cooked breakfast, there were enough options to not get bored eating breakfast here for a week.The breakfast areas can get very busy and it can be hard to get a table. You may also have to queue a couple minutes in the food queue.A word of advice – when allocated a table, leave something there to show that the table is occupied. We had an issue where we left our table to get our food and somebody had sat there whilst we were getting our food from the buffet. The coffee is amazing and the fact that they have take out coffee cups is great too! The bar in the hotel is also great – they offer a happy hour every day between 3-7pm ($8 per cocktail) and the drinks were great! The staff in the bar could be slightly friendlier but on the whole, good service!The location of this hotel is key!

The toilet was in a separate room and there was a double sink in the shower room. The breakfast was really good also we all over indulged everyday. In the lounger there was chairs, a tv, a fridge full of bottled water, soft drinks, fruit, ham, cheese. There were pastries and bread rolls but these were only replenished once a day.

We also had access to a shared lounge on the 26th floor. This would have been great, except it was poorly stocked and frustrating to use. For example we would go to make some hot tea in the afternoon (we are British) and the hot milk that had been left out in the morning would have curdled into something resembling cottage cheese. So I would take the lift down to reception and ask for some cold milk. Reception world send me to the bar and the bar would send me to the cafe and the cafe would send me back to reception. After going through this farce several times I gave up and bought my own milk. But seriously, why not just leave some cold milk in the fridge?!

The room was utilitarian with modern furniture which had sharp edges that I managed to scratch myself on. My biggest complaint is the fire alarm system.

I would not stay at this hotel again unless I could be re-assured that the problem with the fire alarm has been resolved.

We were on floor 22 which had amazing views of the city, the lift was quick and never had to wait for one. We had breakfast at the hotel which was buffet style with a variety of different choices. Very delicious and always hot! Lunch and dinner is available in the fashion restuarant which is excellent value for money, the lunch offer is fantastic.. all you can eat salad, main and dessert for less than $15 each! On departure our flight was at 23.00.. we were offered late checkout or somewhere to leave our bags.. we left our bags with the bell boy who had them ready for us on our departure..We absolutely love this hotel and will definitely be recommending and returning.

It's only a block away from where we stayed last year, so it's close to Times Square too. So why is it better than the last hotel? It's new, it's quirky, it's interior design is vibrant & the rooms are not your typical NY size rooms. You have room to move! The beds & the bathroom are bigger- even the TV is bigger. The room is bright & refreshing & new. For a similar price to what we paid per night last year this hotel is now our choice. We're so glad we didn't go back to the last hotel. As expected, it's very clean & the service at reception & dining is polite & efficient. The other point of difference is the breakfast included. Full buffet breakfast included for the same price! The only recommendation we have is to put a kettle in the room for coffee. But if not having coffee facilities in the room ensures the room rates remain competitive, then we can do without.

The bathroom was a fair size and the shower was heavenly.

All of them serve all of the floors, so if you're high up it takes ages to get down, and if you're on the lower floor wanting to go down, you might have to wait a good while for a free lift with space for yourselves and luggage.The breakfast is fine, but with only two lines, it's insufficient for the number of guests.

Hotel is ideally placed for the tourist attractions, a short walk from the bustle of Times Square and within walking distance of other places such as Broadway, Empire State etc. Tube minutes away, giving easy access to further areas. Couldn't ask for a better location! Hotel was lovely and clean, modern and luxurious lobby, gym open 24 hours. Breakfast was fantastic, help yourself buffet including fresh fruit, meat, cheese, pancakes, pastries, cereals etc. Sets you up for the day, meaning you don't need to splash out on lunch. Cafe downstairs to buy snacks during the day, restaurant serves lunch and evening meals. Visited restaurant on last day and pleasantly surprised by quality of food and price. It is very expensive to eat out in NY, the hotel compared favourably with other local eateries.The room was on the small side with 2 double beds pushed together and 1 sofa bed, but we managed fine with teenagers. You don't go to NY to sit in your room! TV and fridge, complimentary water on first day only, (go down to the gym to refill with chilled water!), free wifi.Friendly staff, polite and always with a smile - couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.

Have visited a few Hotels in NY which I have been mainly happy with. Upon arriving I was very impressed with the modern Decor of the reception and the bar/ restaurant area very clean and well maintained. We were greeted by a very helpful and courteous receptionist apologies for not remembering her name. We were given a room on the 30th floor 3017 which was a little smaller than I expected but still a nice room with a floor to ceiling window allowing plenty of light with a view onto 8th Ave and 46th Usual amenities safe fridge iron etc step in shower. Big screen TV and super quick Wifi for up to 4 devices. The location was very good one Ave over from Hell's Kitchen at 9th Ave and step out your on 46th RESTAURANT ROW. Turn left your one Ave from the bright lights of Times Square and right in the middle of the theatre district you're also just 4 blocks from the port authority bus terminal head north up 8th Ave to Columbus circle and you're just across from Central Park. We loved the Riu Plaza and will most probably visit again. That said there were a few things we weren't totally happy about. One of them being house keeping main problem being that on one occasion our room door was left open whilst we had been out most of the day. I appreciate this would not have been done purposely but security of your room and possessions should be absolute priority. When this was reported to reception it took sometime to get a favourable response due to the first person we spoke to not really having a full grasp of English. After this we were then passed onto someone senior who handled the situation. I have to say Riu have since done everything to Compensate us for the oversight and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel great location excellent restaurant and bar. Couldn't be more helpful and excellent food. The doormen I found to be generally very friendly and helpful. I thought no maybe one or two on reception could do with maybe a little more training but that was just our experience. I think Riu Plaza should reconsider their plan to only offer packages with breakfast included pushing up the price. As I think this might alienate some and lose customers. So hoping they rethink this but if you're happy to be restricted to only having breakfast at the hotel then this is the one for you.,"Harrow, United Kingdom","Bryan K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harrow, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

The bar also had a happy hour which was good,if you fancy a drink before dinner. The bar staff were excellent,as were most of the staff. My only criticism of staff were the staff behind the desk, who didn't seem to communicate to each other or understand the rules of being a Riu loyalty card owner. We had been granted a late check out by one of the desk staff, but we were then asked to leave before our agreed time and told there would be a charge. It was all sorted out in the end but very disappointing. Can I also warn everyone that the price you have been promised on your booking website will not include the hotel tax and the New York residency tax which, for us, came to about 150 dollars. Another tip I would give is if you are getting a taxi to the airport ask one of the doorman to get you one as it will cost a lot less.The hotel is a great starting place for your adventure in New York and is wonderfully located.

The hotel is new having opened I believe in March last year and you can tell that it is new. It has a modern look about it both inside and out. We were on the 28th floor which is the top floor and had a room looking down onto the street below aswell as being able to see some of the lights of Times Square. All in all it was an awesome view through the large windows. Check in was very quick, I had read reviews of long lines and slow check in but no such thing for us and this was around 4pm aswell. The room was well appointed, small but standard for many NYC hotel rooms. The furniture is basically white which makes the room look bright if as some reviewers have said a little clinical but I liked the look of the room. There were some marks on the walls which looked like they may have been from suitcases or similar but overall the room was clean. I guess that it is downside of having a light and white room. The bathroom has a shower however be aware that it does have a glass partition which from the room itself means that when someone showers their outline is visible. This isn't anything really new in NYC hotels as I have stayed in them before with the same thing but if you aren't expecting it, this may bother you. The toilet does have a sliding door and when this is being used you cannot see through the glass shower partition. Free wi-fi is in the hotel and this was fairly stable during our stay.

We stayed on the 16th floor and we had a very good view of the busy streets, windows were well glazed as when they were closed, you could hear no outside noise. The in room temperature control worked well and the ensuite shower was really good. The bed was comfortable, there was enough closet space for two. My only gripe was that the room was too small, no space to store our cases. I think just coming in from Vegas where our room was huge, we were a little spoilt.

We went for a special occasion so I emailed ahead and requested a room on a high floor - they gave us a room on floor 24 out of 27 - ideal! The hotel is in the perfect location just one block away from the centre of Times Square. If you are a first time visitor to NYC, you'll be reassured to know that you can get to all the main attractions very easily from here. We walked down 5/6/7th Avenues, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Macy's - and there's a subway right in Times Square so we had easy access to the 9/11 memorial and Statue of Liberty. The hotel itself is really new, very clean, super modern and nicely decorated. The rooms are a really good size. I've seen people complain about room sizes in NYC but honestly what do you expect? We had a comfortable double bed, dressing table, fridge, wardrobe, safe and iron and ironing board. Cable TV also includes plenty of channels. I imagine it could be a little noisy if you were on a low floor, due to emergency services, taxis, but hey - it's New York. The noise didn't bother us where we were. Breakfast was included in our package. Like everything in NYC, breakfast was somewhat chaotic. It gets extremely busy whatever time you go down and expect to queue for a table, but the queues go down pretty fast. There isn't a great selection and it's a buffet so you can't request anything different. Food is very average but sufficient to start your day. I probably wouldn't have paid for it had it not been included. There is a Pret a Manger right outside so if you were stuck you could always go there for a snack. Lastly, the hotel staff were very polite and friendly. I had a mini crisis after check out where I realised I'd left a ring in our safe! But the gentleman on reception raced straight upstairs with me to help me find it. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. Check out itself is a very quick and easy process and we didn't have to queue. You can also pay for late check out if you want, nice option to have!

Just a block from the hustle and bustle of Times Square yet far enough away to feel a bit separated from the action.The hotel had a very modern vibe and the decor was interesting. It was an expensive place to stay and for the price did not provide many extras.Due to booking late I secured a family room with two double beds. The room was quite spacious. Although the beds are technically separate they are pushed together. I'm not sure that i would want more than two or 3 people in the room let alone a family. There was very little storage.I have read some reviews from people commenting about the frosted glass of the shower and toilet and lack of privacy. I can understand that this may be off putting however in my opinion i can assure people that privacy was not compromised. When my husband was in the shower all one could see from the room was a very distorted silhouette. There was a small bar fridge but no tea or coffee making facilities.

We are based in Ireland and the reservation was for an Irish competition prize, so it was a big deal to our client and ended up being a very big deal to the winner's cohort for all the wrong reasons. First of all, pre-payment methods seemed to be non-existent. We fully understand card security etc, but no flexibility/accommodation was given by the hotel. Surely pre-payment on behalf of a client is something that an international hotel would be accustomed to. After weeks of to-ing and fro-ing however, the hotel managed to muster up a pre-authorisation form as an ""exception"". If this ""exception"" was conducted earlier on, it would have saved us and indeed the hotel a lot of time and bother.This delay and tardiness leads to the second issue. Due to the delay in pre-authorisation, we were put in an embarrassing situation, whereby the competition winner party had to use their own card to pay for the rooms... Essentially paying for their own prize! Luckily our winner understood the predicament that the hotel had put us in... If it wasn't for check out, when the hotel tried to take payment again, not once but twice and maxed out the guest's credit card! This caused a highly stressful and embarrassing situation to be in, impacting on mortgage payments and direct debits coming out of the card that the hotel had incorrectly maxed out.

Where to start.....upon arrival the doorman took our bags (very nice) we checked in and we were told they were taking $200 on our credit card and this would be taken off the final bill - ok. We went to our 'Family Deluxe Room' - oh no, there's been a mix up. When we entered the room we were confronted with two double beds pushed together and little to no room to walk around the beds, let alone place our suitcases for 5 people anywhere. Also, There were no solid walls for the bathroom, just frosted glass, the thought of watching my kids and husband on the toilet is not nice and having my 13 yo son in the room while I shower is weird. I went back to reception and advised we thought we had been given the wrong room. The receptionist was quite frank and told me that was well big enough for 5 people and a standard family room. I asked him if he would shower in front of his mother like that - he said no! Our hand was forced (as we couldn't spend 11 days in a dog kennel) and we had to pay for the next sized room (not in the budget) but they couldn't move us for 3 nights. It's lucky they didn't move us right away because it took over an hour to get our bags delivered and this only happened because my husband went to chase them up.Obviously the person who designed the family rooms with one large bed and access to watch each other shower and go to the toilet had a very SPECIAL relationship with their family.While staying there we talked to other quests who had the exact same experience as us! They were also waiting to be moved to a larger room.Upon departure we didn't get back our $200 they were holding (we forgot to ask) The rooms were cramped, dusty and not finished (painting half done, tiles held on with tape) Lino floors is not what you expect for that price.

Didn't spoil our visit though. We went out and bought some. Room was more than adequate for us. 2 queen sized beds which were very comfortable. Not the biggest room we've stayed in, but who needs a large room when visiting New York. Only used for sleeping in. As for the glass panelled bathroom, which people moan about, where's the problem? Glass is heavily frosted and we couldn't see each other,but then, we weren't looking. We're not prudes or shy, so maybe not a problem to look for. Took breakfast in the hotel. Bit chaotic, but everything was fine. Everyone wanted to be fed and ready for sight seeing and arrived around the same time. Go early, or a bit later. Plenty of choice, unless you're really fussy. Always shown to a clean table and all the staff were smiling and appeared happy. Shower gel ran out 1st day, but not replaced. We took it off the wall to make the point, but it was just moved. By day 3 I put it in the middle of the shower and it was replenished. No big drama as we had taken our own. On the last day we got 2 bottles of water put in the fridge. Too late! We had brought our own anyway. Opted for a late checkout, as we were getting picked up at 5.30PM. Not a problem. Paid the fee on checkout and not too expensive compared to other hotels.

Plush reception with polite and friendly staff. Check in was relatively quick and bell boy handled all the luggage up to the room. Could have done it myself but I'm on holiday so why not.Then we get to the room. For something that cost over $300 a night I can only rate the room as very basic and based on UK hotels, budget standard. Toiletries in the shower room, telly on the wall, two bottles of water in the fridge and that's your lot. No coffee making facilities, mini bar or posh slippers.We did ask reception if we had the right room and were told that none of the rooms have tea or coffee facilities and to get more room amenities we would have to upgrade to a suite. Having what is classed as a deluxe double leads you to think that the room would be reasonably equipped. Wrong!I did pay a visit to the bar on one occasion to get a coffee and a beer. Couldn't have a glass pint glass as I was taking it to the room so had to have two glass bottles. Health and safety apparently. $25 and the beer was out of date! Got a refund on the beer but restaurant manager didn't seem to see my point that he was selling out of date stock. Dated Sep 2016 with 180 day consume by advice. It's now April 2017.Although we enjoyed our time in NY, the hotel let the holiday down. I'm sure there are plenty of other hotels that offer the same standard of accommodation and facilities for a lot less money or other hotels that offer more for the same money. Either way won't be recommending the Rui as a value for money place to stay.","England, UK","Pipey123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England, UK</strong>",10,3.0

Pretty much anything you would want to see served at breakfast is available. This certainly kept us going all day.Our room was a decent size for two people. Clean and tidy. The room includes a safe (which the previous occupant decided would be a great idea to leave locked. This cost us about an hour of our time while the hotel staff came to unlock it).There was in iron and ironing board as well. Unfortunately there was no tea or coffee making machine in the room and the selection of TV channels is extremely basic.There was one big problem with our room. The design of the bathroom wall and sliding door.The bathroom wall which is adjacent to the bed is opaque glass. So when you needed to see a man about a dog at 2 O'clock in the morning the whole room lights up when you turn the bathroom light on. The sliding door (also opaque) is a great space saver, however not very private even when closed. You would indeed need to be very comfortable with the person you are sharing the room with.

I did not partake of any of the hotel's restaurants as you are so close to both Times Square and Hell's Kitchen and the literally hundreds of restaurants and deli's nearby.

It's got a good location, the rooms are small but clean and spare, and the furnishings relatively new. The rooms lack some basic amenities, like coffee-making facilities or a clock-radio, and the bathrooms are very small (no tub).However, the ""soft product"" (the part under the control of the day-to-day management) at this hotel is absolutely awful. On arrival, it took the desk clerk almost 30 minutes to check us in (for a fully pre-booked reservation), with much hemming and hawing and shuffling back and forth. On the first morning, we arrived at the breakfast room to find a line of 75+ guests snaking down the hall, down a set of stairs to the basement, and down the hall there -- all waiting for breakfast. Once seated, we saw a single woman seated at a table by one manager, and when she got up to get the buffet, another couple was seated at her table, displacing her!On the second morning we went to the elevators, and they didn't work -- the call button simply went out after being pushed. We tried again and again, but gave up after 10+ minutes and walked down the fire stairs to the lobby, where a manager told us that they were running them on manual, and would have gotten to us ""eventually"" if we had called on the phone! There is no phone in the elevator lobby on each floor.And at 2am on the second night/third morning we were awoken by a fire alarm -- a piercing shriek. As we quickly dressed and prepared to leave a voice came on saying to stay in our rooms, but then the alarm proceeded to go off again four more times, each time followed by a garbled announcement -- in four languages -- to stay in our rooms, it was a false alarm. This went on for 20+ minutes.If you read the other reviews, our experience is clearly not a new one, these things happen often. The management of this hotel clearly has no idea what they are doing, and in my experience it would be a mistake to stay here.

(#3 below is the main reason).1)The room was hot, and I'm pretty sure the thermostat was just for looks - didn't seem broken, just seemed fake. I called downstairs to ask for someone to come up but no one ever did. 2)They didn't have bottled water available on the property after their store closed. I'm not even kidding. I was relatively ok with no ice machines and not a vending machine on site (too American for this cool Euro-prop), but when I went to the bar to buy bottled water, he only had 2 bottles. Again, ok with that, but the next night I went back and he had none. None on the property. I went to the front desk and actually had to complain that it seemed crazy to spend $815 for 2 nights and I can't buy bottled water??? After a few minutes of complaining, the front desk clerk went to a manager who was listening in the background at a desk, but never atttemped to come intervene, and he ok'ed the release of 3 bottles of water from some secret place in the back. It was just weird.3)The final and biggest issue making this property a poor choice for any traveler....When we were ready to leave, I gave the hotel attendant my parking reciept. He said the car would be around in 20 minutes because of traffic. This was at 4:07 pm. I didn't not get my car until 5:10 pm. It was ridiculous. He forgot to put the request in the system to retrieve the car from the parking company that they contract with. I found this out after waiting for 30 minutes and going up to ask what the deal was. It took another 30 minutes to get the car after they realized their mistake. At this point, I insisted they bring our bags to the front, because I didn't want to lose more time once the car finally arrived. Our large duffle was missing, and a back pack belonging to someone else was on our cart. So after all this waiting time, I asked the bellman to ask the manager if she would consider paying the $120 for my parking, since I lost an hour because of their mistake and I also would have lost a duffle bag filled with valuable shoes. The bellman came back telling me the manager said she can't and won't pay it, and the only way I would get it paid was if the hotel employee himself would pay for his mistake."" Totally unprofessional. Total disregard for hotel guest. The kicker is that the gentleman who worked for the parking company, and brought me my car (not an RIU employee), told me ""they will probably pay for it, they've done it before"". So I know that the woman who was the manager on duty, on Friday, April 21st around 5 - 5:30, simply didn't care. Please reconsider staying here. If you like the decor, go to the bar for a drink.

Riu said they had been looking for 10 years for the right place in New York, well let me tell you, they have.What a stunning location, fantastic hotel and great staff.This hotel is literally 2 minute walk(when you can cross the road that is) from Times Square. It's central to everything you want to do, where you want to go. Can't fault this place at all. When we checked in, there was confusion with my booking, but this could have been due to us rescheduling our break, all resolved quickly and our room upgraded to boot.The rooms were lovely, functional but lovely, I mean you don't go to New York to live in your hotel room, bit like going to Paris.Comfy, cosy, warm, room with a view.Well done Riu, we loved it, we will be back to the same place with our girls.Oh and when in New York... use Uber, best way to travel by far.Don't know why I'm begging this hotel up.... it will be booked up now when I want to go back cos you all gonna book it lol... go ahead, it's great.","Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom","Ajmeaden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

The room is bright & airy. We had two double beds (3 people sharing) The bathroom/wet room is fab & packed with toiletries. The frosted glass door was not an issue, it didn't face the room & as your traveling with family, it's not a problem. Yes, the white Walls do have scuffs on them but it's a busy hotel. Great addition of having a fridge but a kettle would have been good. Hairdryer isn't very powerful but it does the job.Our view on level 5 wasn't great but we didn't go to look out the window. Considering we were only 5 floors up and next to the lift, we didn't experience any noise from the busy city outside or the lift. The hotel is a 5min walk to Times Square, subway stations & Carlos Bakery.The staff are friendly & helpful. We even had to get maintenance to break into our suitcases with no issue! He came up to our room with an angle grinder! Didn't use the breakfast or bar but did use the cafe which was lovely & fresh & good value. Having stayed in many Riu's before though, I do think this should be a bed & breakfast hotel.Would highly recommend & would stay here on my next trip!

First of all, this hotel seems luxurious (and you do pay the price for a luxury hotel) so it's natural to expect that you will have a good stay and that management would be be professional. We visited New York back in October 2016 and stayed here. From the moment we arrived, it took us forever to check in - it seems like the front desk was under-staffed for the number of people that were checking in at the time - which I found to be quite unprofessional. Guests are required to make reservations ahead of time - why can't management staff accordingly knowing that a lot of guests will be checking in? Also, we arrived a couple hours after check-in time, but our room was not even ready yet. Once we entered our room we sat on the bed only to find out that it was literally broken! The springs on one side of the bed had given in. So naturally, we requested another room, which required more waiting time on our end, which took away from our allocated time for sightseeing (we only were staying for a long weekend, so time was valuable to us). During our stay, a staff member literally just walked into our room without even knocking! And this person was not house keeping nor had we even request assistance with anything. Just a person with a key card just walked right in. We reported this at the front desk and were told that they would look into it. But throughout our stay we notice at least once on our floor a staff member entering a room with a key card and that staffer was not housekeeping. I've never seen that before at any other hotel and I find it to be rather sketchy. If you do stay at this hotel, be sure to take your valuables with you!On our last night, the fire alarm went on! What really bothered us was someone just walking into our room without even knocking - that's an invasion of privacy! We brought up our concerns with management once again at check out and to be honest they did not even care - all they did was give us a small piece of chocolate and I mean thinking back on it know I can't help but to chuckle! There are plenty of other hotels in NYC - and honestly this hotel is too close to Times Square. You're better off staying somewhere else.","Boston, Massachusetts","jenniferhomsy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",5,2.0

We flew from Heathrow to Newark with United Airlines. The flight was pleasant and on arrival at Newark we passed through Immigration and Customs which took approximately 25 minutes. We arrived in to Terminal B but we had to use the free airport transfer train to the airport train station, so we could jump on the New Jersey Transit to Manhattan. This train cos 13 USD each and took about 30 minutes to Penn Station. We then walked to the hotel which took about 15 minutes.On arrival we were greeted by a fairly friendly receptionist but who was lacking in information on the hotel. We paid the bill on arrival and were told of a 100 USD deposit to be paid which would be refunded on checkout. There is also a Facility Fee which includes use of the Wi-Fi, luggage storage facility and water in the room on arrival. Our room was at the very top of the hotel, the 28th floor, and the lifts were quick and efficient. As we had to get the lift to the very top of the building, we would constantly be stopped on the way down and up with other guests using the lifts and getting in and out. If this would annoy, then a top floor room may not be for you.We booked a junior suite. The room was very modern and featured a whirlpool bath, iron with board and free safe. There was a king size bed, flat screen TV and sofa. The views of Manhattan were stunning. The air conditioning unit had a digital control and the instructions were provided but I am unsure whether it worked correctly as we tried to change the temperature but the display would simply default back to the previous settings. Luckily the temperature in the room was suitable and this didn’t cause any issues. The Wi-Fi was available on up to 4 devices and the signal was very good. There was no minibar or kettle.We had pre-booked breakfast which was served between 7-11am. We went down on our first morning at 8am and the restaurant was manic. There is a queue to get in to the restaurant which forms into the lift area in the lobby which in turn causes a big scrum when people are trying to get in and out of the lifts. The design of the food and coffee area is also poor as everything is along one wall, so this caused constant queuing plus pushing in was rife to get the food that people wanted.The food was of a good standard with sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, and potato wedges. There was also bread, cereal, fruit and pastries. I was surprised to see no pancakes available. The coffee is from a vending machine and is drinkable. I initially asked a waiter for soya milk but was told they did not do this. I did not believe him so I went looking for the restaurant manager who got my soya milk for me no problem. He also remembered to get me this on the following 2 mornings. The restaurant was on the lobby level and had windows that looked out on to the street and you could people watch while you ate.As we had booked a junior suite we had access to the Crown Level Executive Lounge on floor 26, which offered free coffee from a pod machine, Coke/Diet Coke/Sprite/still water bottles, and a small assortment of bread, jam and pastries. There were also a few bottles of wine available. The room is quite small and only seated no more than 20 people at once but this was never a problem for us as only once out of our 3 visits was anyone else in there. There is a large TV mounted on the wall available for use. When we first tried to enter the lounge my key card would not work and we had to have this sorted by reception, this obviously had not been activated correctly at check-in.There were a few niggles that we were not happy with, which mainly arose due to the staff and service level. I arrived on my birthday and I was not wished a Happy Birthday by the reception and nothing was left in the room on the day or during the rest of our stay. I find this extremely rude and I have taken a mark off the score due to this. I assume the staff training is a work in progress as not all staff seems to have the same knowledge. In the service industry this is disappointing. Hopefully this is rectified and this aspect of the hotel improves. We did not use the hotel bar, restaurant or gym so cannot comment on these amenities. As other reviews have stated the hotel is very well located for Times Square and the subway, as these are only a few blocks away. The hotel offered a luggage room service on check-out but we did not require this. I would recommend the hotel for all types of travellers who wish to enjoy a city break in Manhattan, but be prepared that it is not the epitome of excellent customer service and luxury.Overall, the hotel is not perfect and is slightly pricey but we did enjoy our stay and would definitely stay again due to the brilliant location.Any questions just drop me an email.","Maidstone, United Kingdom","davey_baby100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maidstone, United Kingdom</strong>",240,3.0

The hotel is still quite new, everything is still fairly new, the lobby area is very trendy in a modern, colourful style and (on our arrival) not too busy which made it more relaxing. We were checked in straight away and had requested prior to travel a high floor which was honoured (24th out of 28) The rooms again were very modern & minimalist in style, definitely not large which we knew but had 2 full double beds with plenty of walk around space, room safe taking a full laptop, HUGE flatscreen TV with a good choice of channels and simply stunning views of the city by day & night through floor to ceiling windows. The only drawback was that the room lacked any drawer space to store clothes at all which was unusual - other than a tiny draw in bedside cabinets the wardrobe only offered hanging space - not a huge issue but something to be aware of. Numerous reviews seem to focus on the bathroom and its opaque glass walls, not a problem to us (they are not the only hotel doing this now, Secrets in Cancun do the same for example) it is not possible to see anything other than a shadowy outline and the view from the window draws your attention anyway. We were advised on check in that our reservation included the buffet breakfast each day - a real bonus as we were not aware of this - we had a problem that the reception system had not advised the breakfast room system that breakfast was included so we had to get a member of reception go & physically tell them (a bit embarrassing when standing in a queue) and this happened all 4 mornings, but I have to say the restaurant manager was fantastic as he personally waited for us each morning & told us to go straight in to avoid any more embarrassment - top class customer care!!The hotel bar is very smart, and a real relaxing haven after a long day sightseeing, they have a happy hour(s) from 3-7 with cheaper cocktails & wine and a bar food discount which was very nice.The only negative we have about our stay has been mentioned by another reviewer and that is the bellboys trying to book you a taxi back to JFK - they offer a service that includes tolls & tips at $75 and try to tell you that the yellow cabs will put you on a metered fare, will make the journey longer & it will cost you more...simply not true!! we had them hail a yellow cab outside, the flat rate fare to JFK was $52.00 plus 80c in taxes, he took a route that avoided ANY tolls and with a tip it cost us $60 - this is a really nice hotel, please stop spoiling your reputation with this behaviour, stop scaremongering guests into a more expensive deal.Overall we had a fantastic stay and for anyone looking for a really modern base with midtown right on the doorstep we would highly recommend the RIU","Torrox, Spain","The-Wandering-Whites</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Torrox, Spain</strong>",111,5.0

The rooms are also modern, but that's about where the comparisons end. Our room was tiny. There was a kind of non-opaque wall between the shower and the bedroom area such that you can see the outline of whoever is in the shower. That would have been a little uncomfortable if I was with anyone but my fiance. The bathroom door was also just a slider, which didn't give the most privacy. The worst part was that in the morning, a family across the hall decided to get ready with the door open. At 7 am, you could hear everything, from kids to a hair dryer. Not ideal for your vacation.

There are also blackout curtains, which you need because of all the light coming in to our room from the Times Square signs, even late at night, from our side of the hotel. This is one of those hotels trying to be "" hip"" and stylish, including speakers on the outside of the hotel playing club music. as you stand outside the hotel on the sidewalk. New York City is really not in need of additional noise pollution in this very noisy part of the city, so this struck me as a strange idea. The lobby is overbright, with harsh, intense lighting bouncing off of the white shiny floors. I prefer lobbies with subdued lighting and a quieter welcome. Also strangely, the halls outside the rooms are wood veneer flooring instead of carpeting, so be prepared to hear people walking down the halls at night and dragging their suitcases along those hard floors. Very echoey. The room is tiny, as many new york hotels are, though I would have expected slightly larger for the rates they charge. The really strange thing is the bathroom..there is a sliding glass door instead of a wood door that closes properly. The glass door leaves a tiny gap when closed, so depending where you are in the room you can see your fellow guest sitting on the toilet through the gap in the door. Just something to know if the idea of your roommate hearing and seeing your business on the toilet makes you uncomfortable. My only guess is that this saved space rather than using a wood door that closes properly. There is also a glass partition, (frosted) allowing people in the room to see the shadow/ silhouette (distorted, but there nevertheless) of whoever is taking a shower on the other side of the glass. I could see why one review mentioned that their teenage daughter was uncomfortable about this! Something to be aware of depending who is with you in the room. Room was over-warm and difficult to adjust the thermostat. Also annoyed by the hidden charge in the form of a ""resort fee"", just another way to make the rate higher without showing in the total..Why not just be honest and add this to the regular rate, given that this is not a resort, and not sure how they justify this fee. Would stay here again if we got a very good rate, but there are hotels I have enjoyed much more.","Toronto, Canada","Steve1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",116,3.0

One morning we were awoken by an alarm of some sort. I went off again later in the morning before we left for the day. I was told not to worry about it. We were awoken early on our last day by repeated alarms and then by someone knocking repeatedly that they needed to come in to check the smoke alarm. We had had a late evening and having to let someone into our room at 9 a.m. was not appreciated. Not a place I would advise and definitely not a place we will return to.

The bed was the same height as the wheelchair so easy to transfer . All good. The staff was very friendly and chatty and more importantly helpful. Especially the doorman who help out with a situation. Lovely steaks and club sandwich in the restaurant. Getting around New York was easy I walked where my husband propelled we managed to get to ground zero to Central Park, grand central, Empire State by using a map. Loads of drop kerbs. The only downside is some of the restaurant aren't accessible due to stairs or step. A little found Amy's bread use to get tea and cake there for afternoon.

This hotel is part of a large Spanish chain with a huge presence in Latin America. This hotels brings a distinct concept for NY. Riu is usually a vacation hotel, and they bring the same idea to NY. I'm not saying it doesn't work for business travelers, it should, but it is well geared for people that want to be out and about the city. The hotel has a nice modern reception, two restaurants one nicer and with a bar, the other fast coffee shop/bakery/sandwich concept. I didn't use the restaurants nor their gym or other facilities but they have the basics.The rooms have all around tile flooring. I like this. Great for people with asthma/allergies, and also, they are always cleaner than a rug will ever be. Now with tile flooring you'll have less sound proofing, but I didn't feel that the room was noisy.The bath room is encased by privacy glass and a sliding door. You can't see through, but you can see some profiles. So take this into consideration if you're sharing the room with others. This is a new trend in hotels and it is not going to go away. It makes the rooms require less wall space sacrificing privacy. Not a huge issue for me.It has a very basic desk, a good size HD TV with basic programming- no HBO, Cinemax, etc.- as I said before, this hotel is geared for people that want to be outside of the room. The mattress was VERY comfortable. What I found not so good was the bedding. It was perfectly clean, but at only a few months old the fabric is starting to look tired. It may be that the washing cycle is too strong, or that the fabric simply isn't durable. There were only two pillows for a queen bed, and two soft euro cushions. I rather have four pillows.The room has a fridge, a large programmable safe, great views of the Hudson river and other parts.I think the price was great. Certainly a lot of value for staying here and I am sure they will be very busy come summer.One added bonus is that the hotel allows for extending checkout up to 4:PM and 6:PM at a surplus charge $40 and then $10 per hour.It is on restaurant row and just across the street from Broadway theaters.

Slightly hidden away from, but adjacent by 2 blocks, to Times Square. Would consider using this hotel again but given a choice we would have paid a little extra for a bigger room and better views, and/or to stay in a different hotel with more street appeal. Overall happy with stay and service.Location: Situated a short 5 min stroll west 2 blocks from the red steps on Times Square. Easy walk to all theatres which we did one of the evenings, and within walking distance of Rockefeller, Maces and Empire State Building. We chose the hotel to be more in the hustle of Times Square, good choice in that respect, and although it is slightly hidden away, that became a benefit when we just wanted to chill out. Plenty of coffee bars, pizza, ice cream eateries down the adjoining street if that appeals, but not too touristy walking back to the hotel late evening.Hotel: The hotel felt modern, the reception area, bar and restaurant were welcoming (not intimidating), bright and looked recently decorated. The check-in was easy although the room was not ready (we arrived early and did not expect it to be) which allowed us to ask for a room on a higher floor with views, which the hotel kindly arranged (27th floor). Worth ensuring you are registered as a RIU Member as I am sure this helped. We were able to leave our bags and spend a few hours sight-seeing. Equally, when we checked out we were allowed to leave our bags in a secure room until early evening free of charge. Concierge, valet and all staff were courteous and helpful. We used the bar once for a snack and drink (Nachos and G&T), reasonably priced and served nicely to the table, although not a large area the décor was pleasant, fresh and modern.Room: This would have been the only criticism; it was on the small side with a king bed and small desk in the corner. Barely enough room to walk around the bed - could not open the suitcases without putting them on the bed. Impressive views over Manhattan skyline but the room was the wrong side to see any named sights; looked towards Times Square but you can not see anything. A bit more attention to detail on the house keeping would have helped although the shower was lovely, clean and reasonably sized. There have been some comments about seeing the person in the shower through the glass wall partition but we thought that was a nice modern touch and it was only a shadow outline. We did not expect a large room being central to Times Square, and given the price, we were not overly concerned - it was modern and looked clean, and we were out most of our stay. Comfortable stay, free Wi-Fi, and large flat screen TV, although no coffee making facilities. Fridge in bedside useful to store your own drinks.Food: We did not use the restaurant although we did get a coffee on a few occasions from the snack cafeteria which links to the hotel. This is a great facility although limited in opening times - more an early morning, afternoon snack and early evening stop-off than anything substantial.","Holywell, United Kingdom","x8tag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Holywell, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

Upon arrival, we pulled up front and we were lost on what to do. Dean was the only one who greeted us of the 5 or so workers in the lobby. After a good minute of looking around lost, on what to do for parking he saw us and helped up right away. The front desk was not busy at all, I walked right up to a blonde women in the center, I am a front desk agent myself and I could not believe how I was treated. She said ""credit card and I.D as soon as I walked up, no greeting whatsoever. When she placed two sheets in front of me she said sign here, and here and continued on conversating with the other blonde haired women beside her (neither of them had name tags on). I felt like we were bothering them, but being my fiance's birthday I asked for a high floor so we could see the city anyway. She said ""not sure but I'll see what I can do."" I understand limited availability, because like I said before I work at a hotel but she definitely could have phrased it differently. Once were got up to the 17th floor, the room was very small, which was expected of NYC just wanted to add that for people who mind. There were two small decorative pillows on the bed, we were not going to use them, they were flat and did not have covers on them, so many others have probably used them so I called down for two more regular pillows. If the lack of a greeting wasn't enough, this definitely topped it off, when the women answered she said hello. I asked for two pillows, I heard many people in the background so I figured they were busy, but I'm sorry if you work at a 600 room hotel you should be able to handle it. She said ""sure,"" I said ""thank you"" with a response of ""bye"" and hung up. On top of that they never came. I came down maybe an hour and a half later and went to the customer service desk and told her, I think she wrote something on my reservation stating what happened. The next day got even better. (sarcasm) I woke up to use the shower, it leaked all over the floor. We cleaned it up and were leaving so I put the ""request of service"" sign on the door around noon. We came back after three, not only was the room not serviced but there was a women and a man standing in our room with the door open while all of our stuff was in there. The women was apologetic and explained in was an engineer but never told us what they were in there for. She saw the sign on the door but still asked if we wanted service? Weird, but okay. I just took the sign off and said it's fine. I was getting really irritated. My fiance and I left again to go out for a few hours. When we got back to the room later that night he realized some of his cash out of his drawer was missing (I did not think we had to use the safe, because the DND sign was up) Sadly enough it was about $450 dollars missing after he went through all of his cash, we could not go out or do anything Saturday night because of it. I was literally in tears. I walked down to the front desk and I don't even know why I bothered, we were just bothering them again! Needless to say checkout was the same, not knowing that I signed an express check out form because she did not explain it to me the guy that took my keys looked at me like an idiot when in reality it's his departments fault. We are out money, a birthday memory and a one time a year experience. I just called the operator to speak to a manager before I was going to post this, but they were in a meeting, and the only way of contact is email. She laughed when I said can I leave my phone number. I feel really violated and unappreciated. So here is my essay, that could have been prevented by talking to someone with some TLC.","Syracuse, New York","KaylaFS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>",7,1.0

Service within the hotel was also fine, nothing special but definitely not bad. If this hotel was offering a great rate, I would stay there again. The bad sides are that we were never provided with the 'complimentary' water and when I asked reception I was simply told that they double check all water in the rooms before arrival so I must be wrong. I know it is only small, but I was parched when I arrived after my flight and it would have been great if it was there. Secondly, on one of the days, we had been given a badly stained towel. Don't get me wrong, it was clean, just stained. In a hotel of this size it is easy to see that the housekeeping team are under a lot of pressure, but it is a small thing that shouldn't have been overlooked. As I have said, otherwise the hotel was fine. There was nothing noteworthy about it, but nothing about it that you could say was bad. The views are excellent, so ask for a high level room if you can! The other bonus is that it has a huge sign on the roof, so if it is your first time to NYC, it is easy to find it! From the hotel it takes around 3 minutes to walk to Times Square and there are lots of restaurants and bars close by. This being said, it was not overly noisy (some noise should be expected as it is the busiest part of Manhattan after all) and we had no issue sleeping!

I like to try different locations depending on whom I am traveling with and the occasion. I was disappointed with this hotel. From the lobby it looks promising but sadly not once you got off the elevator at your floor. I had a room with a pull out bed for my teenager. Once this was pulled out you couldn't move around. There were three suitcases (three people in the room) and we had no space to put them anywhere except under the pullout sofa. The other things is this.....the shower wall is frosted glass and it faces onto the room. Whilst you cannot see the person clearly having the shower you can see the silhouette of them and all their actions. This was the same for the bathroom sliding door. It wasn't ideal for those self conscious people like a teenage girl. The other things was the pillows. They were lumpy...all 5 in our room. I called down for some other ones but I was told they were all the same. Then there was the very small print resort fee of $13 pp at the check out. I don't mind a resort fee if I was at a resort but this was no resort. When I asked about it, I was told it was for wifi. Really annoying because almost all hotels have free wifi in NYC. I went through a travel site for this reservation and it rated it as 4 stars. In my opinion, 4 star hotels don't have a combination shampoo/bodywash dispenser attached to the shower walls, chip wood laminate floors and lumpy foam pillows. The only plus side I could find to this hotel is the location for the theatre district.

(there is a small fridge). I'm british, its a necessity to wake up with a coffee and go to sleep with a nice cup of tea and this uoset me greatly. The hotel provide no hot drink facilities in the room at all nor do they offer the option of room service.

My husband, brother in law and I stayed here for 4 nights, both having king rooms next to each other. The hotel is spotlessly clean and all the staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing seemed like too much effort for them. Yes, the rooms are compact but I expected this for New York after reading many other reviews. The hotel is very modern with the most comfiest bed and pillows we've ever had at a hotel (or even at home!!). Huge wall mounted tv with loads of channels, not that you wanted to look at it given the views. We stayed in room 2820 (28th out of 30 floors) and we had a great view and could see some of the lights from Times Square. It was a little noisy with traffic but we didn't mind and it kind of added to the New York experience. The sockets next to the bed have USB sockets as well as two pin however these turned off when the overhead bed lights were turned out so not really practical for overnight charging. We just used them in the daytime and the other sockets at night. If you're staying as a couple the frosted glass partition between the shower and bedroom shouldn't be an issue but perhaps a little more privacy required if you're not, although having said that you could only see the outline of the person in the shower..perhaps take advantage of the great view whilst you wait!!!Looking west we could see the river and Intrepid museum from the hallway where the elevators were on our floor. Sampled drinks in the hotel bar, a pint of draft Bud will set you back $8 but this is quite normal for New York. Lots of other drinks selections and we ate in the hotel restaurant twice and had the best steak!! Bar staff and waiters were very friendly and polite. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was $24 dollars which I thought was a bit steep. Instead we walked 5 minutes from the hotel to the 'Times Square Diner and Grill' on 8th avenue (out of the hotel, left and left again) which I had read about on trip advisor. I would highly recommend this place, by no means dirt cheap but the portions are huge and soooooo tasty. We had waffles, pancakes and French toast and it was amazing...I sigh thinking about how nice it was now sat here writing this review We also ate here once at night and the food was equally as good. The hotel is in such a good location, literally 5 minutes walk from 42nd and 50th St subway stations so you can get virtually anywhere and 10 minutes from the centre of Times Square. Buy a $30 metro card as soon as you get to New York as you can use it unlimited for 7 days and it means you can hop on or off the subway whenever you like and is so easy. We even caught the $5 air train from JFK to the subway then onto the hotel with big cases very easily. Even as first timers we found the subway is really easy. Tip: We bought data for £4 a day (EE) to use before leaving the uk so we could use google maps whilst we were there and this was definitely worth it too for navigation and to find out what subway trains to catch and from which station. Saved a lot of time and a welcome break from our sore feet. The hotel is close enough to be in amongst it all but without the disadvantages of added noise and lights. I would imagine being any closer to Times Square may have these hotels wifi was great, really fast and available in the room. We weren't told of a specific separate charge for this but assumed it was in the extra $52 we had to pay at the end of the trip per room. On booking I was informed that there would be an extra $80 charge to pay at the hotel so I wasn't unduly surprised. As a general caution: Expect to tip at least 15% everywhere, this is worked out on your receipt, we made the mistake on our first night in Johns Pizza of leaving only 10% only to have the bill returned and 'reminded' that it is customary to leave at least 15%!!! To avoid this embarrassment again we made sure we tipped at least the minimum wherever we dined/drank. Another bar worth a mention is Jack Demseys which is right near the Empire State Building and had happy hour daily from 4-8pm and a pint of Bud was only $4. Really nice clean place with a friendly atmosphere. We would without a doubt return to this hotel which was very reasonably priced for the location without compromise on the quality and style. It was the most amazing trip and can't wait to go again!!","Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom","VickyB_secretunicorn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0

We decided to book this hotel because of its great location and value for money. Both turned out to be true to form!We paid, $563 for 5 nights (direct on the RIU website), working out to under £100 a night, which is a bargin for the location and quality of the hotel. I have seen many reviews where people have paid loads more, and so I can understand there frustrations against how much they paid. However for us, whilst there were some issues, you couldn't complain to much for how little we paid. Check-in was easy and we found all staff to be polite and friendly. They had fulfilled my earlier request of a room up on a high floor, and we were given the 25th, 3 from the top! Yes the room is small, but for a city break, you spend so little time and lets be honest, most rooms in NY tend to be on the small side anyway. The room was modern thanks to being newly built and done the job. In terms of quality, yes the shower did leak as many other reviews have mentioned (No issue really, just put a towel down), some of the finishing could be better, (slightly wonky odd tile etc) and unfortunately we did have to request the room the be cleaned again. Some hairs etc were visible. I think because its a fairly 'white' room design, you might see abit more than you would in darker hotel rooms, it was nothing to the point of thinking ""urgh this is disgusting"" just more ""could do with another quick once over"". The front desk staff were very apologetic and sent a cleaner up along with providing us the water that was missing. In terms of location, the hotel is PERFECT! You are one block west of Times Square and can see the advertising from between the buildings, and being positioned on 46th street you can walk to many of the great attractions. You have subway stations close by, a couple of mins walk, although getting the subway back to JFK was a bit of a pain as most old stations in NY dont have lift access, so carrying all the cases down the stairs was a pain, but saved the money compared to a taxi etc. Our room faced 8th Avenue itself, with noise never being to much of an issue, apart from the sirens of the fire station across the road....but hey, you're in New York so should be loving it! Can't comment on the restaurant or cafe within the hotel as never used. But why would you? People, you are in New York City, one of the greatest cities in the world, yet you want breakfast or food that they will sell in every RIU hotel across the world? Walk out the door, and explore the local options, so many options just a stones throw away! On check-out you could either pay the $12 a night service charge (for wifi access, welcome bottle of water and bag storage) by card or cash and we left our luggage for the last day with the concierge no problem. Overall a good stay representing great value for money. Yes some improvements could be made in terms of finishing touches, but would happily recommend a stay at the RIU Plaza Times Square. P.S - Anyone complaining about the shadow on the shower screen, is being over the top. You can barley see anything apart from a faint outline of your body shape.","Bourne End, United Kingdom","kyletay60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bourne End, United Kingdom</strong>",12,4.0

So did I, but that's another story :-) It's very close to Times Square and thus in the centre of it all. If you know NYC the hotel is located right between Times Square and the pier where the Entrepid is. You will love it here.I have one tip for the staff.

It was in a great location - from our bed we could see the centre of Times Square (the place/building where the Ball drops on NYE).I spent 4nights at the Riu with my mum. We stayed in a Queen room. I wasn't looking forward to sharing a bed with her but the bed was big enough that I didn't even feel like she was there. The room isn't massive but given that we were there for New York and not the hotel room I really didn't care - we only slept there. We used the coffee place downstairs (accessible from both hotel lobby and street) every morning for breakfast. I think the hotel had an option to add breakfast for around $20 per person (don't quote me on that price though) whereas in the coffee place we got 2 teas and 2 pastries for less than $12. The staff were very pleasant too. I can't comment on the hotel restaurant as we never used it.In the room there is a mini fridge with a ""Welcome Bottle of Water"" for each guest. Reviews have mentioned that their water didn't get replaced every day - if you read the hotel information in the room you would know this is just a ""Welcome Bottle of Water"". Reviews also mention the frosted glass walls for the bathroom. This is nothing to be concerned about. It is opaque glass and unless you're pressed against it you will see nothing - maybe the hint of a silhouette. The only issue I had with the room is the lack of tea and coffee facilities but other than that, I really can't think of any faults.Also, the hotel was lovely enough to leave me a note and a little box of chocolates in the room on my birthday.

Compared to some hotels I have stayed in fr the same price the room was better appointed and larger. I'm not too sure what the $14 facility fee was for, there is supposed to be water in the room but there wasn't, I asked and they said they would look for some but I guess they didn't find any. Also I had a letter on the desk with a pen (a room drop) but it was in German and for a different guest so I guess the housekeeping could have better attention to detail. I would definitely stay here again though, it would be interesting to see if their prices skyrocket during summer as currently, they are very reasonable for the quality of room.","Vancouver, Canada","Jason M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",71,4.0

We booked 3 nights at the RIU NYC and on the last night (1/28), my husband walks into the hotel and proceeds to go to our room. As he progresses toward the elevators, the security guard (Raphael Reynoso) aggressively charges him and states “we don’t have public restrooms for people like you”. WTF?!?!????? Never once did Raphael ask my husband if he was staying at the hotel or to show his room key. Instead, he saw a black man and automatically assumed he should not be in the hotel.What’s even more OUTRAGING is that I spoke to Joanne a front desk manager and Katherine the General Manager and they both made excuses for Raphael’s racist behavior and never once did they apologize for this egregious behavior. Joanne offered to upgrade my room…knowing I was checking out within minutes of speaking with her. And Katherine just stated there was nothing she could do to right the situation and directed me to contact customer service via email or Expedia where I booked the rooms. There is no way that she is not empowered to fix this type of situation. It is clear that she chose not to because we are BLACK. What she should have done was apologize for the egregious act and then offer to comp my room for the night. What I know for sure is that THIS IS NOT HOSPITALITY and the RIU hotel just bought themselves a TON OF NEGATIVE PRESS. My family spends at least $40K a year traveling the world and NEVER have we experienced ANYTHING like this!!!!To add to this awful experience, the overall service was horrible. On 2 occasions I had to have new pillows cases sent to the room because there were stains on the ones on the bed and then when we were leaving I called down for help with the bags (my husband went to get the car) and 20 minutes later they NEVER showed up so my daughter and I had to struggle with the bags ourselves.Now I have tweeted the corporate office and they have responded that they are sharing this incident with the appropriate department.

I really can't understand all the 'doomers and gloomers' who aren't happy with the rooms. We went to the room to sleep, to shower and to get ready to go out again..... isn't that what you go to New York for ????? IF I had been there to spend the weekend in my room it MAY have appeared small, but we didn't we went to see New York ! The glass in the bathroom isn't a see through glass it's an opaqe glass. Not the first hotel I've stayed in with this arrangement at all. Yes I could see the outline of my partner when she was in the shower ..... bonus ! But there was no way she could of been seen on the toilet ! If I had been with a family member it MAY possibly have been an issue if the lights were on in the bathroom and not in the bedroom but this really is no issue al all !The noise...... yes it's noisy....... it's New York City and you are in Times Square !!!! What do you expect !?!?! There are sirens, constant sirens, horns, hustle and bustle at all hours and more sirens !!! But it's New York City and it's Times Square...... if you don't like the noise........take ear plugs or go to Kansas ! There is a coffee shop in the lobby area and a restaurant also. We used neither as we were in New York and decided to sample the local food. The breakfast, as other reviews have stated was expensive, but there are lots of places to eat and cheaper within 2 minutes walk, but would be fine for convenience.There was a bottle of water each in the fridge on day 1 but not replaced and yes, there is no coffee machine in the room. However, trip advisor tip for you here..... the tap water IS drinkable ! AND the bottle we were given fits under the tap... go figure !!!! If we were in the room and needed tea or coffee we had been in the room too long and went out !!! Check out was no problem and was swift and polite. There is this additional charge of $13 per room per night which has been talked about in here and you are told about on check in...... not sure what it's for entirely but we knew about it so budgeted accordingly so don't be surprised and whine about it after you have stayed....... or go to Kansas ! All in all, a hotel within budget in the heart of New York that was clean, friendly, had a bed and ticked all of our boxes..... THANK YOU Riu Plaza New York.

The check-in process was a bit disappointing, as I could not check-in even a few minutes before 3pm (they didn't even look in their computer system to see if a room was available), and the front desk staff were generally cold in their demeanor.

Not normally one for writing reviews but probably one of the first to jump on here and read other people's reviews before booking my holiday. I booked this hotel for 6 days / 5 nights for a surprise for my wife's impending 40th birthday. I contacted the hotel before we travelled to let them know and asked about getting a high up room with a view. When we arrived at check-in we were given an upgraded room (25th floor) with a balcony.The hotels and rooms were spotless and we'll looked after. The room was plenty big enough with loads of hanging space for clothes, safe, large tv on the wall and a really comfortable bed. The bathroom had a large walkin shower, yes frosted glass at the wall and bedroom. The room was cleaned and sprayed fresh every day with fresh towels being left.Had no problems with any enquiries at the concierge and also free use of computers and printer for printing off tickets.The hotel is centrally located and ideal for walking distance to all tourist attractions and subways. Just bring comfortable walking shoes / boots as you will walk a lot we averaged 10 miles a day walking.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would not think twice about staying here again, we have stayed at Hotel thirty thirty, The Sherston and the Roosevelt before while being in New York and The Riu Plaza is by far the best and nicest that we have stayed in.","South Lanarkshire, United Kingdom","Craig M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Lanarkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

I was worried at first as it said that it was newly built and lot of people online had things to complain about it. Honestly, I don't know why they did. The hotel is clean, bright and the staff are so friendly! Check in was smooth and completed professionally, we were even given a free upgrade to our room. The rooms aren't overly big but have everything that you need - a massive bed, a safe, a wardrobe, tv, free wifi, fridge and a beautiful bathroom. I've never had such a lovely bathroom while staying on holiday. I noticed a lot of people complaining about the frosted glass being see through while you're in the shower. I didn't personally find it a problem as we just turned off the bathroom light, the frosted glass allowed for light from the main room to come in while the people outside not able to see in. Simple fix. The only downfall of the room was that there was no tea making facilities but I can't imagine that being common in American hotels as they put their kettles on the job rather than plugging them in. Was a shame to not have a cup of tea in the morning but I soon got over it. The customer service is outstanding. We had a problem with our safe and within 5 minutes it was fixed thanks to the front desk staff and the engineers. Also, the staff in he restaurant were the loveliest severs we had the whole time. Food was well priced and delicious! The location is one of the best bits. Only a five minute walk from Times Square and luckily for us we could see the New Year's Eve ball drop from our bedroom window! There's so many places to eat around the hotel and a wide range of subways within 5-10 minute walks to allow access around Manhattan. I rate this hotel very highly and I've recommended it to so many people already. If and when I go back, this hotel will be my first choice. ",,Sarah W,13,5.0

But....so noisy. We were on 20th floor and street noise was just awful all night. I was cold as the only blanket is a thin fleece. No comforter or extra in the closet so had to turn up heat higher than I prefer for sleeping. I try never to stay in this neighborhood but took advantage of a great rate promotion. When we arrived I had prepaid for the room but did not have that particular credit card with me. This was an issue despite me having ID, a reservation receipt and other credit cards. It that led to us standing at the front desk for what felt like forever until they said ok. Then I was advised of a $26 a day resort fee. Oops missed that charge somewhere when booking. Have never paid a resort fee in NYC hotel before. They offered 10%off their $24 breakfast but any idiot knows better than to eat breakfast in your NYC hotel. There are diners like Galaxy within a block or plenty of other reasonable options within two blocks and a Starbucks across the street. It's a good location if you are going to a show or have interest in Times Square. It's small room yes but you know that when booking. I've had huge rooms and small rooms in NYC. We found this adequate for the two of us. In the morning people were in the hallway at 8am sitting and talking on their cellphone on speaker like they were at home. WTH people do you not realize there are people sleeping behind all those doors? This behavior baffles me and I finally had to go ask the woman to have her conversation elsewhere.

This is so any raw emotion (good or bad) has time to dissipate before I put down my feelings.My family and I (5 people in total) stayed here in October 2016, during school half term. The RIU was one of only a few hotels that offered a family room that could accommodate us all in one room.Firstly, the good:The hotel is in a great location, just two blocks from the centre of Times Square and all the bustle and atmosphere that it offers. Times Square itself is something you have to experience but not for too long. If like me, you don't like crowds then you'll be happy just to pass through. But if you're in New York to soak up the buzz, then the RIU is a good place to stay.The hotel is modern and clean with a bar serving great beers and OK food (more on that later). Plus there's a small coffee shop for pastries and cakes if you don't feel like a full breakfast. It is small though and you might not get a seat.I can't really think of any other good points so I'll move on to the bad.Room size. Really? For a family of five? We expected something that had at least a bit of room to move in, but once our cases were on the floor (no stand was provided) there was literally nowhere to stand.This was not going to work for us, so I spoke to reception who upgraded us to a larger room for our remaining four nights, but not without relieving me of a further $700 for the benefit. This room was much better - two separate rooms and a bathroom with a proper door instead of a frosted glass window. No child wants to see a silhouette of their dad on the toilet.So in the end we got a more suitable room, but they made me pay a lot for it.The restaurant. Breakfast is the usual buffet affair, with all of the expected components in metal dishes for you to help yourself to. Not a great experience when they ran out of eggs, bread, sausages and bacon at regular intervals. They were eventually topped up but it mean that we ate our breakfast in separate sprints instead of together.At dinner (we only ate dinner there once) the menu looked OK but the service was disastrous. We were seated and then ignored for 15 minutes. Eventually our waitress took a drinks order but refused to take our food order until she had brought our drinks, even though we had already chosen. Our drinks then sat at the bar for a further 10 minutes before I eventually stood up to retrieve them myself. Once we placed our food order, it took 45 minutes to arrive - plus they got half the order wrong and it had to be sent back. All of this was punctuated with a mixture of vacant stares and borderline hostility from our waitress who looked like she would rather be anywhere else but serving us. And no, the restaurant was not busy - it was no more than 30% of capacity.When we left, I booked a taxi with the concierge to take us to JFK. ""Five thirty"" I told him. At five thirty we were in the lobby and I spoke to the concierge. Long story short, the taxi didn't arrive until quarter past six. You could blame this on the taxi firm, but from the way he reacted, I got a feeling that no one had actually ordered our cab.Ironically, this extra time ended up quite useful, because they lost our luggage and it took them over half an hour to find it.On a final note - I paid a $100 deposit upon checking in which was supposed to be deducted from my final incedentals bill. It came to over $900, so I should have paid $800. In all the commotion at check out I didn't check my bill, expecting it to be correct, and it was only when I returned to England that I discovered that the $100 I had already paid was not deducted. I've tried to speak to the hotel to get my $100 back but got nowhere and have given up.","Manchester, United Kingdom","rayk1011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",31,2.0

Being “just” a city hotel room is not a bad thing. I sort of knew what I would be getting when I made the reservation. At first though, when noticing no carpet in the hallways or in the room, I thought, O boy! This is not the Marriott Marquis for sure. But, I certainly was saving some money in comparison with other nearby hotels. And, what I found was that I was not at all dissatisfied with anything. The hotel is brand new construction, it was clean, bed comfy, shower was great, room was quiet except for some noisy door slammers every once in a while, a great view with the huge floor to ceiling windows and location, location, location. I only got the breakfast buffet there one morning which was fine and typical for NYC. Only down side for me was no expedited checkout procedure or if there was, unfortunately I was not aware of it. Upon needing to checkout in the morning I found a lot of people waiting in line for a desk clerk so they could get a final bill. I could not wait for a long time and eventually had to just ask someone behind the desk to please check me out but I could not get a final bill in hand. This hotel serves its purpose well.

We try to visit the city as often as we can. We booked the RIU because we are RIU class members and had received a coupon code for the booking. We have been to two other RIU hotels/resorts but in Mexico. Because we had loved the RIU hospitality during our trips to Mexico, we gave it a shot.The RIU Times Square is fairly new and, therefore, clean and up to date. The staff was polite and efficient. We arrived much earlier than check in time. We had traveled by train and did not want to carry our overnight bags so we figured we'd drop them off at BS, go get some lunch, walk around a bit and get back to RIU at check in time for our room. Well, we were pleasantly surprised when they said that, if we didn't mind not getting a high floor room with a possible view, we could have a room immediately. We don't spend a lot of time in our hotel room when we go away so having a room early was more important then the high floor with a possible view and we took it. As I said before, we visit NYC often and, therefore, know the view well. We were also given free bottled water at check-in.Our room had two double beds pushed together into a king plus a love-seat that opened into a bed. We had a mini fridge and a wall mounted tv. The bathroom was a bit different but so RIU (and if you have visited any other RIU hotels you'll know what I mean!). The shower walls were opaque but, because of the light in the bathroom, the silhouette of the showering person would be very visible from the outside. We've experienced several odd bathrooms designs during our history with RIU so we're no longer surprised. LOLOther than that, decent size room compared to the smaller size rooms typical to NYC. Of course, the RIU is not a bargain priced hotel and, even with a coupon, our rate was not cheap!The lobby of the hotel is very pretty and a bit exotic. There is a bar/lounge on one side of the lobby and a coffee shop on the other. I believe their restaurant is next to the bar but we didn't eat there so I don't have any info on it.Location of RIU Times Square is perfect if you want to visit Times Square, see a Broadway play, etc. We like to walk the city and, the weekend in October when we went, was just gorgeous! We ended up walking up to Central Park and down to Madison Square Garden. We also saw a Broadway show and did a lot of other fun things.All in all, it was a great time and RIU TS was perfect for our visit!

Location was very good, very much in the heart of Times Square, easy and close to all public transport, restaurants and activities. The hotel had a nice atmosphere when walking into the foyer and check in was smooth and easy. The room was very difficult to spend 5 nights in with that many people. People have said that NYC hotels are small but seriously we had two double beds that were about an inch apart and then had the pull out which was separated by a bedside. The floor space was so minimal and our three suitcases (3 week trip) took up any space we did have. THE BATHROOM!! What a major stuff up that is. The wall is frosted glass and although you cannot see all the details, at night with the light on not too much is left to the imagination. As if it wasn't hard enough sharing one small room with children for 5 nights you couldn't even escape to the bathroom for a bit of privacy. We got around this by showering with the lights off which wasn't ideal. As for the shower itself, that was really nice, roomy and good water pressure with a nice big shower head, although water did leak and wet the floor in the room. On the first night we had a problem with our electricity buzzing very loudly. Was annoying enough for us to call down to reception to which they said they would send someone up, nobody ever came but luckily after the first night it didn't do it again. We ate at the restaurant for dinner on one night and found it to be a cheap feed but certainly nothing to call home about, still though, it only cost us about $70 to feed the five of us so we were not complaining. If I was ever return to NYC (which I intend on NEVER doing) I would not come back to this hotel. We choose this place purely based on the fact that anything else in the same price range had sold out so if you have a family and have the options I would recommend not shortlisting this one. However I'm sure it would be ok for a couple or single, actually a couple might really enjoy that bathroom wall ;) ","Brisbane Region, Australia","jaytesh22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane Region, Australia</strong>",4,3.0

We got the shuttle bus from the airport to Port Authority bus terminal and it was only 4 blocks from here and even with big suitcases it was very easy. Check in went smoothly and the hotel leaves a good first impression. Our room was at a corner of the hotel so our view was really good as we had floor to ceiling windows along two full walls of the room(however if scared of heights you may not enjoy this quite as much). The room is compact but it was what I expected from a hotel in new York so I found this to be alright and it did have a lovely walk in shower, the bathroom did have all round frosted walls so you could see the shadows when in the shower, I never found this a negative however some may find it a bit strange. When leaving the hotel you are only a few blocks from the centre of times square and in the other direction you can walk straight along to the pier where you can pick up the water taxi and various boat rides. We walked everywhere from this hotel and even late at night it was busy and easy enough to walk back to. We never ate in the hotel so I couldn't comment on the restaurant however the coffee in the adjoining coffee shop was very nice each morning.

In the first night at 2am, our fire alarm went off but that was not the end of it, the manager came over the very loud speakers (placed in your individual hotel room and hallway) to explain what was going on not once but for 10 consecutive minutes in 2 languages. I am fine with 1 or 2 times (it was obviously a false alarm) but to repeat oneself for that long was very extreme. I have small kids so once they are up, we are all up!!!!!! The other thing was that I tried using the concierge 3 times, and the line was ridiculously long. I would have thought for at least this time of the year, being so busy, there would have been at least 2 people helping. Each time a I tried asking the bell boy or even the front desk when they were not busy for simple questions as where to eat, they of course referred me to the very long line of the concierge.

Lobby bathrooms were nice and rain shower was nice. The price was right, paying $299 for a king room of normal NYC size in high Dec time. And location is great. So you wonder what's wrong.

There wasn't a lighted clock so when you wake up in the middle of the night because it so hot with no covers on, you can't see a time. I know, look at your phone but I don't keep it next to me. Also, there was a flashing white light at the ceiling, part of an alarm I am sure, but once you see it's there, it was annoying. Lastly, there is no coffeemaker.

Lastly, there wasn't nearly enough room for people to sit in the lobby area and bags were overflowing the check area.

In general, the whole staff is very eficiente, polite and warm welcoming. However, there is a very unfortunate point about the place.Every day, in end of the afternoon, a supervisor knocks at every room to check whether the room has been clean and everything is OK. However, this is how they do it. The person knocks on your door once. One second later, he or she knocks a second time. Even if you say loudly that you will open the door in just a moment, the supervisor simply enters your room. It takes few seconds. Most times it happened, I was at the desk working on my laptop and, at the first knock, got up from the chair and sprang to the door saying I was going to open. I didn't work. They opened the door before me every single time.The only way for them not to do it is this. Around 4 PM, hang the ""Do not disturb"" sign on your knob. However, it is plain ridiculous that you, the guest, must remember at all costs to put a sign on your door at 4:00 PM every single day not to have your room invaded. Otherwise, you may be caught naked or in whatever intimate circumstances. Knocking at someone's door requires minimum respect and common sense. It's not a matter of sophistication, the problem has to do with minimun politeness As for other aspects, I have no complaint. Actually, the staff deserve compliments for their very good work. But the flaw I described above is so outrageous and so systematic that it deeply compromised my enjoying my stay.P.S: I complained about the problem, but it simply went on.

Enough has been said about the location, but it really is a great one: just far enough removed from Times Square yet close enough to have the benefit of a TON of restaurants around you. Really, anything you could want to eat from fast food to high end stuff is nearby, which is awesome. Plus plenty of bars and watering holes, not to mention coffee shops and everything in between. And all the theaters! Positives of the room include that it is new and has floor to ceiling windows. I'm not sure if there is truly a bad view in the place. I was on the 9th floor, a relatively low floor, and it was still a nice view. I love that there is no carpet in the rooms: carpet is gross in hotels. Also the in room chair and sleeper sofa were of a vinyl type material: much easier to clean than cloth. Usually I will not sit on chairs or couches in a hotel room. The room was also well sized. I hate it when people say ""big for NYC standards"" but it really was; I had a ""family room"" with two doubles pushed together and a sofa sleeper and it would have been a decent sized room anywhere. I definitely did not feel cramped in the least. I have been in much smaller rooms. Not sure what the size is of their other room types though. Also had a generously sized mini fridge. Wifi was probably the best I've had in a hotel, very strong and fast signal. That being said, unfortunately there were a few cleanliness issues with the room. There were quite a few stray hairs that were not mine. I get that it's hard for housekeeping to get every last piece of hair cleaned up, but there was hair on the decorative pillows and little bedspread thing (gross). Hairs in the bathroom and a big wad of hair near the bathroom sliding door. The bedding is all white, which is only nice if it is kept up scrupulously. It was not in my room, the bed skirt had a stain on it, and it was hard to ignore. Gross again. And the aforesaid awesome windows had finger and hand prints.....all over them. I am forgiving of a thing or two as cleaning rooms is hard, but these were obvious, glaring things that were not addressed. I am not usually someone who whines about the lack of a coffee maker in the room but I did find myself wishing there were either a coffee maker, or at least room service to get coffee. Instead, you have no choice but to venture out of the room to get coffee. Also, comments about the lack of privacy in the bathrooms are absolutely true. I was alone so it didn't matter, but beware: the bathrooms leave nothing to the imagination. Whoever else is in the room will be able to hear and probably see whatever is going on in there. I stayed at a Riu property in the Dominican Republic and it was the same type of thing. Overall, you could do a lot worse but I'd probably only stay here again if I could find a deal on the room, like I did this time.","Chicago, Illinois","SunLvr101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",38,3.0

We even walked to see two plays, no need to take subway or taxi. The check-in wasn't the greatest..

Since we booked a suite I thought the hotel might offer something for suite guest. I was told about the gym and there restaurant & grab & go Deli. Nothing extra for suite guest. I found out later if you book a suite there is a concierge room on the 26th floor . We were told it opened at 7:00 AM, it didn't open until 8:00. I asked what to expect, we were told coffee and maybe a Danish, that's it. We were surprise to find a lot more, pastries, meat & chesses, fresh fruit & yogurt. In the evening there was wine & red wine, plus more food.  Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so we left our luggage with the hotel, which worked beautifully. We came back before dinner, picked up our luggage & room key. That's when I found out from a different girl that we could go to the 26th floor and use our room key to get into the concierge room for suite guest. If you arrive and there is a long line at check in, leave your luggage and go explore. Don't waste your time standing in line.

Upon checkout we decided to use the luggage service (also included in the facility fee), but were advised by the man running the service that they were very overloaded with luggage and if we decided to use it we should allow at least 30 minutes when we return for him to find our bags. Given we were only leaving our bags for 30-45 minutes while we grabbed some lunch that was clearly not a reasonable service.

Had a room on the 18th floor which kept the inevitable noise from Times Square to a minimum... we were both able to get good nights sleep.Bathroom was very clean and tidy - no bath facilities in our room but this did not bother us.In terms of the amenities in the room - there was a (empty) mini fridge that was perfect for us as we were able to chill food (mostly chocolate!!) and drinks that we had bought throughout our days in the city. However, we were both very disappointed that there was no hot drink making facility in the room - no coffee machine which we both thought would have finished off the room. We know that there are NUMEROUS places to purchase coffee in NYC but sometimes, all you need is a cuppa in bed before you start your day off! Nevertheless, this hotel was a great hotel and in perfect location for all the main sites in New York City. Of note - it was my birthday the weekend before we arrived and as a treat, the hotel left a small complimentary box of chocolates as a gift. A very thoughtful gift that was very much appreciated - thank you!Would definitely return to this hotel - its reasonably priced and great location.","Wales, United Kingdom","TheWhites1116</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wales, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

The check in clerk was a bit 'frosty' rather than welcoming after a transatlantic flight. We were a little early for check in but were promised an email (?) to let us know when our room was ready. Nothing heard & on our return at 3:45pm found the room was ready but simply hadn't kept the promise.Aside from others already mentioning the odd shower privacy arrangement (not a problem in our case) the room on the 16th floor was good & we had a nice city view - noise was OK from the street at night. Other guests have noted the leaky showers which we 'plugged' with a towel. An unexplained pool of water appeared by the front door after we had showered & can only assume it originated from the air con (which ceased to work after our first night, leaving the room quite warm but tolerable - it is November!).The lack of the promised bottle of water in the room was again minor but having left a note for the maid for 2 days asking for it, only for it to be ignored, was annoying -front desk provided it on asking.On a couple of occasions, we did not get a full set of towels - again minor inconvenience but accumulative in my overall opinion of the hotel, considering it worked out at £300 per night to stay there.On checking out, there was a disparity in the total bill from what we were expecting, due in part to this 'use of gym' & 'free' wi-fi package that seems to be compulsory but what annoyed me more was that the card we had used at check in seemingly had $1900 earmarked and we were then told it wasn't acceptable Further, it would take up to a week to have the 'earmark' removed! I paid without problem using a different card - very odd - & was left wondering whether I'd get charged the room bill on both cards.Collecting our cases from storage early afternoon, the friendly bellhop (?) offered to get us a car for $73, all in (ie including tip & tolls), which was only a very little difference to what we paid on the way in. I checked with him a couple of times that it was all inclusive. On driving to the airport in a very nice sedan, the driver asked how much we were told it would be & on telling her she said that didn't include a tip. I suggested she took it up with the named bellhop. We also took a longer than usual route through areas that avoided the tolls so something ain't quite right there.Next time we're in NYC we'll be looking elsewhere to stay","Canterbury, United Kingdom","BenR925</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canterbury, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

It's just between Times Square and 9th so you sit between all the food and bright lights NYC has to offer. The street is quieter than Times Sq but you're just steps away. Hamilton is just across 8th of you're that lucky. Trains are easily accessible here. You can walk to the theaters, to the park and Rockefeller quite easily. The hotel staff are friendly. Check in was quick and they held our bags until 3:00. Great view of the Hudson. The Grab and Go off the lobby is perfect for coffee and pastry in the morning. They also have protein snack packs and my sister said the hard boiled egg was fresh. The room is modern....stick your key in for lights to work and art work. There is a glass wall for the bathroom with no privacy. The room literally is a rectangle with a glass sq as you enter the room. You can see a persons shadow while they're in the shower and the glass door simply slides. None of us cared for this idea and when my sister took a shower at 6:45 the whole room lit up. Also the shower tends to get water on the floor. Put towels down or you'll slip. The shower head is waterfall or handheld. It's a bit tricky for some. Turn it back to get waterfall....forward for handheld. This is the only reason I would not stay here again. The lack of privacy was too much for us.....my sisters hated the shower. If you choose to stay check out Orso across the street for dinner and Island Burger for lunch. I'll put Orso on my NYC go to restaurants for pre/post theater dinner. Island Burger wasn't as good as the reviews but a fun little burger joint. You're just in Hells Kitchen so eating won't be your problem.

We figured we'd lower the temperature and go out for a late bite and it will be cooler when we got back. We also noticed the frosted glass shower where you can pretty much see the person showering and the two beds that were pushed together. So I figured, ok no showers and we're sleeping with our kids. We returned around 11:30pm and it was still hot. We called for maintenance. And they said it was because we had the air on and not on auto. That it should be cold in about 30 minutes. I seriously doubted it was because it was on ""on"". But we waited and waited. By then kids were asleep and at 1am I woke up because it was just too hot and my son was sweating. My husband went down to complain again. They gave him a key to another room. I was trying to gather all our stuff and was woke up the kids to head toward the elevator. The maintenance man stopped us and said our air was turned off downstairs and he fixed it. To just wait 30 minutes in our room and open window to let cold air in. Ummm opening a window in NYC by Times Square won't exactly get you a good nights sleep. We tried but it was useless. We waited and again woke up at 3am when it was simply unbearable and everyone was sweating. I called and said i need that room they offered to switch us to. The front desk told me ""but you declined it"". I told them I did not decline. They told me to go back because it was fixed and I was not going to stay in room Any longer. Again I woke up my kids (6 and 9) and dragged them half awake to other room. The other room had two separate beds a non see through shower and was not hot. Too bad it took so long to get us in the room. I was so tired and put the do not disturb sign on our door hoping to sleep in. All was well until 8:30am when someone came knocking on our door. And wouldn't stop knocking until we answered. He wanted to come in to see if shower was working because there were complaints yesterday it wasn't working. And that water flowed everywhere. I told him we just got in at 3am. I put do not disturb. My kids are exhausted. I'mNot letting him in to work on the shower! He left and I thought, guess we won't be taking shower either! I was so aggregated at that point I went downstairs to see if I could talk to manager. I did, but honestly she looked very disinterested in what I was telling her. She said well I'm sorry that happened. But since this is your only night here there's nothing I can do. Here's the email address to customer service. You can let them know what happened.

I read the nearly all the reviews (good and bad). Upon entry, my friend and I were greeted as we entered a very busy reception and a chaotic luggage check in service. Our check in with Angel was prompt and courteous. We checked our luggage into the locker with a very hard-working young man. Sadly, he was in great need of assistance as the set-up for the luggage locker is poorly conceptualized for the amount of people checking in and out.We returned later in the day and went up to our room #1802. We had reserved a deluxe family room with two full beds and a sofa. It was perfect for our needs. Clean, minimalistic and with a somewhat decent view. We decided to take a nap when we heard a loud noise coming from above our room. I called reception and was told maintenance was being done and it shouldn't be much longer. 2 hours later the noise sounded like a jack hammer and I could barely hear the receptionist on the phone when I called again. She did inform me they would be working the next day as well and I said while the room was lovely, the situation was unacceptable. The workers stopped for the day and we slept in the room changing to another in the morning. Reception profusely apologized for the inconvenience and moved us to the 27th floor with a view of the Hudson. Overall, our room was comfortable, clean and perfect for what we needed. Location was great for staging our daily NYC events. The staff was helpful from reception, to bellman and the greeter who arranged our taxi's. The interior was modern and sleek. Enjoyed the aesthetics of it. Never made it to Fashion or the little grab n go.

This included, trip, taxes gratuity and tolls. On reaching the airport 1 hour and 40 minutes later, the driver requested $83 and gratuity. When I told him the Bell Boy gave us a price of $75 all in, he said the extra $8 was for using a card and the gratuity was not included. I paid the $83 and said he would have to talk to the Bell Boy for the gratuity.All in all, the hotel was disappointing as it was only opened this year and the staff was un friendly.

Service was sadly lacking with a painful check-in procedure and staff that would rather continue a personal conversation whilst we stood like lemons waiting to be attended to. We had a drink in the hotel bar and the tonic out of the gun was flat. Rather than replacing it immediately, the barman squirted some more into another glass to demonstrate that it wasn't flat but it was!! At £10+ a drink I do not expect to have my word doubted in this way. On check out we were told that the hotel was very busy so we could not have a late check out (we were not due to fly until 8pm). However, if we were prepared to pay an additional $40 plus tax the hotel wouldn't be so busy and our request could be accommodated! Didn't like the feeling of being clipped at every opportunity and certainly didn't feel particularly well looked after. Even when we collected our bags from the hotel storage area, we were shown into the room and told to find our bags despite having been given tickets for them. Finally at 14.45 we were told the restaurant was closed for lunch and yet it states clearly on the hotel information that lunch is served until 15.00 every day.

Whilst security in a city like New York is important, the hotel security should not behave like bouncers at a night club handling drunk and disorderly patrons. We are after all paying guests.

Don't get me wrong it's in a great location, mins from Times Square and the price is decent for that. The lobby is beautiful and modern, we landed at 11am and check in wasn't until 3 and they're pretty strict about check in times ( absolutely no way for you to check in before 3, us and a dozen of other people literally just sat and waited awhile) they do let you check in your luggage though so we did that and walked around Times Square for a bit. Once we finally were checked in (which the ladies at the front desk arnt the nicest by the way) we were having trouble finding our room on the 29th floor, we made our way to the main elevator banks and were confused when there was no option for the 29th floor, so went back to the front desk and she told us the other elevators which we were ok..where? She seemed annoyed and pointed behind her. There was ONE elevator that took you to all floors including the top ones, which by the way takes forever. It was basically meant for staff members which was odd. The room was nice but quite small, which was okay we were barely in the room anyways. Floors were dusty upon check in, so we definitely didn't walk bare foot. We stood 3 days and the floors never seemed to be cleaned. Now this leads me to check out day. My husband had an alarm on his phone for 8am, he went to grab his phone once the alarm went off and it fell between the wall and nightstand when he reached between the gap to retrieve his phone he felt something squishy, now I'm gonna let your mind wonder and figure out what it was. Immediately he figured it out without retrieving it just his phone, all I heard him say was ""oh my god are you kidding me"" before he ran into the bathroom to wash his hands. He went down to the front desk explaining what he had found and they sent up a staff member to see, which I'm more then sure they found it too. We were so disgusted at this point we didn't know what to do, the manager said she couldn't do any rate adjustments to call Expedia since we booked with them but PAID IN PERSON at the hotel ( makes no sense) so we called Expedia and they said we'd have to take it up with the hotel since they are the ones who I paid.

Unfortunately that never happened, even though the hotel was not even close to fully booked. The room was very clean and modern, though very small.

The bathroom and bed area are separated by a glass frosted wall, so that in the middle of the night when someone uses the bathroom, the light brightens the whole sleeping area. Another problem with that design is that anyone taking a shower has his/her silhouette in full view of anyone in the room, not a pleasant experience for those who may be sharing a room on a business trip.I'm also disappointed that the hotel has no water fill up station for eco-friendly bottle water users. I has to go to the bar to fill up our water bottles, or buy disposable water bottles from the convenience store. No complimentary coffee or tea in the morning either.

ROOMS: Better than I expected. Nice spacious clean room with air conditioning. Beds were comfy. Large led tv. Fridge. Lovely view. Nice decor. Loved the drench shower. Yes there was a small leak but nothing the towel mat couldn't handle. Hotel was well soundproofed as we didn't hear any noise from outside when window was shut. Plenty of lifts available to we never had to wait for one. Free wifi also internet access with computers that were located in reception with access to a printer which was handy as I needed to print out our boarding passes for our return flight home. We didn't eat here so I can't comment on that but we had a drink in the bar and found that quiet expensive. Location was excellent. Soon as you stepped out of the hotel Times Square was a few minutes walk. Plenty of places to eat in the area. On check out I got my $50 back and we could store our luggage which the bell boy sorts for you as we had a late flight. He also sorted us a taxi back to JFK right from the hotel doorstep which was handy. Overall an excellent stay and would defiantly recommend this hotel. I would certainly stay here again if I return to the Big Apple one day. Service was excellent.","Darlington, United Kingdom","DarloRunner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darlington, United Kingdom</strong>",47,5.0

The room is small but as this was our 1st time in NYC I cannot compare room sizes other places. THE BAD:Yes your shower will leak and flood into the room if extra towels are not ordered.There are 2 bottles of water supplied and this is all you will get for your entire stay. With the price paid for the room 2x complimentary bottles of water each day is not a big ask. I have never stayed at a motel where laundry has to be delivered to reception where you are greeted with a sneer and then you have to chase them up to get it back and collect from Reception. We learnt our $100 lesson the hard way and then got the same amount done for $9 at a laundry around the corner.It seems the place has been built on the cheap as our room already had paint pealing on the roof, the leaking shower, no clock, fittings not fitted properly, no drawers in the cupboard.THE UGLY:I'm not sure if this was an NYC thing or they have fitted a cheap fire alarm as they tested it every morning at around 9am for the 1st week . No chance of a sleep in.There is no care factor. They took a $200 room deposit (no dramas) but then 2 days later took another $300 without even bothering to contact us. I had to go chase them to find out what it was. Then the rude girl at reception didn't believe me & I had to actually show her my statement to prove it! Some of the staff seem to need a real attitude adjustmentOverall we would not return as we had been totally spoilt by a competitor brand motel only a few days before in West Hollywood so our next stay in NYC will be with that brand. I'm sure there will be a generic response to this but after comparing the 2 Brands we will never stay at a RIU again.",,Marra400,18,3.0

I don't know if happened when it was stored but it was not ripped when we dropped it off. I should have said something but my husband didn't want to make a scene. The rooms are small but very clean and modern. The hallways are very dreary. They look like a prison with the heavy doors and drab color walls. We were on the 22nd floor and had a decent view.

Over by your door is a slot you put your key card into and that works the electricity. The only other issue we had was that the shower door was almost impossible to open. It was stuck.

However, the problems started on our first morning when we were woken up (jet lagged) at around 8am by a fire alarm. We ran out into the corridor with other confused guests in their underwear. It stopped about 10 seconds later with no announcement and we went back to bed with a nice dose of adrenaline. Two other mornings we were woken up by intercom announcements before 9am about fire alarm tests. So out of the 5 nights we stayed, 3 we were rudely woken up by this system.Having consulted the front desk about this, we were told this was NYC fire regulations and that the FDNY can come in any time to test the alarms. If this is true or not, I cannot say, but I've stayed in New York many times before for weeks at a time and have never experienced this before. If anything the management need to be working with the Fire department to do these at more sociable hours. To top it off, the front desk did not even offer an apology and were almost hostile in their approach - always something that puts me off a hotel.So all in all a pleasant place to stay, but let down by early fire alarms and a poor front desk service.

So to start, the lobby was gorgeous, very well decorated, gave me high hopes for the hotel. The staff were very matter of fact, not pleasant nor displeasant at this point. They just did their thing and sent me on my way. I got out of the elevators and as walking to room all I could think of was I was in a dorm, or office building. When I got to the room, it was bright and airy as others mentioned. I had a double bed room as it was what was available. the two beds were pushed together. (see photo) I suppose if you were sharing the room you could redecorate but who wants to do that. As for this room I would not recommend it for any more then a single person or a close couple. The bathroom had a frosted glass separating the shower and the room, with the light source coming from beyond. So what does that mean? Shadow dancing. You can see everything that is happening in the shower if you were sharing the room. On top of that they left 6 shampoo, 6 conditioner, 6 wash and 6 lotions every day, very bizarre. There was hair left in my room on the floor from a previous occupant, and although the hotel is new, they painted it a flat white, which in the small rooms is already showing massive signs of suitcase rubbing against it. Pros: -Great location, 5 minutes from times square, 5 minutes to hell's Kitchen, just a few minutes to the subway-beautiful lobby-nice new bright buildingCons:-a double bed with the beds together-extremely utilitarian and sterile feeling-hair that wasn't mine- lots of scuffs and signs of wear for a new hotel So the big question, would I stay here again.

Unlike almost every other hotel in New York and the US in general, where the mail room will gladly hold packages for guests until their arrival free of charge, this Riu has recently implemented a new policy where they return packages to the sender if the guest in question will not be arriving within the next three days. If the guest in question is scheduled to arrive within this short time period they will charge her or him five dollars for each day they hold the package. As it is almost impossible to ensure the exact date a package will arrive, this new and surprisingly unfriendly policy means that those of us who like to take advantage of Internet shopping when we travel to the US will now have to do without.I am not sure if this has become a universal policy at all Riu hotels or just this one in particular.","Mexico City, Mexico","Jerome L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mexico City, Mexico</strong>",9,2.0

My wife and I travel to New York often and are seldom in our hotel room. The Riu Plaza New York Times Square was so inviting that we made use of the hotel's cozy bar, lovely modern patio, coffee shop and restaurant. We found the prices for meals / drinks a little high but this was offset by the unbelievably reasonable nightly rate for such nice accommodations. I believe we paid $175 / night...an unbelievable rate for New York, even for the most basic accommodations.Location: The property is on the corner of 8th Ave and 46th Street, right in the heart of the theater district and only a short block from the heart of Times Square. Surprisingly, the street is quiet most times of the day. The Rooms: Comfy beds, fresh, modern decor, floor to ceiling windows for lots of light, The bathroom area is spotless and has a roomy modern walk in shower. There was a small desk area and a large flat screen TV. We could not have been more pleased.As was shared, my wife and I are in New York often, and as such, we are aware of the range of prices for rooms in a great location. The Riu Plaza New York Times Square had the best room rate and location. The service was excellent. We could only assume that the great price (booked through Booking.com) was due to the property drawing attention to itself as it breaks into the New York market.

Purchased theatre tickets from the cut price ""tkts"" centre in Times Square which offers 50% discounts and all but the latest shows (Hamilton) were available during our stay.You can walk most to most places from the hotel - Rockefeller, Empire State and 5th Avenue shops are all less than 30 mins away. The Grey Line tour centre is also just around the corner so you can purchase tickets and get on the open top bus in 2 minutes. We took the uptown and downtown 48 hours hop on / off pass which was great to visit the likes of Central Park, Guggenheim and the 9/11 memorial within the financial district.The hotel provided excellent buffet breakfasts from 7 through to 11am which really sets you up for the day ahead and you are spoilt for choice with restaurants of all descriptions within a few minutes walk of the hotel. The hotel does a great value lunch menu at $12.50 if you are around.The hotel is very new and maintenance work is still ongoing here and there. Our junior suite room was very clean and bright with a king size bed and sofa bed. Both were pretty comfy and we had plenty of space for our needs. The shower was great, a very swish glass affair with lots of room. The room also had a large whirlpool bath which we never used and to be honest it was a waste of space but we did try it on the last day but the motor was faulty - not running for more than a few seconds.One other minor niggle, one blackout curtain wouldn't quite close so let light in early in the morning. We did report it but it was never fixed so take a clothes peg to clip it together! The sink unit had obviously had a serious water leak at some point with the wooden surround being badly swollen. A shame given the age of the hotel but some of the workmanship did leave a bit to be desired and the furniture was somewhat light and flimsy. On the plus side, the air con was cool and very quiet.We did buy an explorer pass at the hotel which got us into 7 different attractions at a reduced rate - very worthwhile, especially as it allowed us to bypass the normal ticket queues. Just look for the prepaid lines. They also arranged our return airport transfer by a company called volatour, we booked a 3 door sedan but he turned up in a sleek white and very long limo at no extra cost. A great end to the holiday.Big Tip, NYC does not do travellers cheques. We had a few left from a trip to Orlando where everyone accepted them but here Bank of America and Wells Fargo were the only 2 places we eventually found to exchange them.You can ask for a late check out on the morning of departure but there is no guarantee, we did get a complimentary 1 hour which meant a 1PM check out.Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here for its location and style. Just need to fix the teething troubles, minor niggles and sort out the maintenance issues - it could be almost perfect.","Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom","Richard F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

We were greeted by a person at the lounge area that directed us to a table. As soon as we sat down, they moved us to another seat because ""that table was not ready. ""We then were visited by our waitress who kindly gave us menus (but one of the menus contained simply the shell of the envelope and didn't have the menu details. )We asked her details about foods because we have food allergies. She was unfamiliar with the menu as it was her first day! We immediate asked to speak with the chef who did come our. The chef understood our allergies and our needs, and our waitress was there to take the order. However, they got 3 of the four orders wrong. We asked for the two steals to be medium well. They were both rare. We asked for roasted potatoes to be roasted with olive oil (instead of canola) and of course they were not. My wife's potatoes were supposed to come with a pesto and they didn't. We showed the waitress the steaks as they were far from medium well. We then worried about whether the potatoes used olive oil instead of canola. She went back to the chef and came back smiling in approval that they had used canola (completely unaware that we wanted it to NOT HAVE CANOLA). Then we asked for the chef to come out and look at the steaks. He did. He acknowledged that they were FAR from medium well. He then said that they were quite busy back in the kitchen and that with a new waitress they had a made a mistake and that they would correct it. So, he took the steaks back while my wife and son finished their foods. They returned the other two meals (the steaks) OVER DONE (burnt)!My daughter couldn't finish hers as it was too burnt. When we went to pay, a manager approached us an apologized. She offered a 25% discount. However, when they brought the bill, it didn't have a discount. She then corrected it and I have her my card, but the card processing machine wasn't working. I literally had to follow her to the hotel lobby to complete the awful transaction.

""We overbook,"" was the answer they gave us since the room had been given away. They offered to put us in two separate rooms. The room we had was a so-called suite for three people. We took the two rooms. We would have been better off keeping the two rooms since the ""suite"" for three people was the same size the one room for two with a couch thrown in to sleep on making it impossible to maneuver in the space that was left. They did give us vouchers for breakfast; it is $24 per person for an all you can eat buffet. It wasn't great, to say the least. And later we discovered a restaurant at the port authority that was similar except it looked better for $15. When you have a room with more than one person, you must be aware that the bathroom are translucent, and you hear everything that goes on in them with an echo effect on top it. So if anyone gets up to go in the night, you will know from the light and the noise. The only good thing about this place is its location and believe me; they make you pay out the wazoo for it. They are better and more comfortable hotels in Manhattan for the same money. I recommend that you go there. The quality is a little like a very expensive dorm room.","Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland","Robert R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland</strong>",9,2.0

Surely this was something that could have been foreseen at some point within the preceding 24 hours but no attempt had been made to forewarn us. We were told, by TWO staff members, that we would get a credit on our card for this night. When we didn't see the credit on our account after two weeks, we contacted the hotel. They denied that anyone had made this promise.They offered a complimentary night for our next visit. When I explained that it would be unlikely that we would be back in NYC soon, they replied very curtly that this was all they would offer (along with a list of the restrictions of that offer). For a family with two small, jet-lagged children, this inconvenience led to many more inconveniences which seemed a little more tolerable with the knowledge that we would get compensation.

I don't think I have ever experienced a more lacklustre and shambolic greeting - there was clearly a problem with our room, but no-one actually thought to talk to us clearly and directly and we were left standing for what seemed like an age feeling very uncomfortable and lacking any reassurance that all was going to be ok. There was no attempt to 'sell' their solution to us, and although we were given a free breakfast to compensate us for the fact that what we had booked (nine months ago!) was not available, I had to suggest (quite forcefully) that this might be a nice move, they clearly weren't going to offer it. The breakfast was fine, but nothing exciting - just like the entire place really. Rooms small, but clean and comfortable. Nice toiletries and generous provision of them.

The lobby is beautiful. The service clerk was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I had requested a lower floor and they wanted to put me on the 27th floor. So I asked them if they had anything lower. He searched and searched until he successfully found something on the 15th floor. That was just fine with me. Then I had something that I needed cut off of my wrist and another gentlemen came running over with a pair of clippers and proceeded to cut it off of me. They were great and very helpful. The hotel room was very nice. It had a very clean smell to it, the room was good size, the bathroom was full of toiletries, clean towels and with very plush bed spreads and pillows. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is on Time Square so it is so easy to just step outside and get involved in all of the activities that were going on. Make sure you visit the Hershey Store for some of their great Candy. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, anything that you need just ask them and it is yours. I only have one issue. The Buffet. We went to breakfast and the waitress wanted to know if we were on the Free breakfast list. We told her no, so she took us up a few stairs and sat us down at table and said then have the Buffet. Ok. that seemed ok, but what no one told us was the price of this Buffet. I went around the corner to the Buffet table was quite surprised. It was a long table with several pans with little candles under them. One of them had some eggs, another had bacon, and one had potatoes. You could toast some bread but the toaster did not brown it. So you had warmed up bread not even brown. You could have cereal, or a waffle. Then the bill came and it was $70.00 for two breakfast. I was so surprized. The free breakfast that you get at the Hampton Inn had more to chose from then this Buffet. So I learned my lesson, the next time I stay at this hotel, I will defiately not eat at their restaurant. This is the only bad think I can say about this hotel. The service was great, so was the location of the hotel, the rooms are clean and smell nice. I would stay here again, as it is so convient to the Subways, and entertainment just outside of your door. Great Hotel.

I was looking for a hotel in the Times Square area so I could have easy access to Penn Station to take Amtrak back to Philadelphia and into work on that Monday morning. It a nice April afternoon when I arrived at the hotel from overnighting in Lower Manhattan. The hotel lobby was a hive of activity: guests checking in and guests waiting for rooms and curious folks popping in to check out the new hotel in Manhattan. First of all, the hotel is located a 4-block walk from the Times Square–42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal Subway Station. The location really couldn’t be beat. I could go anywhere I wanted in NYC that the subway went from my location. With the subway, taxi or über for Sunday Funday with easy. The front desk clerk was busy checking me into my room, part of four clerks facilitating the line of guests. We had a brief chat about the opening of the hotel – the end of March – and they were in the middle of their soft opening – since the hotel restaurant wasn’t open. He was said by end of May the hotel would be officially opened. Because of the soft opening and to get all the kinks out, the rates were discounted at $114.99 a night. This is why I snatched the room up. The décor was very contemporary and the lobby was donned in sleek gray, silver and white fixtures with pops of lilac and red. There was plenty of room in the lobby to make yourself at home on the spacious black sofas. You can feel a hint of Riu’s native modern Spain in the atmosphere. The deluxe king bed felt sizeable for New York City due to the vast amount of white furniture and fixtures. The bathroom was tucked by the door and fitted with a translucent glass wall to let light pass but provide privacy in the shower. All these touches made the room feel spacious. The room was accented with cream and lilac and a piece of artwork emphasizing a NYC landmark. My view was straight down 47th Street and I could see the Broadway lights. At the end of the trip, it was safe to say that It was a very modern, comfortable room and hotel.","Richfield, Minnesota","IrishWombat73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richfield, Minnesota</strong>",21,5.0

But it is more economical than the $24 breakfast.Weighing our visit up, we will definitely return to the hotel and would recommend it to family and friends.

I write this review for people going with their car.The hotel doesn't have parking and you have to use valet parking. I stayed there from July 01 till July 4 for a total of 3 days. I gave my car for a valet parking. I paid during the check out for the parking fees. When I asked for my car, they took my voucher and I was told that waiting time is approximately 40 minutes. We waited in the lobby, and when the waiting time was abnormally long I asked again for my car. There were confusion and after some phone calls they told me they didn't find my voucher and I should go by myself to the parking IPARK on 48st w and that what I did. At the parking, They asked me to pay again but for 4 days because they parked the car at 2:04h PM and received the claim at 2:33h PM, so they charge one extra day. I was obliged to pay a total for 4 days at the parking lot again to get my car. I went back to the hotel, the manager was unable to explain to me why I paid twice for parking at the hotel and the parking lot? And she was unable to cancel the extra day parking charge despite the long waiting time at the hotel lobby. She canceled only the parking fees charged in double during the check out at the hotel. I believe when the hotel choose a parking, it should assure a minimal quality of service. I write my experience to help other people avoid the same situation.

However, they do take a security deposit of $200 on a credit card. Last time I came to New York, I stayed at the Wellington and they took a $70 security deposit from my normal debit card. So I was a bit surprised when the man said $200! But there was no problem and about 2 days after my departure the funds were released back onto the credit card.The room was clean and tidy, there was no dirty bedding. The room was cleaned every day, and we were left fresh towels. The shower does leak a little bit but if you shut the door properly, the only water leakage is when you step out of the shower. Other than that, the shower is actually quite amazing!I can see what people mean about the walls looking old, as there are a lot of black marks, but I guess that's what comes with having white walls!The wifi was really fast, just like having wifi at home. I face-timed home most days and had no connection issues whatsoever.We never ate at the hotel, so can't really comment on food. However, breakfast is advertised at $24 per person I think, plus taxes and plus a tip for the server! Instead we paid $9.95 for a breakfast buffet at Sbarro which was next door to M&M's world. Half way through the holiday, the hot water did go - the only thing we can say was a negative. When I called front desk, the woman did seem eager to get off the phone. She said she was aware of the issue and that they are working on it. So it was a cold shower that morning. When we got back to the room in the evening, it was ok heat wise, but wasn't ideal. The next morning it was back piping hot but the sink tap didn't run hot for the rest of the holiday. But it was not a major problem really.Check out was fairly easily too, they have an easy check out option but I was never told about this at the start so I didn't know how it worked. So I joined the queue in the lobby and was checked out within about 15 minutes.The hotel kept our luggage until 5pm when we were picked up from our transfer.Over all it was a really nice stay and I would be more than happy to stay here again!

The staff couldn't have been nicer (despite reviews to the contrary). I got there early expecting to just check my bag but my room was ready and I was checked in minutes later. (To be fair though, at 3:30 when I returned a bus had just dropped off a lot of people so there was a long check in line) But I can only speak for my experience. Every staff member was very nice. I couldn't figure out how to turn on the AC. The young man at the front desk talked me through it in 30 seconds and we had a good laugh over my missing the obvious. The bartender was sooo nice, she made me my special mocktail and it was delicious. At night when I returned seemed like a lot of staff covering the elevators and each and everyone said good night to me. I felt very safe. My room was super clean. Not huge but I had room to maneuver. (I spent little time in the room other than to sleep). I was on the 11th floor facing 8th avenue and did not hear a sound. The bathroom was clean and nice.

We got the NYCAirporter to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and just walked from there, it's about 10-12 mins walk away. The hotel is really big so you can spot it rising above the other building as you approach. It's a newly built hotel, very Morden and spacious. They have a bar/restaurant which looked really nice but we didn't go in and a coffee shop which was quite reasonable for coffee and snacks. Staff were really friendly our whole stay, always someone there to great us. The bellboy will look after your luggage once you've checked out if you have a later flight or whatever. The room was modern, clean and tidy with a gr at big window looking out onto the Main Street which was great to see the bright lights and the goings on if the city. Don't worry, they have blackout curtains too though! They provide plenty of towels, nice bigs ones as well as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion, which were all lovely. My only thought would be that the bathroom is basically a big frosted glass box within your room, you can see the silhouette of whoever is in the shower and the glass sliding door didn't completely seal shut so depends how comfortable you are with your room mate! so if you like a bit more privacy when you are using tha facilities it's might not be the best for you - there's a big to so you can always pop the TV on though! This didn't bother me but thought back to being in that 'new relationship stage' I might not have been so happy about it then. Overall though I thought the hotel was great and I'd more than happily stay there again. There was loads of food and drink places near by, including some quieter side street too.

Beds very comfortable and we slept well. For a hotel so central it was very quiet, we were on the 8th floor and had no problems with the lifts. They came quickly and provided an efficient service. The staff were polite and helpful and we had no problems checking in or out, very efficient once again. The doorman was particularly helpful in recommending good breakfast diners and with directions. Bar was open until midnight and staff were friendly. Foyer and bar were very modern and spotless. Location was great, near to everything but a very busy area if you like the quiet life it may not suit. Great restaurants nearby with an enormous choice of price and food. We ate very well! Only things hotel could improve on were, tea and coffee in room would have been nice but there was a coffee shop in the foyer, also a different design of bathroom door. Ours was sliding with a gap so privacy was lacking, a proper closing door is needed on a bathroom. We did not have a problem with the frosted glass walls, you could only see shadows from bedroom.

Water leaking from the shower wasn't a problem as we used the smaller shower head and not the big rain shower head. The window had blackout curtains, net curtains and plain curtains so the room was dark during the night. The only very small negative is the only available electric socket near to a mirror is in the toilet. Not handy for hair straightners when you're partner is waiting to use the toilet. There's a full length mirror in the bedroom but the socket is about ten feet away.

We had read the reviews before we went but had already booked the hotel a few months ago so just accepted that with it being a new hotel it might have a few teething problems. I will answer some of the negatives people had posted.The hotel has a strict 3pm checking in time and generally go to that we had arrived about 2pm and just had a coffee and cake while the hour passed. It is true we had travelled from the UK so it was a 6-7 hour flight and then the train from Newark Liberty International airport to 32nd street and then a short (about US$12.00) ride to the hotel but that fine as the hotel posts check in is 3pm. We took our room on the 27th floor over about 2.45-2.50.We did have difficulty with the air conditioning but that was down to us not been able to operate it. Once we found out how to operate it, it was good. Maybe the hotel could place instructions in the rooms on how to operate the air con. The shower was excellant and although some posters have said the showers leaked we only had a problem if we did not close the cubicle door correctly.All the staff we came in contact with were really helpful and a special mention to the lady in the cafe who went out of her way to make you feel at home. She will know who she is but just to make sure she did have a problem with her right arm which when we came home was heavily bandaged.Rooms were well cleaned and the meals in the restaurant were in my opinion quite reasonably priced for the area.Some posters have mentioned noise and maybe because we were on the 27th floor we did not have any problems but I suppose the hotel could fit darker coloured curtains as it is quite light in the rooms.Rooms are small some people said but I would say average size for a large city and even some said no place to put your suitcases. We had two large suitcases and one went in the closet on the top shelf on its side and the second was stood up beside the ironing board in the closet so no problems.The young man on the door got us a taxi to take us back to Penn Station and while we waited we chatted about the upcoming presidential election and the upcoming UK referendum and it was good to hear a outsides view on the stay or leave campaign in the UK.The location for the theater district is great as the hotel is on West 46th street and 8th avenue with Times Square less that 5 minutes walk away.I would definitely use this hotel again on my next visit to New York.

I gushed about this hotel to my colleagues in the travel industry and it takes a lot for me to gush, as I see many hotels and resorts all over the world.BRAND NEW, lobby is sexy, modern and chic all rolled into one. LOVED the decor (check out my pics) with swanky seating in the lobby, COOL lounge/restaurant, street side coffee shop for people watching,what else do you want? OH yes, the rooms, little smaller than possibly the Marriott Marquis, BUT well equipped. Great comfy King sized bed, nice TV, great rain shower with separate hand held, one sink but nice storage. Has hair dryer and ironing board with iron. Desk had outlets but no USB as is common in new hotels. FREE WIFI worked GREAT. There is a daily resort fee of around $13.00 per room per night.Bathroom is not huge, has a frosted glass wall that separates the bedroom and bathroom, can't see anything, just shadows. We had the top floor with a partial Hudson River view and sky scraper view, outstanding to see at night. Located...less than 3 minute walk to restaurant row and Times Square, GREAT LOCATION and 3 minute walk to Subway.We also had dinner one night (have to review the food as well) and I have to say, best hotel/restaurant dinner I have had in a long time. FRESH Grilled Fish is what I had and my hubby had 12 ounce steak, so tender and juicy. We ate in the brightly lite courtyard which was quiet if you did not want to hear the bar/lounge clients.

Glad to say the worries soon disappeared. The room is bright and well decorated with a comfy bed, good toilet and shower and the sound proofing against street noise is far better than the last hotel we were in on 8th Avenue.Some previous complaints were about the white walls in the rooms having marks on them already. There is a skirting board around the room and to me the marks on the walls are being caused by people careless with their luggage.The shower leaked slightly but that's caused by the water running down the inside of the door and out onto the floor. I mentioned this at reception and was immediately offered another room. An extra towel along the bottom of the door solved the problem and towels were changed every day. Anyway, it's hardly fair to blame the management and staff for a design fault. The sink has a large shelf underneath so no problem placing toilet bags. Complimentaries were renewed every day.The only sounds we heard in the corridor at night were made by people who came in late ( no problem with that) but then they didn't care who heard them shouting or banging their door.The staff were very friendly and smartly dressed and seemed to us to be efficient, especially Hansel who went the extra mile when we were having trouble arranging our airport transfer.He stayed on the 'phone to the shuttle company for a very long time and when he solved the problem he even brought the information up to our room.We never even looked at the restaurant menu after paying $21 plus tax for a small glass of wine and a beer which was not much more than half a pint. That was the only time we were in the bar.For anyone who wants a light breakfast visit A Slice of New York Pizza Cafe which can be found 2 minutes outside the hotel. Turn right into 8th Avenue and it's 2 doors along. The pastries in the morning and pizzas at night are very good. Last but not least wi fi is excellent.All in all we would definitely go back to this hotel.","Grangemouth, United Kingdom","ianbb20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grangemouth, United Kingdom</strong>",31,5.0

First of all check in with barely any line took far too long... We were 25minutes in total at the desk checking in & then we discovered that because we had two reservations (first one for 1st to 3rd & second one for 3rd to 5th, we decided to extend our stay 2months BEFORE we went on holidays) we had to come back to the desk on the 3rd, check out & then check back in which took another 25minutes, surely with modern technology they could of just checked us in the first day for all 4 nights!! But that aside, the room itself was lovely, very modern, loads of space, fab rain shower, very comfy bed, fully working air con, full cable tv. The hotel is literally 1ave over from Times Square. The fashion bar is ridiculously expensive, $15 dollars for a glass of prosecco, needless to say we didn't spend too much time there. Right around the corner on 9th avenue you have an array of pubs & restaurants for you to choose from so I'd suggest going there if you don't want to pay a fortune for a few drinks.

I was aware of the pre-opening clitches and some bad reviews before arriving but I still wanted to see it myself. Okay, first of all if you want to stay at the Times Square, it really can't be much more central for this price. And yes the prices overall in NYC are insane considering that the price you pay, in many other cities with the same amount of money you would be pampered like a king. RIU Plaza makes a good effor though, however the decor is a bit too mix of Asian colors and European minimalistic style making it look a bit cheap for my opinion. You can see that the hotel has been built in a cheap way. Especially the corridors leading to rooms are really pale and naked without any carpets. So ALL the noices will come to the rooms. Elevators on the other hand are super fast, which is nice! Wifi also is a bit unstable and it's annoying to put the password all the time.We had a double queen room for 3 people so it was okay with two big queen beds. We all could open our luggages and you can still move at the room so that was okay:) Bathroom is modern and minimalistic style. Overall the room is fine and the beds are comfortable. There is a small gym downstairs which could need some heavier weights and more machines. Now I would call it more like a gym room.Our stay was fine and I could return if the price do not get much higher after the pre-opening.

On the whole we were happy with our stay here. The Rui Plaza looks great on arrival with a bright spacious hallway.We arrived around 1.00pm and checked in straight away - no queues! We were also able to go to our room early as it was ready. The room was bright and tasefully decorated. Comfortable bed, good storage space and a decent sized bathroom with a shower.After showering the first morning, water had seeped out onto the bathroom floor and into the hall of the bedroom area. We reported this to reception and was told that this was a teething problem in many of the room. A repair was carried out and the following day there was water on the bathroom floor only. After another visit to reception another repair was carried out. After that there was still a little waster seeping out.The breakfast bar was open and on the first two days a continental breakfast was available. On subsequent days a selection of hot food was introduced and the price of the buffet went up to $24, plus service. The quality of the food was mostly good, but I feel the price was expensive - but then I found most prices in New York expensive!The staff in reception and the breakfast bar were fine. The situation of the hotel is very good - just 5 minutes to Times Square.You also have to pay for wifi which worked fine.I would be happy to stay here again, but would look for somewhere close by for breakfast.","East Kilbride, United Kingdom","Barrie96</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Kilbride, United Kingdom</strong>",85,4.0

Now a soft opening means that the rates are lower but that the hotel is testing themselves in running the hotel. So all in all we did expect some hiccups here and there, but on the other hand we had an affordable deal. We were given a room with a balcony! What a view! Only very few rooms have a balcony so I suggest you inquire about this. The room was small, - nowhere to put your suitcase, but it was also modern and nice. There were a few design flaws which I wouldn't have expected from a new hotel, and I hope there is an embarrassed designer somewhere behind it. The cupboard with the mini fridge was too big, so it reached over the window and the curtain couldn't open at that end. The shower was leaking out on the bathroom floor. The bathroom door could not close 100%, so it was open for all sounds etc. The concierge's room for storing suitcases was much too small and they did not have a system how to store the suitcases (one big mess).I hope quality control or snagging will fix all these flaws in the near future. When you enter the hotel there is a bar/restaurant on the left. This is a very smart place, white and beautiful design with posh toilets. I really liked this place - with friendly staff.The hotel is situated within 5 minutes walk to Times Square, Very convenient to move around, also by metro/subway. However can I suggest that you learn all about the subway before you enter the train station as there is no help anywhere, nor in the trains. Bring a subway map.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Pix5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",136,5.0

On Restaurant Row, between Hell's Kitchen and Times Square. Walking distance to Port Authority. Beautiful new hotel with attractive lobby and public spaces. Our room was on the top (30th) floor, corner room with a great view. Room was small, but nice, clean and modern. Beautiful glass enclosed bath with a shower. The first issue we encountered was after what we thought was a seamless check-in with the front desk. When we reached the elevators we were told they weren't functioning and we would need to use the service elevator. Not a big deal, it was just around the corner and we just had a couple of bags we kept with us. However, when we got around that corner there was a long line of guests waiting to use it. We waited several trips before making it on. Once on the elevator we noticed it only went as high as the 28th floor. We exited there and looked for stairs. A housekeeper directed us to a staircase. After climbing the 2 flights, with our bags, we found ourselves on the roof! Not a rooftop meant for guests, but the roof. We turned around and went back down. We found another housekeeper who brought us to a different set of stairs. These stairs did bring us to our floor, but not a good first impression! The elevator issue continued throughout our 3 night stay. They weren't always down, but frequently. We also learned there was a specific set of elevators to reach the 30th floor. Something the front desk failed to advise at check-in. One time we were waiting for this elevator for several minutes behind other guests. There were bellman and other staff milling about. No one mentioned that the elevators weren't functioning! I had to go and ask the front desk, who insisted that they were functioning. Nope. On our 2nd night the fire alarm went off at 1:30AM. It was a loud alarm and rang repeatedly. After several minutes there was an awkward announcement not to leave your rooms. That the issue was being investigated, but there was no danger. The alarm and subsequent awkward announcements continued for the next hour. There was never any acknowledgement of this inconvenience. No complimentary anything. Another issue had to do with housekeeping. Every time we would return to our room after housekeeping had serviced it, the room would be unlocked. Every time. The door needed a tug to lock properly, and they clearly were not aware. The last thing I'll mention, and this is just odd, we witnessed housekeeping staff cleaning a large area of floor by the elevators using their feet and scrub sponges. Pushing the sponges around with their feet. They don't have a mop?? There was a general feeling of inexperience and lack of training. The staff seemed unable to deal with the many issues they were facing. I would recommend staying away for a while.",Rhode Island,"RAP64</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rhode Island</strong>",14,2.0

GREAT SERVICE - ruin someones holiday and then just ignore them after....I am now writing this review so other people do not encounter the issues we did. First and foremost this hotel service is shocking and they don't deserve to be open.Summary: Stayed at this hotel for 11 nights. Worst hotel stay ever - encountered problems on a daily basis. I have a letter of support from Joana Tormo Calatayud (General Manager) attached to this review.The general manager does not mind me posting this negative review as she detailed that ""She doesn't care what is written on TripAdvisor"".Summary of issues:Monday 9th (First night) - took 2 hours to check in to room 2213. Shown various rooms and reception staff were not very helpful. Require re-training.Tuesday - Door to room left open. Noticed at 4pm; therefore must have been left open all day. Nothing was taken luckily.Wednesday - Door left open again. Informed reception. Air-conditioning not working in evening, informed reception who said they will sort issue. Issue not resolved for 2 days and got fed up of chasing.Thursday - Still no update on the air conditioning and asked for rubbish to be cleared in room. Nothing done.Friday - 6am loud bangs on door. Was maintenance person to look at air con. Told him to go away. Ruined sleep.10pm noticed water leak in the ceiling on entrance and the bathroom in two parts. Above A/C unit on electrical part - very dangerous!!! Wife slipped on entrance and hurt leg. (incident raised by hotel manager). Rang reception who sent person to take a look - said would send manager. 30 minutes of waiting and no reply. Had to go down to reception and moan.Put in room 2001 and had to re-pack and got in new room at 11.45pm. Was told to speak to Diego in the morning.Sat - Spoke to Diego and said will type up incident report to definitely get compensation. 6pm when came back no feedback. Constant chasing and other staff knew nothing of problems. One even stated we had been moved back to 2213 (old room) - but this was not true! Room pass also stopped working. Told to speak to Joanna in the morning!Sun - Came down early and asked to speak to Joanna. She could not be found and another staff member pretended to be the manager - after I moaned the real Joanna turned up.New issue with 2001 - shower water leaking into whole bathroom and into the landing. Causing a leak in the room below and very slippery and dangerous. Told can move room but we said don't want to as haven't come on holiday to keep moving and re-packing. Have lived with issues since that day. Asked for 6 big towels to put on the floor!!! Not a way to spend your holiday.Monday - still water leak from bathroom shower. Continually had to chase Joanna as she was never available and no updates provided.Wednesday - No Joanna again in the morning. Said would be back at 1pm. Came at 1.15pm. After speaking to her said I would need to go direct to RIU and she would support our claim with a formal letter (attached). Thursday - late checkout requested since first day and only sorted after a week. Told housekeeping want room cleaned due to water. Said will be cleaned. When returned at 1pm room not cleaned - complained and said that will be resolved. After waiting 30 minutes and moaning again they then came. This got us late by 30 minutes. We also arranged a taxi via hotel to go to JFK for $70 - when got downstairs was late by 10 minutes due to housekeeping. Porter said that taxi man has gone (staff had given it to someone else) and we need to go with another person he has arranged. When we got to JFK taxi man requested $89. Again the hotel let us down!As per the above the issues are not normal - this ruined our stay! Which is why I have posted this review to help others.Paid $4228.90 for the above hotel and look at the service and issues I had!","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Traveller26_84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",31,1.0

Positive things first: The location is excellent. You are a few feet away from time square and the subway station. For my first touristy visit in New York, I couldn't wish for a better location.However the hotel itself was quite disappointing.It seems to me that since the opening of the hotel, the rooms were never entirely cleaned because there was so much dust from the renovation everywhere in the room. In front of the window was a pile of crumbles and dust which was quite disgusting an there were already stains on the walls of the room.The sheets of our beds had disgusting stains, even when they were changed by the housekeepers. There were still big visible stains on ""clean"" sheets.We didn't get toilet paper for 3 days in a row. Even the last roll we had in the bathroom was gone, for whatever reason. We often didn't get any handtowels, so I had to call the front desk for both items, that sould have been provided.The bathroom was a pure nightmare. You don't have any privacy because the sliding glass door doesn't close properly and you can literally see the person sitting on the toilet, through a big gap between the door and the wall. How romantic... If this isn't horrible enough you can also watch when your roommate takes a shower because the shower is behind a foggy window, where you can clearly see the contours of the person taking the shower. You could also clearly see that the bathroom wasn't properly cleaned. So thank you very much Riu plaza for those traumatic and embarassing moments I had to endure due to this terrible bathroom while sharing a room with my brother. The bar was also a fail, because they didn't have many on the drinks they had on their menu. At the end, the staff had to go n buy me a bottle of sparkling water at the hotels own little shop, because they had none. Well, I've could have bought this bottle on my own for a cheaper prize than what I had to pay at this bar. They even bought the wrong drinks (white wine instead of red wine) because they didn't know their own menu. Another highlight were the 50$ I had block on my credit card, for every night we stayes at the hotel. So I had to save 250$ on my card until the end of my stay, which is quite a rediciulous amount of money, when the hotel offers such a bad service.Thank you also to the lovely lady on the front desk who didn't take me serious when I told her about the dirty room. She told me off by saying that the renovation on the floor we stayed was already finished a few weeks ago and that the rooms are clean. No apologies, nothing.What great customer service...",,ponponpug,8,1.0

It was the perfect spot to stay if you are spending most of your time going to the theater.The rooms are very small, the beds very comfortable, and it was very quiet. It did not have much space to put clothes. The bathroom sink lacked counterspace and there was no room to put anything. The biggest issue was the shower. It leaked, and I'm not talking a little. The drain is not big enough to handle the water flow and the edging to keep the water in the shower didn't keep the water in. The water leaked all over the bathroom floor, under the door, into the room, and out into the hall. When I spoke to the maid, she said ""I know. Most of them do that. I'll bring you more towels."" So my fix was to use extra towels and build a ""dam"" every morning before anyone took a shower. The other issue was no ice machines in the hotel. We had to go downstairs and ask for ice at the bar, and they would give us a few glasses of ice. But, the hotel is brand new, so it sure beats staying at some of the older places.

We appreciated that they accepted our luggage a full 5 hours prior to our check in time, to allow us an early start to our trip. The Room was very clean, and well laid out. Internet connection was really good. If i was going to dig for anything negative it would be that my feet did not touch the ground on the enormous toilet in the room, also not the most comfortable. Avery unique part of this room is the etched glass shower wall that is attached to the sleeping area. (Note if staying with a friend, this might be a tad awkward) Because the restaurant was closed we relied on the Cafe in the lobby, they offered some great baked goods, juices and coffee but the line can move very slowly (Waited 20 minutes for a water and croissant) Recommendation to the hotel, would be to have the till located a the start of the display for those that are not ordering or waiting on coffee can make thru quickly. Location is outstanding, from our room you could see the screens from Time Square.

The hotel lobby is nice and location very good, but unfortunately the positive review stops there. Upon check-in the bedding in the room was not clean, stains and hair on the bedding. We requested it be changed and it was addressed. The hotel restaurant was to be open and wasn't the full weekend we were there. However, after seeing the prices in the snack café that was open, I'm glad we didn't dine at the property. Very over-priced for food, many other options within walking distance. We tried to seek assistance from the concierge for a restaurant recommendation in the area that would be kid friendly but no-one was available at the desk even though it was Friday at 2 pm. The doorman suggested subway or Fridays. The most upsetting experience at the hotel was when we asked the door man on Sunday to assist us with getting a cab to the airport, JFK. Fortunately we knew it is a flat fee of $52 to JFK. He told us he secured us a cab for $70 to get the airport. When I questioned why not the flat fee of $52, he suggested that the tax and tolls plus tip got us to $70. After securing another taxi, I learned that the doorman was ""collecting"" the balance of the fee because he was referring the ride to the taxi. Basically the taxi would give him $15 and then we would pay the cab $70, but we were not supposed to know about their ""side deal"". This is very disappointing and dishonest that you can't trust the hotel worker to be of honest service to the guest. He even went so far as to bring out bags back inside after I asked him not to so that he could prevent us from getting in another cab that wasn't part of his side deal. I would not recommend this property. Many better options in the area.

Because the hotel is so new (opened March 2016 I think) everything is very clean and in great condition. The room was small, but didn't bother us since we don't need much ""extra"" room. Again, room very clean. The bed was comfortable. But there is a lack of amenities. We asked for a toothbrush, a sewing kit and a fork, none of which they could help us with. For a 4 star hotel I thought they would at least have a sewing kit or fork (even a Super 8 will have those!) They charge $13/day for wifi and water, but they never replenished the bottled water. So what exactly am I paying extra for? Obviously it's not the amenities. I would still stay there again for the great deal we got ($196/night +$13/night extra charge).",,Nate J,2,4.0

It did the job. Provided us shelter for 7 nights and had a comfortable bed to sleep in. Lot of people say it's a perfect location. To me not. Why you need to be so close to Times Square and Broadway shows? This area is noisy and expensive. Yes this hotel is in restaurant row 46th street and all the dining places in 9th avenue is close as well. But you truly get better food with more reasonable pricing anywhere else. You really don't get the perfect NY vibe here either. And for that reason I won't return to this hotel. I prefer Upper West side or East Village. Our room was superior king which are corner rooms and bit bigger than normal deluxe rooms. Views were gorgeous but windows are so dirty it's ridiculous. I know this is a new hotel and they're still some construction going on but dirty windows equals indifferent behavior. There's not enough storage for your clothes for a long stay which truly is a shame. Room is pretty though and as said earlier we both really loved the bed and the pillows. Towels were good quality as well. Too bad they didn't make the rooms soundproof as they advertised earlier. You hear everything from corridors and outside as well. If a light sleeper you really need to use ear plugs. Staff was not rude but not really nice either. I always got help when needed but honestly they either are new to the customer service or they don't care. No greeting in the morning or evening when passing them in lobby. Few days I tried to get eye contact with them but nada. If you wanted a greeting you needed to say it first and be loud enough for them to notice. Not a biggie but it would be great if they would show they care about us even a little. They didn't welcome us in check in or didn't ask how we liked our stay in check out and didn't welcome us back someday. To me that's pretty weird. Hope they start training their staff soon. Little things count! If you have booked to stay here don't worry this is an ok hotel which has lot of potential to become A GREAT hotel with some tender loving care. :),"Helsinki, Finland","Katjawho</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",40,4.0

Upon arriving there, I asked if they had anything higher up than the 8th floor that thy had us in, The lovely gal behind the desk told us to hold a moment, then came back to tell us that she had something on the 24th floor and that it was a free upgrade she was giving us! Totally cool.Sure, the rooms are kind of small, but large compared to many other places I have stayed in New York City. And the styling and cleanliness were Excellent. The TV was huge and the room was beautiful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. It was very easy to get extra pillows as well. ALSO, it was perhaps the best hotel shower I have ever been in. HOT hot water, 2 shower heads and it was very spacious.The gym in the hotel is pretty awesome as well. Set away from everything else and even has bathrooms with showers right outside the doors. Had a water cooler inside with cups and Poland Spring water. The TVs were Huge in the gym as well. Perfect for when you are on the treadmill or elliptical. They had free weights that went up to 50s too. The housekeepers were all very happy and glad to assist you in any way you needed. They always had smiles on their faces and asked if you needed anything.The bartenders were totally cool and made some great drinks! We brought our own bottle of wine onto the patio\courtyard area, which was totally cool, and the bartenders brought us waters and glasses. and were always asking if we needed anything.I WILL stay here next time I am in NYC.

I usually stay at the W or the Waldorf when I go to NY but as I was browsing I saw there was a new Riu opening in Time Square. I have stayed at the Riu in the Caribbean and it was great. I assumed it would be the same! I was totally wrong. I called the hotel early May to see if they were open because they had not opened yet at time of booking. The phone rang and rang and then just hung up on me. After 5 attempts someone answered. Yes they were open. The day before our stay I called to ask a question and same experience. No one answered and it took me about 5 attempts trying differed extensions. Again the phone would just ring them hang up on me. So we arrive on May 14. The hotel was nice and clean but not like the photos on the website. The photos were either from a different hotel or photo shopped. The room was small and screamed IKEA. No problem if that was it I would not be wasting my time on a review. The temp was set at 69 and cold air was blowing. We set it to 73 but nothing changed. We tried over and over and set it to 80 but no change. They don't tell u that the rooms are set so that u can't manipulate the temperate!! There were no blankets on the beds. There was something over the mattress that was a bit thicker than a sheet. So dah!! we were cold. I called and asked for someone to show us how to adjust the temp because at this point we had not realized that it could not be changed. I also asked for 2 pillows and 3 blankets. There was a sleep sofa but no pillows or blankets!! After half an hour I called again and repeated my request, another half and hour goes by and nothing! I went to the lobby and asked and was told someone will be sent. More waiting and a woman brings 3 blankets and 1 pillow with no pillow case! Fine so I go down again and ask again for someone to come adjust the temperature and one more pillow. They again tell me to go back to the room, this time I insisted I wait until someone got me a pillow and sent someone to adjust the temperature. They gave me a pillow ( no pillow case but by this point I didn't care). A nice technician came up and informed us that we had 2 options. Turn off the AC or keep it as is, there was nothing between off and 69 degrees. So we asked him to turn it off. I understand that it's a new hotel and there are kinks to be ironed out. But the concept of '' HOLD ON WHILE I GIVE A CRAP'' displayed by consumer service was taken to whole new level. Only one woman named Karen seemed to really care about customers complained, ( I was not the only one who came down to verbally request things because the phone calls were ignored) everyone else had an I don't give a crap attitude). I could have stayed at the W for $100 less and had a much better experience but lesson learned.

From the first moment we walked in to the hotel it all went downhill. We arrived early and was told our room wasn't ready. We understood that because we were early and check-in was not until 3. We were told to call back after 3 to see if the room was ready. We were out and about and tried to contact the hotel and couldn't get anyone to answer to see if our room was ready. We came back to the hotel and it was not and found out that the reason our room wasn't ready was because it hadn't been finally completed from the construction. I couldn't believe that they had rented me a room without it being ready! I demanded a room that was equivalent or better than the one I had reserved which was a junior suite. They gave me a double bed room which was a downgrade (2 double beds pushed together) and told us that they would try to have our room ready by the evening or the next day. To say the lease I was furious especially since I was paying $400+ per night to stay at this hotel! We agreed that we would accept getting into the room later or the next day. After going to a Broadway show and getting back at 10:30 they told me that the room was still not ready and that it would be a little longer. We finally got into the room around 11:15 that night. I really don't think they cleaned the floor before they told us it was ready because I was walking around the room In socks and they got dirty in no time of being in the room.I was very, very disappointed In the junior suite. On the website it shows the room with a king bed and a sofa bed which was what we needed since I was on a trip to New York with my 2 daughters. The picture DID NOT show that it was an open floor plan and that there was a soaking tub in the middle of the room with a glass shower and toilet area which gave no privacy to anyone. It was a good thing we were all girls, but it still was not acceptable! Through the whole process of being upset about the room and the inconvenience of the hotel, not once did the manager (Diego?) come from behind his desk to apologize and try to make things better. He could have cared less that we were unhappy. I guess that was what made me so angry. Later we realized that we did not receive our robes or slippers that were included in our package. So we had to ask for them which should have already been in the room. There was also no complimentary bottled water in our room or ice service at the hotel. On the last night, my girls and I went to go grab dinner and see a comedy show. We left the hotel around 7 and when we came back the door to our room was wide open! When we called down to the front desk the women told us that she was going to send someone up to ""show us HOW to close the door"". How rude can someone be? Obviously we know how to shut a door. How dare you tell someone you are going to show them how to close the door! Security did come to the room to make sure nothing was missing and we showed them that even if you left the door half way opened it closed on its own. We started to think that engineering or housekeeping had been in our room while we were gone but didn't understand why they would be in our room at that time of the evening since our room had been serviced earlier in the day. The issues we had with the hotel are totally UNACCEPTABLE. They could have been avoided and been handled differently with customer service. We will never be staying here again and will not be recommending this place to anyone. Don't let the pictures on the website fool you either. The rooms are not what they seem to be. The rooms were small and the appearance on the website may show that this is a 5 star hotel but it's not! The gym was also not what it appeared to be on the website either. It looked huge on the website and it was actually small and had few pieces of exercise equipment and no ventilation They also did not have any sanitary wipes to wipe down the equipment after use which I thought was unacceptable. The only good thing I can say about his hotel is that the doormen and the security officers were the only ones who seemed like they cared about our stay. Even though that made us fee like someone cared, it didn't make up for management of this hotel. I still can't believe that the manager did not offer an upgrade to our service or to comp us for the inconvenience we had. To be honest, I feel like I could have stayed in a 2 star hotel, been a lot happier and saved myself a ton of money! It was so disappointing, because I had planned this special Mothers Day weekend with my daughters in New York and staying in this hotel made the weekend a disaster!","Haymarket, Virginia","DonnaKeeney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haymarket, Virginia</strong>",3,1.0

I suppose the first thing to mention would be that I work in finance for a large hotel group in Europe, with one of my hotels just having undergone a £20m refurbishment program, so I know somewhat what I am talking about. I also worked in operations for a long time before moving to finance.The positives first:The hotel is in a great location and brand new (couple of month old) which can bring its challenges but overall its a nice property. 2 Blocks from Times Square but away enough to enjoy some more local restaurants and bars with some great ones being on 46th Street. Room size is average and rooms are appointed nicely, the decor is very modern (and a bit bland in my personal opinion) but nice nonetheless. Beds where comfortable and linen and towels where good quality.The not so positive:Due to the nature of 600 odd rooms, check in can be a bit lengthy with some queues, but was still quick enough nonetheless. The building is new and I would expect some teething issues, which I can overlook quite easily.My biggest bug bear was that the Air Con did not work. We were on the 22nd floor and it was hot outside so it was even hotter inside. Ave temp. was 82F. Opening a window did not make much sense and since there was roadworks outside the hotel, at night time it just wasn't an option. Hence the nights where ridiculously uncomfortable. The bigger issue was that during my stay (4 nights) I must have complained about 10 times, to be told every time that it would be looked at! It was finally ""fixed"" on the day of departure! Once I was standing near the concierge desk waiting, with one staff member passing me about 10 times but looking right through me. There seemed to be no interest at all and staff quite frankly seemed overwhelmed. As it turned out the air con was not switched on (which was heard by numerous guest) and was the main talking point in the lifts. For me this is the biggest issue as when booking a hotel, I am paying for a comfortable nights sleep and it was just impossible to have that.I therefore complained on check out about the air con and I asked for compensation, as simply the hotel failed in its purpose in my eyes and @ $275 odd a night, i feel it is warranted. I did not expect anything comp but a $25 - $50 reduction per night would have been appropriate in my eyes. The receptionist told me I had to speak to a manager, which was fine. After a small wait the manager arrived only to tell me that he is not authorized to process refunds, as a Manager, and that all such requests need to go through their central office and that he would leave my details with somebody contacting me. This was 2 1/2 weeks ago and sure, no one contacted me. For me this is the most ridiculous procedure ever and quite simply a delaying tactic in the hope that people could not be bothered taking it further, which is probably the case most of the time.Whilst I still enjoyed my stay most of the time, I would never choose to stay in another RIU again, regardless how old the hotel or where in the world. Customer service & more importantly satisfaction is achieved by dealing with issues and problems there and then, and not with having to leave my details in order to not to be called or contacted anyways.","London, United Kingdom","DennisWerian</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",11,3.0

A smaller problem is lines on the reception, both when you check in and when you check out (hint: pay for the hotel when you check in, that way you can do express checkout later). They seem to have some problem in the system because during the checkout they first told me one amount I owned, then the system printed a receipt for a much bigger amount, then when I pointed it out it took them 5 minutes to correct it - that probably adds up to the queue size.A bigger problem however is the design of the shower stall. It leaks water when you take shower and also when you open the door. If you just take shower once a day you have a soggy bath mat; if you take it more than once before the room is cleaned up, you end up with puddle on the floor. See my pictures.Guys, it's 21st century!

The door to the bathroom is a slider, and all noise carries, and the back of the shower is frosted glass that is next to a bed. With the back lighting you see the person in the shower.

The hotel is fairly new so the accommodations were immaculate. The lobby was large and very nicely appointed. However the hallways and room were nice but very stark, think white everything and very little decor. My wife commented that the hallways felt like a hospital. The beds in our room, including the pull out couch were very comfortable. The bathroom was set up in a good way and the shower was awesome! We could have stayed in there all day!

This hotel is very conveniently situated near Times Square.We checked in early evening and went for dinner at a nearby restaurant. We returned early as we were tired and ready to retire. Our twin beds looked inviting (although the pillows appeared to be rationed to only one per person, a bit mean) so we got ready to hop in.Luckily I pulled back the bedding first. Well in all my years of staying at hotels I have never been so disgusted. The beds had been made to look as if the bed sheets had been changed. The pillow case had been replaced but the sheets had not There was a plastic tag in the bead, black woolen fibres and body hair. My husbands sheets were stained, had hair and biscuit crumbs. Made us feel sick.I got dressed and went down to reception to ask for another room. When i explained to the receptionist that my husband and I had nearly slept in the dirty beds he seemed disinterested and told me he would send someone from housekeeping to change the sheets. I asked if housekeeping would be long and he said 20 minutes.I returned to the room and we sat on the sofa and waited and waited till gone 11pm. I was just about to go back to reception when I heared a woman across the hall complaining, to what appeared to be a lady from housekeeping about her leaky shower. Anyway, i asked her when housekeeping would be sorting our clean bedding problem. She looked at me and said she had no idea about our problem. She said she was really busy and had a huge list of problems to sort that night.We just wanted to go to bed so I told here to bring us some sheets and we would re-make the beds ourselves, which we did, after the lady had taken pictures of the dirty sheets. So to anyone booked into the Riu Plaza I say ""check your beds"".I can't see how this hotel could possible achieve 4*. The rooms are very cheaply and hastily put together. 1 pillow each is 1* stuff.

Meh, that's where it ended. Check-in and check-out lines are ridiculously long, even with 5 people working the counters. Next, the rooms and structure have great potential, however... All white in a hotel doesn't make sense. The walls already looked like the hotel has been open for months, even though it is only open a few weeks. The room, at first sight, is very appealing. There are faux wood floors, modern bathroom design. But there are so many flaws. First is the bathroom box is basically in the bedroom, with lots of open crevices. This gives the person the bathroom very little privacy. Next, there are no clocks, making it hard to figure out what time of night it is... because trust me you WILL be up all night.

This was not our first time in the area, but we surely wouldn't be able to justify another night at this hotel's full price in the future. Also, they should consider a night light or something softer so that if you need to get up in the middle of the night, the room doesn't look like a photo cube to do so.

The lobby is gorgeous, the reception people are super sweet and helpful, and doing the best they can. During the peak hours the check in and check out process can take long tho. I had no problem with that. The corridors leading to the rooms are all white, with no other decoration and look a bit like a hospital or a... prison :)However the rooms are very nice. A nice size, very clean and new. The bed is super comfortable (a bit on the harder side, but for me that is perfect). The bathroom is cool too, and in my room (324) there wasn't much of a shower leakage problem as many others have pointed out. I would have some negatives to say about the quality of housekeeping, since I had some issues with that in my room, but I suppose that might be the problem of one person not doing his/her job properly and that got communicated to the management. Another thing - the housekeeping started banging on the doors already a little after 9 am (check out is noon), which I find a bit rude and have never seen before in any hotel. Especially considering there is no way to get checked into a room before 15 pm. So that makes you feel a bit unwelcomed. But I'm sure once they get all of their facilities in order and houskeeping trained this has the potential to be an excellent place.The essentials are great:Location - perfectBed - perfectShower - perfectTowels - softReceptionists - friendly and helpful.","Tallinn, Estonia","kaidakaida</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tallinn, Estonia</strong>",23,4.0

When we finally got in the room noticed a 2x2 meter room with space for nothing, very poor on accesories. Later we noticed that Air extractor in the room did not work so we had to deal with our natural smells for quite a while until decided to open the window.Worse came later when trying to sleep.

The hotel itself was excellent -- the rooms were very clean, bright, obviously brand new, and quiet. I stayed in a room on the 5th floor with two double beds and found it to be more spacious and quieter than other NYC hotel rooms. The shower was excellent and the mini fridge was an added bonus. The only problem we had was with the staff. Time and again there were serious issues that took a lot of time to settle (for instance we had problems with the check in, check out, horrible car park, false charges on the bill, confusion about lost and found, rooms were cleaned when we had do not disturb sign up, etc.) that made our experience less than satisfactory. For instance, the check out took 2.5 hours (!!!) because the incorrect charges took so long to settle. Overall, I give it a 3/5 because I care more about the quality of my sleep than the friendliness of the staff, but I do think that there needs to be some major training before the hotel can be given the 5 stars it really deserves.

I stayed at the RIU in Cabo San Lucas and couldn't have been happier with my stay. So, I wasn't sure what to expect from staying here, considering the RIU Plaza New York Times Square just opened a month ago and they're currently in what they call a ""soft opening."" Some of the previous reviewers had mentioned some new opening growing pains such as long wait times checking in / checking out, no air conditioning, disorganized valet / parking service, etc.However, I think that the ""kinks"" that other reviewers experienced might now be worked out or are in the process of being worked out... because I thought my stay was wonderful.1) Decor - very modern decor and I loved the fact there was NO CARPET anywhere! Even in the halls (see picture) and the rooms themselves. I'm asthmatic and this was AWESOME. Not to mention, it means that rolling your luggage around is easy peasy.2) Front desk check-in / check-out - there was a line for the front desk but they had at least six people working and the line moved VERY quickly.3) Staff - I thought the staff was very friendly, helpful and plentiful. I think with the initial soft opening, they might not have gotten all of their staff at the RIU Plaza, but there were tons of staffers in the lobby area who were approachable for questions.4) Luggage storage - my initial impression of the luggage storage process wasn't wonderful because their small little room was stuffed and luggage was overflowing into the concierge area, so luggage was randomly put everywhere making it difficult to locate your bag when you came to pick it up. But, the next day, when I picked up my bag, I noticed that they had moved the overflow into a larger room and had worked out an effective system where luggage was organized by the anticipated ""pick-up"" time and by storage tag.5) Comfort (air conditioning) - because of the previous reviews that stated the hotel did not yet have air conditioning, I called the hotel before I booked my stay and received confirmation that they had turned on the air all throughout the hotel just two days prior. I can confirm that the air conditioning was working when I got there and in my hotel room.6) Valet parking - Some people have asked where you can park. As with nearly all NYC hotels, RIU Plaza provides valet parking (and valet parking ONLY). This will cost you $46 / day. OUCH, but I think what most hotels charge. I did not use the valet parking service, so I can't attest to how long it took to get your car, but I can tell you that they had a dedicated valet parking service.7) On-site restaurants - the full-service restaurant is not yet open and when I asked the front desk said it wouldn't be open for at least another month. Consequently, there is no room service either. There IS an attached coffee shop with ""grab and go"" food. I'd mention too that the hotel is located in the heart of restaurant row... you can walk out the main entrance and have a plethora of dining choices right within a couple hundred yards.8) Location -- This location is freaking unbelievable! It is one block away from the heart of Times Square. It's also right in the theater district. I was in room 2315 which was the southeast corner of the hotel and I could see glimpses of Times Square but most of it was blocked by neighboring buildings. You have magnificent views of the Hudson river on the other side. If you're familiar with the area, the RIU plaza is directly catty-corner to the Theater District Shopping Court.All in all, I have to say I more than enjoyed my stay at the RIU Plaza. While there might be just a few more kinks to work out, I would say that they have earnestly been working hard to get the hotel up and running to the same level that I've experienced at other RIU hotels.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","pingelizabeth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",12,4.0

I was excited to stay there because it was a new hotel, we got a great price and I have stayed at RIUs numerous times internationally and always have a great experience... until this trip. Let me start by saying that hotel is in a great location in midtown, it was brand new and very clean and the rooms are a decent size for NYC. The problem that we encountered was with the staff at check in/check out and dealing with them after we got home. To make a long story short, my friend and I split the cost of the hotel, each paying our own half upon check in. Upon check out, we were asked for our cards again and the woman who was checking us out had a hard time understanding that we wanted to split the cost between the two of us. She even asked a manager who was not helpful and mumbled ""I don't understand the visa system"" and walked away. After a half hour, we both paid our portion of the room and left. It wasn't until three days after we got home that I noticed a second charged from the RIU posted on my account. I called the RIU, asking why I was charged again and was given the run around. I was told I wold be contacted by the end of the day and wasn't. The next day I called again, say run around and I asked numerous times to speak directly to the manager and was told I couldn't but I could email him and he would email me back by the end of the day. I emailed him and still have not heard back and it's been 4 days. My bank is disputing the extra charge but the lack of customer service is horrible. A hotel is only as good as the customer service and this hotel has none.

I've seen this chain in other cities but this is the first one I've seen in New York-- it is very new and I get the feeling the lack of name recognition and newness was what caused it to be low priced. By the time you read this it will probably cost twice as much (Paid about $125 pre-tax). Even at that price if you are the type that likes new, clean rooms you will like it.

I was extremely disappointed with the service I received from this property. I travel to NYC at least 6 times a year and have been to different hotel with different rating class but this time it was a beyond repair.The good stuff: The location is prime. The hotel is located a block away from Time Square (46th and 8th). The hotel is of course brand new so the rooms were clean and beautiful. The lobby is reminiscent of a simpler version of Cosmopolitan in Vegas. Clean and easy on the eyes. The property has a gym and grab and go snack store located in front of the hotel. I would still suggest getting your snack from Duane Reade (it's cheaper).Now the disappointing part. I know it's a new hotel but the check-in process was a bit slow. I was caught in the mix of hotel guests checking out but there was no warmth with their front desk personnel. The lobby was WARM! The outside temperature was in the high 60s but the hotel lobby feels like in the high 70s. It was uncomfortably warm! Now going to the room, for a big hotel chain, I was surprised that there was no complimentary bottled water (just a heads up for future guest). My room was located on the higher number and had a good view of 8th Avenue. Now, here's what got me, Day 1 was a bit cooler outside and I did not noticed that the A/C is not working it was set to 77 F. During the day, I leave the hotel to go around the city so I was never in my room until bed time. Day 2 was different, the temperature hit 82 F and I felt the heat in the room. I initially called the front desk to let them know that I think the A/C was not working. They told me, they are sending an engineer to check it out. When the engineer arrived, he too noticed that the thermostat is not working and instructed me to open my window (seriously?!?!) I can hear the sirens from the street vibrating in my room. The second time I called, they sent the same person to check the room. I told the front desk and the engineer that the hallway is much cooler than my room. He stated that at least my thermostat went down to 76 F! (Seriously?!?! From 77 down to 76 F?) He again advised to open my window. It's 11pm and they are expecting me to sleep with street noise going into my room? I finally asked to be transferred. The front desk called my room and informed me that they have a room for me on a different floor. (It gets better) She ask me to come down to the lobby to get my new keys (what kind of service is that?!?!) I was already in my pajamas, so I packed my luggage, dressed up, and exchanged my keys at the lobby at 1230 AM! I finally got my new room and I know my A/C is working because I can hear it and the room cooled down in less than a minute. At check-out, nobody at the front desk even acknowledge that fault, or even asked me HOW WAS MY STAY? I mean, is this how they run a hotel? I think the front desk needs a refresher on Hospitality. I was in a rush to catch my flight and I was not able to talk to the property manager.There was no service recovery or apologies from the property and I can say that even Howard Johnson have a better service recovery that this.Disappointed!","Chicago, Illinois","markeetots</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",78,1.0

The elevators are a little small but are fast as lightening. I stayed on the 7th floor and it took the elevator less than 30 seconds from the time I got on the elevator. The halls are a little bare but they're huge and have window views of the city which are really just unrivaled. The room is extremely updated just see the photos I posted. I really enjoyed that the electricity in the room is controlled by placing your key in the walls soon as you enter. The room was pretty spacious (deluxe King). I loved the bathroom and window views. It was a fantastic experience. The thing I didn't love was how much purple is in the room. The service is pretty good. The Check in agent wasn't very memorable but I definitely appreciated being called in the room after checking in just to make sure I was satisfied.

This is at best a 2* hotel. When you arrive it seems nice but all of that changes as soon as you get to your room. Rooms are very small. We had booked a Double room for 4 people and the beds are pushed together because of the lack of floor space. It is not advertised in the photos arranged this way making it look more spacious then in reality. The hotel only provides 1 pillow per double bed, NOT the traditional 4 pillows per bed like other hotels. So we only had 2 pillows for the 4 guests in the room. We called down for extra pillows(2) and were told,""I don't think we have any more extra pillows but I will check"". I have never been to a hotel that has no extra pillows! The Double room provides a pull out sofa that had no sheets, blankets, or pillows available for it in the room. After waiting for the lobby to call back about the pillows, we inquired again. Again we were told that there were no extra pillows available. We requested to speak to management and were told that they would be there in the morning. So 2 of the 4 people in the room had to sleep with no pillow. Also we found out in the middle of the night that there is NO air conditioning in the hotel. Management and staff are very aware that they have no air conditioning and that is not communicated to guests upfront when checking in. The manager, Micah Polansky, then proceeded to lie to us and state that ""no hotels in NYC currently have air conditioning."" This is clearly not true as our hotel we moved to had no idea what they were talking about and it was 1 block away. It is a sham that the staff does not tell customers when they check-in that there will be no air conditioning and let the guest decide if they can stay there or not. I would have never stayed in a hotel with no air conditioning available and it is unfair to guests to not make them aware of the situation and then refuse to refund their $$. It is very uncomfortable to sleep in 80 heat, especially with no pillow. Beds are not plush, they are a very basic quality mattress and quite stiff, not 4* quality. Showers leak an excessive amount of water and you will need extra towels to make sure it doesn't leak all the way into the room. They do not provide irons to iron your clothes in the room as advertised. They do not provide bottled water in the room as advertised and there are only 2 paper cups to use. This is NOT a 4* hotel! I would never recommend staying here unless you are paying a 2* price and they actually get air conditioning, pillows, and fix the leaky showers!!!! Very poor guest relations when they are very aware of all these issues beforehand. This was a complete bait and switch...promising a new 4* hotel and giving you an unfinished 2* hotel. They also would not let me leave the hotel until they charged my credit card for the full stay, so I was forced to charge the full amount in promise of a refund because that department doesn't work on Sunday. I won't be surprised if that never happens.","Dallas, Texas","galldall</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",1,1.0

For what was hardly a bargain price, you get -- a room. And for a new hotel, you do not get a clean room -- at least we didn't. My daughter dropped the remote and it slid across the bare flloor in a corner; when I picked up it was covered in fuzz/dust. There is no comforter on the beds and the sheets are scratchy. I asked for an upper floor. We were given -- the third (could you put us any lower!) I travel enough to know better! (Marriott where are you tonight?) Also, I looked at my bill and it says I'm going to be charged some $13 resort fee. Resort fee? For what, there is absolutely no amenities at this hotel in the room or out...not evne so much as coffee maker. But my favorite is the few things that RIU uses to justify this fee -- didn't exisit, for us and that was supposedly a free bottle of water. Yep, Can hardly wait to take this up with the front desk. Didn't bother to do after checking in took forever. I waited in a line 3x. First - my fault. I forgot my license in the car. You'd think when I came back, they'd advance to the front line. Nope. Then when I got there, I was told...ready for this...they couldn't make a reservation for me that I had to go around the corner to the hotel computers and make an online computer, because they couldn't do it for me. What? So I played the game and went around the corner and made the reservation. Came back. You guessed it. Had to wait in the line - again!!!! This was after driving since 4 am. We love our trips to NYC and have met super nice people here. This place is bland, unfriendly and for the first time, we can't wait to check out of our hotel.",New Hampshire,"missp0rtsm0uth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Hampshire</strong>",7,2.0

This hotel is brand new. Its european design is modern and clean. The rooms are small but comfortable and the location is great if you're visiting the Time Square area. With that said, management needs to work the kinks out. First, having to stand in line both to check in, and then again to check out is a giant waste of time. They require this as they charge your credit card for an additional $50 above your room rate union check-in for ""incidentals"". They then refund this fee at check-out. If I leave my credit card number at check-in, simply charge my room and any ""incidentals"" after I vacate the room WITHOUT making me stand in line again. Also, be aware that the air-conditioning in the rooms is not working. The windows in the room open so it wasn't intolerable during the night, but it was 78 degrees when the sun was out. The weather for the next few days calls for near 80 degree days, those rooms will be VERY warm. The clerk said that the air will not be on until May 1st. Lastly, the coffee shop is now open, which means that they no longer have complimentary coffee in the lobby and there are no coffee pots in the rooms. The wait in the coffee shop were long only to find out they had no cream.I understand that we paid a discounted rate for the ""soft opening"" and accept that there is work to be done. I would watch the reviews closely because when the rates go up, and the problems persist, I would not recommend this property. If they fix the problems it could be a very nice place in a excellent location.","Randolph, New Jersey","CraigW399</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Randolph, New Jersey</strong>",13,3.0

At our arrival they gave us a room arranged only for 2 people. We called the reception and we explained the inconvenient and after 30 minutes, the housekeeper brought us two more pillows and towels. We decided to ask an upgrade because the room was very small for 4 people, particularly the beds were 1,30 m for 2 people. The receptionist informed us about the price of this upgrade. At the same time we found the same kind of room at venere.com for a lower price than offered by the reception desk. We asked him if was possible to apply this price according to ""best price guarantee"" fare. He answered us: ""no problem, it's ok we can apply the lower price"". We moved to our new room and the sofa bed was not arranged. We informed the reception, so the housekeeper brought us pillows, sheets and blankets and she went away. We had to make the bed by ourselves. During our stay the room were clean in the late afternoon (5 o'clock PM) or early morning (8 o'clock AM). All day long other customers had problems with air conditioning so every hour arrived the engineer who knocked on every door asking if we called him. Restaurant and fitness area was closed. SURPRISE... At the check out they asked us 500$ more than discussed at the check in with receptionist. We also spoke to the front desk manager and he said the fault was with the receptionist when was said us that they were able to apply best price. In that moment we could cancel and re-booked on venere.com paying a little surcharge!!! This is something very serious because the receptionist represents a full-fledged RIU society. We filed a complaint against RIU and front desk. Finally, stay away from this disorganized hotel.","Bergamo, Italy","lowcostravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bergamo, Italy</strong>",85,1.0

We knew the hotel was new, so we expected there to be a few hiccups, but we thought that based on other reviews, our stay would be uneventful. I wish that was the case.After checking out, we had to wait 2.5 hours for the valet to return with our car. We were not the only ones who had this experience and bonded with many of our fellow travelers who were stranded by the RIU Hotel while waiting for their vehicles. When I complained to the manager Joanne, I was told it wasn't her problem and that ""this happens every Sunday."" When asked how the management was working to solve the problem so that other guests didn't experience a similar situation in the future, she didn't have a response. To add insult to injury, when I explained that I didn't think it was fair that I should pay for the convenience of valet parking, since it was such a failure, Joanne told me I could not get a refund.I completely understand that issues arise during an opening. If there had been communication about the problems (only one valet driver), I would have been much less angry about the situation. I suspect most people are reasonable, but the management's failure to communicate with guests who were complaining and their inability to try to mitigate the situation only made things worse.I felt very bad for the doormen, who were taking the brunt of complaints. The doormen could not have been more pleasant and apologetic. I suggest Joanne take some customer service tips from them. Overall, the RUI Plaza in NYC is a 2-star hotel that has a fancy appearance and 1-star customer service. Save your money and stay some where that values its guests and where you will actually get the services for which you pay.","Boston, Massachusetts","Adriana</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",6,1.0
