We’ve been to Tokyo many times and we were looking for something different, not in the centre of town. The room was comfy, good size, enough room to keep suitcases out. The bar was nice and reasonably priced. The Koenji neighbourhood is cool and we went to a hotel recommended katsu place for dinner, it was delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall very good. I recommend bringing eyepatches as the exit sign in the room was very bright.","Sydney, Australia","SydneySider1983</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",77,4.0

We discovered BnA Hotel Koenji when searching for boutique hotels and loved that the rooms were decorated by artists and that part of the proceeds of the room revenue is donated to artists. We arrived around 2:45 on a Monday and were greeted by someone who may have been a cleaning person who was friendly but wouldn’t let us go to our room because “check-in wasn’t until 3pm.” Didn’t matter that we were 15 minutes from 3pm and no one was in the room, we had to leave and come back. It was pouring with rain and given that there isn’t a typical lobby where we could sit and wait we left feeling a bit weird. When we arrived back later that afternoon we were greeted by a woman who I assume works at the hotel and were shown our room. The art was awesome and we were impressed by the spaciousness and design of the room, and loved the wolf murals. The bathroom is pretty modern and there are tons of usb outlets for all your devices. We were a bit worried about the bar/dj situation in terms of noise but as it was a Monday night it was luckily quiet. It’s a little weird checking out of a hotel with an empty bar but it was pretty seamless. If you have an issue there’s a bell you can ring outside that I think is connected to a cell phone and someone can assist within a few minutes. The Koenji neighborhood is pretty cool, filled with tons of vintage shops and bars. The Koenji JR station is literally a two minute walk from the hotel and you can access Shinjuku and Tokyo station directly from the line at Koenji station. So easy! Overall this is a cool hotel for someone who is looking for more of a local experience in Tokyo while still being able to access more central areas easily and quickly with the nearby JR station.

The hotel is located right outside the subway stop, which was so nice - and the hotel was surprisingly quiet! We had the room on the second floor - it was so cool to wake up to the brightly-colored mural every morning. The room was the perfect size for 2 people - it was small and there was no TV, but who cares about that?? We did not come to Koenji to sit in the room!The staff is very friendly and helpful and enthusiastic. Definitely hang out at the bar one night!!As far as Koenji goes, it is the best neighborhood in Tokyo! There are endless amounts of boutiques, vintage shops, restaurants and coffee shops - it was honestly hard to decide where to eat! Great yakatori spots and great craft beer bars! Japub was cool - they let people come in and DJ, which gave it a cool neighborhood vibe. My favorite boutique in Koenji was Kiki - definitely go check it out! Overall, I LOVED BnA and loved Koenji - just a fun, young, hip, friendly place :)","Brooklyn, New York","BedStuyTraveler9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",21,5.0

There are few places in the city (and country) like it. The rooms, live-in pieces of art, leave you inspired and the bar downstairs offers a chance to meet the artists themselves over a beer or two. If you're looking to exchange ideas, connect with fellow creatives and keep up with great events in the neighborhood, definitely check out BnA. Awesome staff who not only takes care of your stay, but adds to your experience in the neighborhood with recommendations, event invitations, introductions and more. Rooms are clean, well-furnished, and very spacious for Toyko with lots of light . Highly recommend the BnA Project - you'll leave as not only a guest, but a friend as well.",,Joe S,0,5.0

Entrance is through a bar - no Reception Area. Only 2 rooms. We stayed in the first floor room. Whacky to the extreme but comfortable. Good shower and reasonably comfortable single beds. Unfortunately on our first night they had a party in the bar and the music was vibrating into the room. On top of that there are air conditioning units outside of the window which hum all night long. So if you need complete quietness to sleep don't stay here. There are lots of trendy restaurants nearby. The hotel ""guide book"" gives excellent recommendations.

With just 2 rooms the BnA hotel is very laid back and hidden behind the ground floor coffeeshop and bar popular with hip foreigners. The recommendation guide in our room was great and the owner was friendly and welcoming.

If you're contemplating staying here, don't think twice. It's literally a one minute walk to the Koenji station, so no need to stay in one of the ""better known"" and more expensive touristy neighborhoods (since you have to take the subway everywhere you go to anyways in Tokyo, better to be in a cool local neighborhood). Koenji has everything you need for your base in Tokyo, including a supermarket and hundreds of little izakayas all within walking distance of BnA. Both Taz (owner) and Akira (manager) were awesome, and will give you excellent advice on cool things to do and places to eat that are not touristy (if that's your thing). The rooms are small, but clean, new, and well-appointed, and you really just need a comfortable bed to sleep in, since you're out and about all day.
