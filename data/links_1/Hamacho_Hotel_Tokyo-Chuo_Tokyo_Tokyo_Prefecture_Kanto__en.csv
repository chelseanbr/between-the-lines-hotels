We paid $800-plus for the two nights.We did not ask for any refund, which we were given, without asking, when we had stayed at the budget hotel Ibis Styles Kyoto Station for eight nights, reduced to two beause of our holiday shortened by the virus.Our corner room at Hamacho Hotel was large and well fitted out, although the king bed was rock-hard. We loved the ultra-new bidet, with the toilet seat automatically lifting when you entered the bathroom. Excellent walk-in shower adjacent to the bath.It was a Friday night and we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant. It's named Sessions -- should be renamed Short Sessions. The restaurant was dark and our table was 'lit' by one artiifical candle. Our obliging waiter shone his iphone light on the menu. We had arrived at 8.15 and the waiter informed us that the kitchen closed at 8.30. We hurriedly ordered the fish special -- snapper with scallops. It was smothered in a sauce that defies description. Totally inedible. The worst fish meal we have ever endured -- and we eat fish at least twice a week. We think the waiter took pity on us: the two sakis we each had were not added to the bill.The staff were friendly enough, but one of them said we could push our heavy luggage to the 'nearby' airport bus station. Luckily we ignored his advice.",Melbourne,"MelbourneHalls</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",33,3.0

The location is also not optimal - it's about a fifteen minute walk to the nearest metro station, which is itself rather far from many tourist attractions in Tokyo. That said, the Airport Bus stops only five minutes away from this hotel, which is a huge plus. That said, everything else in this hotel more than makes up for that. The wifi in the hotel works great, and while the room is small, it is extremely cosy and comfortable to live in. The breakfast and the restaurant at this hotel are also very good. Overall, given how affordable this hotel is compared to other hotels in Tokyo, I have absolutely no reservations in giving this hotel five stars, and heartily recommending it to any traveler, in spite of the two minor points above.","Boston, Massachusetts","Horace_Puffer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",47,5.0

From Narita you can take the Limo bus to TCat and walk 5 minutes to the hotel, even with big luggage it is easily manageable. As you get off the bus facing the building, turn left and walk down the street over the track for 300m, then you will get to the main street, cross it and walk another 200m and the hotel is right there.Hamacho station is the closest of three stations nearby, it has the Shinjuku line (green color) that u can take directly to Shinjuku station. You can also connect and go to Tokyo station from Hamacho station.The other two stations are further maybe 15 minutes walk and it goes directly to Asakusa and Shibuya. U can use the Line to connect with Ginza line.Now about the hotel, we booked two regular rooms, and they are small. It is the same size as a inside cabin for a cruise ship. The bathroom is also small, you can’t fit two people inside. However their toiletries provided were excellent and the shower pressure were one of the best we experienced. If you want a bigger room, when booking look for a different category. I think it called corner room.Staffs are super friendly. Laundry facility, $300 yen for a wash and $100 yen for dryer located in the 4th floor.If you are sensitive to noise ask for a room not facing the street. Both of room face the main road and we can hear train noise and siren once in a while since the police station is nearby. It didn’t bother us since we were so tire each day out sightseeing. The breakfast varieties doesn’t changed much. They offered Japanese and Western style, but after 3 days you don’t want to eat it anymore. There is a bakery next door, grocery store and lot of places to eat nearby.Internet is strong and good.",Newport Beach,"tibet71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach</strong>",68,4.0

From the main entrance where the bus stops don't enter the building. Just turn right (if facing the bus) and walk a few hundred metres. The hotel is on the left, opposite side of the road. No need to take a cab. The room is clean and comfortable with all the basic amenities you need. Staff is friendly and helpful.The three metro systems are within walking distance. A supermarket is just opposite the road where you can also choose from a variety of bento meals where discounts would be offered later in the evening. To the right of the hotel after the traffic light is a Chinese restaurant which serves authentic Chinese food.

I was very pleasantly surprised.First off if you fly into Haneda Airport (which you should try to do) you can take a limousine bus that goes directly to TCAT. This will run you 850 yen and take about 30 minutes. When you get to TCAT head left out the terminal door once you enter the terminal. Walk straight for about 5-7 minutes. At what I think is the third traffic light (I might be wrong here) turn left and in another minute the hotel will be on the left. If for some reason, you have too much luggage to manage the short walk, a taxi there will run 420 yen and take a few minutes of travel time. There is no such thing as an early check-in. You can check your bags and come back later if you arrive early. I was able to get to my room at 2:00 PM which is an hour earlier than the official time. In the meantime you can walk along the Sumida River (turn left as you leave the hotel and walk around three minutes or around Hamacho Park (turn right as you leave the hotel and walk around 4 minutes). The park is on your right.There are numerous small restaurants and cafes in easy walking distance. Right across the street is the large Peacock Supermarket open 24 hours a day. It has a large an interesting array of food if you need to save some cash. It also has a couple of microwaves available so you can heat up your purchases if desired.The hotel itself is no more than a year old. It does cater for the foreigner (at least half its guests). Staff have either good or at least serviceable English. The place including the rooms is spanking clean. My room itself was Tokyo compact without a great deal of storage. However the room is laid out cleverly so that it doesn't feel claustrophobic like some other equally rated Tokyo hotels. For one person it is quite comfortable. For two it might be a mite cramped, though if you are going to be out most of the day it shouldn't be a real problem. Otherwise larger, more expensive rooms are available.Since Sunday, many of the cafes and restaurants are shut I did have dinner with a friend at the hotel restaurant. The room is nicely set out and is quite comfortable for a leisurely dinner. Prices are moderate and the food is quite good. Otherwise there is a breakfast buffet for 1800 yen. Didn't try it since I depended on the supermarket for breakfast needs. (There is also a boulangerie just two minutes away - left as you leave the hotel). The hotel also hosts a craft chocolate shop and offers guests a free sample chocolate. All chocolate is made within the shop. The offerings are hot chocolate, coffee and decadent looking desserts.The area seems populated with young families many of whom have young children. So for those traveling with children, this hotel and area may appeal.","Sydney, Australia","cfreedma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",136,5.0

I would recommend this room to anyone, I don’t think this can be beaten for the price. We had a deal with breakfast included, well worth it.Location wise it’s in a quiet (for Tokyo) area. Plenty of shops and restaurants within a 10 minute walk. On arrival from Narita we got a taxi from Tokyo station for ¥1400 which was well worth it for the door to door service when loaded with cases.

For JR you have to walk 18 minutes. 2- Sparking clean, specially the room and the toilet. I must congratulate the cleaners working on the 13th floor.... Thank you so much!!3. No noise in the room... the walls are insulated. 4. Very fancy toiletries included. 5. The front desk team do their best to help you in any request. I particularly must mention Paku and Hayashi (thank you both for your help!!!)6. The beds and particularly the Japanese pillows are SUPER comfortable... (I ended up buying two pillows online to take with me to Australia).7. Elevators are fast and never had to wait for long.8. Very nice breakfast, although please read below.The negative:1. The breakfast in the restaurant include a great selection of food, however several things are missing:a) Please include oatmeal and FRESH fruit in the buffet (not fruits submerged in sugar or any type of liquids)b) There was one day when no orange juice was available. This was unacceptable in a breakfast buffet.c) Make sure croissants are also ALWAYS available. One day there were a short amount of croissants. d) You should include a special take away breakfast order for guests departing before 7 am.","Sydney, Australia","Jota_Jota_O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",88,5.0

Hotel is really new and opened just a few months ago. Their website is fantastic for tourists, especially the ""Access"" page which outlines all of the subway exits you should take that are closest to the hotel. If you're trying to get here via Taxi, the english website also has the address in Japanese so you can show that to your driver. So helpful! It's also conveniently located near the the Tokyo City Air Terminal which is a big bus station with affordable routes to all of the airports. We were able to walk to the air terminal upon departure with two 50-pound luggage suitcases and get on a bus that took us directly to Narita with no issues. Staff was always friendly and super helpful. Bathroom was spacious, no knocking things over while you get ready like those tiny APA hotel bathrooms. One day, I had the Do Not Disturb magnet pinned on my door and they left a shopping bag near my door with 2 towels, water bottles, and amenities since they were unable to clean my room. That was SUPER nice! Never experienced that before at a hotel. The only negative is lack of irons/ steamers for clothes. Unlike American hotels that have an iron in each room, you have to request for one at the front desk. They don't have many irons at Hamacho and I had to wait for one to be available (which never happened during my stay). So, be prepared to pack clothes that don't require ironing!","Fairfax, Virginia","teaist7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, Virginia</strong>",0,5.0

Great interiors, decor and plants everywhere. My family and I enjoyed the Japanese style and continental breakfast for 10 days. The room is zen minimalist but with complete amenities. The toilet and bath is big and modern compared to other Japanese hotels. 24/7 Grocery right in front. Great dining choices around the Ningyocho Station and Shin Ohashi Dori Ave. Sumida River is just a few blocks away. Nice walk to people watch and dog watch.

In the Hamacho you get the feeling you are in a very luxurious hotel for 1/5th of the price of the big 5 star hotels.- The rooms are tastefully decorated and the beds are very comfortable- Good location - not far from the city center at all (15 min walk to Ginza, 15 min tram to Shinjuku).Cons:- The bar and restaurant close quite late and there is no place to have a little night cap at the end of a long day.","London, United Kingdom","Julia T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",64,5.0

Unlike other reviews, we did not get an upgrade. After having read that, I feel I should have asked for one...Our room was one with a little garden patio, but the sliding door only opens a few inches so you cannot actually go outside. The hotel has the picture of our room as ""ツインルーム"". It works as a double room or as a twin room, but I feel it should only be booked for singles, as there is very little room.We both had average carry on roller bags and had trouble finding space to put them. There are no drawers or shelves that are big enough to put anything larger than a water bottle.There was a small fridge in the corner, which was nice, but I think this once, I would have preferred shelves.There were no stands for our suitcases, nor was there a desk or chair- there wouldn't have been any space for it. There was a wooden construction along the wall with the TV that had 5 hangers, and a small shelf (about 4 inches/ 10 cm deep) to put toiletries etc on. The room was very clean, well lit, with outlets by each side of the bed. The room has a small sitting area along the window, and a small table with it, but it's really not a desk.The hotel doesn't have a fitness center or pool.There are washers and driers on the 4th floor, and soap is provided. I don't remember what the cost was to do laundry.They clean every day and change towels and sheets very often (too often?)The restaurant serves a nice breakfast (see pictures), Japanese style and western style. You must purchase your coupon at the front desk before sitting down if it's not included in the room. Adults about $20, kids (12 and under) about $10.They close breakfast at 10 am sharp, and sometimes they were a bit slow or reluctant to refill some of the buffet items. I recommend getting there earlier rather than later. The food was fresh and tasty.The hotel is near Hamacho, Ningyocho, and Suitengu Subway stations, very well located and in a nice, local neighborhood.I was very happy to find such a nice place for about $80 per night.",,cbcos,25,5.0

The room layout was nice, facilities and amenity in the room are fully equipped.The location was great 10 minutes walk to Suitengumae station or Hamacho station.
