There is an amenity fee, which is described quite well at the start of this listing. All hotels in Waikiki (in Hawaii?) charge an amenity fee, so this is not a gotcha.We were in room 911 (easy to remember). It had a king bed, TV, A/C, table and 2 chairs, desk and chair, electronic safe, coffee maker, and a small fridge with a freezer compartment. There was a balcony with a table and 2 chairs.The bathroom had a big tub and shower.We arrived by car, early, and asked if they could hold our bags until check-in, so we could go sightseeing without worrying about luggage in the car. Sure, no problem. The man at the curb also suggested alternate parking, when I didn't want to valet park the car. He showed me the metered parking lot behind the hotel, but cautioned that it was not fenced in, and could be full.We used this lot, which cost (max) $25 for 24 hours, or $15 from 5 PM to 6 AM. Since we were gone during the day, we used the latter fee. Since street (metered) parking was free for 2 hours with a handicap permit (which we had), the effort to move the car at 6 AM was worth it.The breakfast would run out of things and could be very crowded, especially during rush hour, so plan ahead. We did enjoy the daily newspaper, and our friends (who are smokers, and arrived the day after us) really enjoyed the fish pond smoking area. I even tried the small hotel pool one day.There is a restaurant (can't remember the name) which is directly accessible from the lobby area.The staff was always friendly, and we enjoyed our stay.

There was so little to choose from- can not be called a continental breakfast at all! They offered only a few bread/ pastry items, cold cereal and pineapple or cantaloupe fruit. There was NO protein items- no hard boiled eggs- no yogurt- no oatmeal— it was pretty weak! Can’t believe they said this was one of the amenities we have to pay extra for!

The receptionist wasnt very helpful she just says checkin time at 3 and I cant promise anything early although a NOTE was stated on our accomodation booking due to an early arrival the hotel will try for an early checkin. We waited around the lobby area very exhausted. We went for a walk around the city and kept coming back and forth to the reception if by any luck we can get checked in like 11 or midday. The receptionist (I forgot her name) she did not acknowledge us at all during the numerous times we popped about around the reception area. She didnt have the decency to at least offer us a snack or water from the lobby as we were very tired after a long flight. Cases like these the front office or especially the receptionist shouldve prioritised our room. Hotel has to make guests happy and go out of their way to attend guests needs in every possible way. She could see we were exhausted and kept going out and coming back again and sitting around the lobby waiting. Never did she come to update us on our room and ask how we are etc. Im thinking of our elderly folks what if this was the case with them. Will she neglect them the same as she did to us. Finally we got checked in after 3 when we came back from lunch. Room was ok but an old musty smell lingered throughout our stay. Housekeeping staff were awesome and cleaning standards superb. The other downfall to our stay was the breakfast. No real hot food for breakfast. Like eggs and spaghetti or eggs and bacon. The dusted donuts they had couldve been replaced with cream donuts or savouries on other days. Also the breakfast was always full and not enough space to accommodate the guests. Guests had to sit round the pool area or near the reception area due to lack of tables and chairs. This is the first hotel I have stayed at that breakfast is only 2 hours. Very shocking!!! At least 6 to 10am or 7 to 10am. Guests want to sleep in but have to attend breakfast as their aware its only for 2 hours and want to make their moneys worth. The breakfast staff need re training again in all areas. There must be a staff waiting on the guests and clearing dirty plates. Most of the time dirty plates are not cleared for 10minutes or more on a table. Very poor service.

We picked this hotel due to it's location, price, and the fact that it has continental breakfast which is something that makes traveling easier and something you don't have to worry about. When we got there, the valet got our luggage from our shuttle and took it immediately upstairs while we were checking in. I'm going to breakdown parts of the hotel for those who are looking through reviews.Our hotel room was in the tower closest to the entrance, so we were not above the karaoke and steak house on the other tower. I sleep with ear plugs in because I'm not used to sleeping with my parents in the same room (and they wake up early.) I didn't think noise was an issue, but at times, you could hear the upstairs guest walking with heavy feet. The room was clean, and pretty big! Compared to other photos of other hotels, this one was big and one of the reasons we chose this hotel. However, I noticed that some of the amenities that were listed weren't included such as an iPhone dock/clock and a landline phone. We found the cord for it... but no phone? Kind of odd, but we ignored it for the entire trip (we pass by the lobby every day anyways). The A/C is directly above the bed, which is nice... but you can see all the dirt and dust that has accumulated underneath. I liked the shelf area right between the beds--it has two levels which means there is plenty space for all your electronics and your family's electronics. There is also another outlet on the wall, which was pretty good too. The balcony was nice--we were facing the Ritz Carlton. One con was that there weren't any drawers big enough to fit clothing. My dad and I were hoping to save space in the room (as if we needed to) by putting our clothes in the drawers, but there was none. The elevators were hit or miss. There is only one elevator per tower (there are two towers.) If it was breakfast time, getting downstairs from the third floor seemed to be a pain because the elevators would take so long to get to our floor, and sometimes the elevator was full, meaning we would have to wait again. There weren't any clear signs of where the stairs were, and it seemed like one of the doors leading to the stairs was locked. That seems like a safety issue as what if there's a fire? Luckily, there wasn't, but it would be something to look into. The bathroom. It's pretty big. Kind of dated. Again, another amenity that wasn't in our bathroom that was featured in the photos was a Japanese style bidet. The bathtub is huge! But I would be weary for any one who has problems getting in and out of tubs. You have to go over a pretty big, maybe 4 inches, side in order to get into the tub and take a shower. There is a handle bar across to help, but getting out of the tub can be difficult. Breakfast. I knew when booking this hotel that the continental breakfast was not the best, but at least it was offered. I also knew that people were complaining about the amenity fee of $25 a night that covers said breakfast, wifi, newspapers, ect. It's true. The breakfast is simply coffee, donuts, bagels, juices, fresh fruit and cereal. For us, we were really wanting some substantial protein, and so we went out to buy spam for a few days and other food. One day we brought IHOP (which is just around the corner, a McDonalds is like a block away from that.) We weren't the only ones who did this as I saw a couple people bring their own food on top of the continental breakfast food. So, with that said, please Aqua Oasis, include some protein like boiled eggs or yogurt. Paying $25/night for amenities should also mean that we get a better breakfast than what was offered. Also, breakfast is only from 7-9. It's super packed around 7 am (we went in October, the low season, so imagine what it would be like in the higher season) and then dies down around 7:45. We had one day where we went to Diamond Head, and as much as I said ""the breakfast could be better"", we couldn't have breakfast because we left so early. Service was pretty good. I didn't interact any more than usual with the staff, but they were all pretty nice and friendly. The only one thing that bothered me was concierge service. They are available, but only from 8-4pm. I thought it was pretty inconvenient as we were usually gone by 8 and wouldn't return until 3-4, tired from the day's activities. There were times where I wanted to ask the concierge desk where they would recommend for dinner, but most of the time they were gone. I know where I live, the concierge service was still around at 6pm. I would have used them more if they were available. Pool was okay, but you're like a 15 minute walk from the beach, so why would you not go to the beach? The patio area and lobby area is nice too. You can sit in the egg chairs and swing around. Location. The location is pretty good. It's a little far off from some of the things further down Waikiki past Duke Kahanamoku statue, but for what is around it kind of makes up for it. You're just a walk away from the International Market Place, Royal Hawaiian Center, Waikiki Plaza and the beach. If anyone is taking the Waikiki Trolley, the depot is a block away. There is a farmers market on Monday, Tues and Thursday that is just down the street. And Lewers is a one way street, meaning there won't be a much traffic... except for the trolley depot. The entrance to the trolley depot is at the front of the hotel, so when the trolley pulls in, they ring their bell, so you will hear that often during the day. Overall, the hotel is nice and clean. There some areas of improvement such as their breakfast, concierge service, and their photos. Some of their photos are outdated in what they offer (ie, iPhone docking station, Japanese toilet bidet) but otherwise, it is pretty accurate.","Everett, Washington","cheyser13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Everett, Washington</strong>",14,3.0

The inside of our PAID upgraded room here was old and dingy. The hotel staff also neglected to let us know during checkin that their water heater was broken and under repair for the tower we were in. Keep in mind there were rooms available that didn’t have this problem and we weren’t told. After a twelve hour flight, all we wanted was a shower and some sleep. Needless to say, the first did not happen. Neither did the second, as this hotels exterior walls are paper thin and the property is right by a night club or bar. We were on a upper floor and were woken every night by yelling drunk party goers at 2 in the morning. For the price paid, I would have expected at least a decent nights sleep, but that was also out of reach. Besides that the breakfast is truly the old style continental breakfast (donuts cereal and bread) and the pool is both silly and a joke. The parking staff was nice, but considering it’s 32 per night I would have been livid if they weren’t.

Nothing for the bread except butter and jelly (no meats/cheese etc), no yoghurt.

It was also VERY loud at night but this was mainly noise from adjacent establishments so not the hotel's fault. Regardless, take my advice to bring good ear plugs! The breakfast was sparse with only fruit, cereal, and toast/bagels but to be honest this was just fine because you probably don't need much more to tide you over when you have a busy day ahead of you. The pool was small, and a little uncomfortable when others were in there too, but still very refreshing after a long day in the sunshine.

It's a great hotel if you are wanting something really close to shopping and restaurants. The beach was about a 15 minute walk away. The hotel is beautifully decorated with several different plants and it has a really relaxing smoking area with koi fish and turtles. I don't smoke but my daughter enjoyed watching the turles and fish swim. If you are wanting a luxury hotel, this hotel is not for you! The rooms are decent but the restrooms really need to be updated. My family was out most of the day exploring the island so we only slept in the room. If you are really interested in exploring the whole island and getting out of Waikiki beach then I would recommend staying at a hotel in the center of the island. The island isn't huge but traffic made short drives long. The hotel offers valet parking for $40 a day or you can park in a public parking lot right behind the hotel for a small fee(minimal parking spaces). I decided to use the valet service because of the possible high risk car break theft. Located right on front of the hotel was a bike rental station and a ABC store a few steps away. The continental break was better than I expected. There was 2-3 options of fresh cut fruit, toast, bagels, 4 types of cereal, coffee, an assortment of break pastries, and different juices. There was no eggs, sausage, or biscuits but that breakfast was enough to hold you over until lunch. They also have washers($1.75) and dryers($1.50). If you happen to forget you detergent, they do sell some at the front desk. The hotel staff was mostly friendly but Miko was always super helpful and nice. No matter the time of day she always had a smile and a cookie for my daughter.

The rooms were both pretty clean and generally basic. The jr suite actually had more issues than the regular room such as: the thicker curtains do not close all the way to the edge, and one of the edges is closest to the head of the bed. I am not sure why this is, but it's irksome if you want privacy or want to sleep in longer when jet-lagged. However, the regular room had normal functioning curtains. Additionally in the suite, there was fluctuation in the water pressure of the shower. It was short lived but surprising (and again, the regular room was fine). Also while not a big deal to me, there was confusing channel navigation and unreliability when using the TV (I did not try the TV in the regular room). The AC in both rooms was right above the head of the bed, and even at the lowest setting and at the highest angle, it still felt too strong at times (and this is coming from a person who loves AC.) Bed linens were a slightly scratchy and a little too thin for when the AC is too strong. AC control was a little confusing for what some of the settings meant and some instruction for what those meant (like does the water drop symbol mean? Does it mean it's humidifier? or a dehumidifier? Is it different from the ""cool"" setting?) would have been nice. Finally there was a lot of street noise in the Jr. suite. I'm not sure why but if there's a rowdy crowd outside or from the karaoke bar, you will hear it, even from the 7th floor.Check-in was OK but having emailed Aqua corporate about the parking rates, I was quoted $35/day but the check-in form said $39/day. It was fine since on the first stay, I wasn't using a rental car, and reception said that they would make a note of it for my second stay. However, they did not and I was disappointed to bring it up again upon checking-in for the second stay. After much conversation and showing proof of the email, they did honor the quoted price and that was much appreciated even if only to save a few bucks.It should also be noted that due to Hawaii policy, you can be taxed on parking so those few dollars saved will pretty much cover the tax. Additionally when checking in, you will have to pay a $25 amenities fee (plus tax) per day for amenities (with the exception of Wifi) that you probably won't use (like getting the newspaper?). I wish this was just included in the reservation price so it doesn't feel like you're getting nickel and dimed. Despite all the quirks and irks, the location was pretty good and it felt safe regardless of locals telling me that Waikiki is kind of sketchy at night. The breakfast didn't appeal to me but it is in close walking distance to a popular udon place whose shortest line is in the morning. By far my favorite things about staying in this hotel were the generous welcome basket of goodies (chocolates, cookies, water, chips!), the washlet toilet and the rice cooker (nice touch even though i didn't cook anything) in the jr. suite, the closable curtains in the regular room, and the coin laundry (super handy when you get unexpectedly muddy while hiking). I'm not sure I'd stay here again but if I did, I'd consider the requesting a quiet regular room over the junior suite.","San Francisco, California","Nicole N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",4,3.0

I arrived at the hotel at around 4:30pm to be told that my pre-paid 1 bedroom Suite wasn't available for my stay and that they had a smaller Junior Suite instead for me. This was over the Christmas holiday so I knew that my chances of a finding a similar suite in Waikiki was very low. Aqua Oasis has 2 buildings....one where the Suites are and the other where the standard hotel rooms are. The two buildings are not joined so to get to the other, you need to go to the main floor, walk over to the next building and take the elevator. I ended up having to get a standard room in the separate building from my Junior Suite to house my family. This situation is not conducive to a great family-bonding vacation if we are in separate rooms and separate buildings. I left my business card with the Front Desk and asked them to have the Manager contact me regarding this manner by email and he/she never did which was very disappointing. Shows that they just didn't care.The central location of this hotel is very good. Breakfast was meh. Some powdered mini donuts, bread for toast, sliced oranges, sliced pineapple filled a hole.Valet parking only at this hotel. Both the day and night attendants were very good. The Junior Suite room was on back side of the building which was quieter so I recommend this. The room itself was comfortable (although much smaller than what I had booked). The bathroom was dated and needs to be refurbished. It had a large bath with sliding doors so it could be used as a shower. The edge of the bathtub was high and wide so if you had accessibility issues, you would not be able to safely and easily enter the tub for a bath/shower. I would not stay here again because their overselling negatively impacted my Oahu family vacay and because the General Manager did not get back to me as requested.

The things that are not walking distance can be accessed by using the hotel's free shuttle service. All in all I think if the hotel can do a facelift to the rooms and install diffusers throughout the property to give it a more pleasant smell that would do wonders. If you stay at the hotel opt for the Junior Suite or Suite rooms that have the kitchen the space is great.","Orlando, Florida","Dynamitetravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",172,4.0

The distance from the main avenue of Waikiki was convenient because we walked to the beach, restaurant, farmers market and shopping markets. There were bikes (Biki) that you can easily rent out, right in front of the Oasis. The staff members were friendly and were very helpful when we had questions or concerns.

I must say I was impressed with the staff the manager, the sweet lady working at the front desk, and even the gentleman who held my luggage honestly was amazing. I choose places based on service so I plan to return. I chose this hotel as a last minute choice. My other accommodations were near the military installation but I found myself in need of a hotel for a few extra nights. This place was a gem. Honestly the lobby was tranquil and quite nicely decorated. The rooms could use a bit more attention but were generally acceptable. I think a fresh paint job could really improve the rooms but I suppose this is a concern for the general manager, such a minor and quick fix to prevent diminishing this beauty. Great location walking distance to all great spots and honestly your people on staff at this location are the true value here. Oh and I enjoyed sitting with the resident turtles.

I told them we were going to drive the north shore and would be back about 6. When we got to the hotel at 610pm they told me our reservation had been cancelled. WHAT I ask them by whom and when. I was told that the general manager had cancelled it at 1208. That was 10 min after I had called and asked if our rooms were ready. WOW! I had the front desk young man call his boss who cancelled it. He did and we were told they could not get the credit card on file to accept a charge. I told them my credit card had been having issues since I was not in my home state. I told them the travel company I work through makes it so we dont pay til we check in so why were they trying to run my card without me present. I had other credit cards I could have given them. They said they called me, and I showed them my phone log, and they did not call me. So I asked for the head person of the hotel. She came down to the lobby and I asked her why she cancelled my reservation when she knew we were in town and going to be there. She told me the room had to be paid upfront. I told her my travel company has it set up so we pay when we check in. She then informed me I had no reservations and needed to leave her hotel.You see the Wikkki area was sold out, we had no where to go. Because we had a cheaper rate than what others had, cancelling our reservations let her book others in those rooms at a higher price. We were just asked to leave. They are a RIP off!! We did find another hotel after alot of effort, and my credit card worked just fine for them. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! The management only cares about how much money they can make.

On checking in, we were told that there would be a surcharge of USD 25 per day. I enquired about this but they could not tell me what it was for.

Everyone at the hotel was very friendly, but here are some observations:1. My wife and I were in a room with 2 double beds although we requested and confirmed a King bed - so much for a romantic getaway - we had to sleep in separate beds for 5 nights...the first time in 33 years of marriage...bummer!2. They sprung a $35.00 per day valet fee to park our car on us which was unexpected and unbudgeted - I can't find anywhere on their website where they specify the amount.3. Like most Hawaii hotels, the tack on a $25.00 per day hotel fee - as their website says, ""This fee allows guests to enjoy many resort services and activities without having to incur additional miscellaneous charges."" We never saw anything that justified the additional charge. Why not just publish your daily rate instead of tacking on all these additional fees?4. Continental breakfast is provided - pretty sparse, but we made due. The pineapple was pretty good. Also included 4 cereal choices and stale donuts. Incidentally, I saw one of the kitchen staff hand washing the breakfast dishes in a side room. I don't find that to be a sanitary means to clean dishes that other people use - I wonder what the state board of health feels about that....5. Our room could use a good cleaning - there were greasy hand prints all over the place including on all the doors and light switches.6. The swimming pool was slightly larger than a bathtub - this thing is so small you would have to step out of it to change your mind. We never used it, although it would have been nice after a long day - just too small.7. The dining area for continental breakfast is pretty small - if you want to get a table, you need to get there when they open at 7:00 am.If you are budget conscious and don't mind staying at a lower end hotel, this could be the place for you. It's close to the action, but as previously said, they have room for improvement.","Kilkenny, Minnesota","disc0dan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kilkenny, Minnesota</strong>",47,3.0

I'd read in earlier reviews that the rooms were loud, but ours was at the back of the hotel and we had no issues.A few things stopped it from being perfect; the kitchen wasn't well equipped (although the front desk sent up bowls, etc, when we asked) and could really use a kettle and a dishcloth.

The staff is wonderful, the rooms are nice, and the prices are reasonable. Breakfast is included from 7am-9am for all rooms, which is a nice touch (many of the hotels in this area did NOT include breakfast, or they only include it to people staying in higher-end rooms). The Junior Suite I stayed in had a full kitchen (full-size refrigerator, stove, microwave, sink, dishes, etc. The only thing it lacked was an oven.), its own private, furnished balcony, a large King sized bed, spacious bathroom (with the fancy electronic toilet that had a built-in bidet and dryer), a nice flat-screen TV (42"" or bigger), and other nice amenities.The major issue with this hotel (like all of the surrounding hotels in the area) is that parking is limited. There is a small, scary parking lot located on the backside of the hotel that charges $45(!!!) per day to park your car! Judging by the questionable people hanging around in that parking lot, I would recommend paying the hotel $30/day for their valet parking. It is secure, keeps your car safe, and the staff is prompt to get your car when you ask for it.Great ambiance, wonderful staff, and a convenient location makes this a hotel that I recommend you consider when staying in the Waikiki Beach area.

The pubs close at 4 am and we were woken up each morning around that time. I don't blame the hotel for the pub behavior though. We were on the sixth floor and the noise was still substantial as it is a narrow street.All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The valets went out of their way to be helpful.

We were here since my husband was on permanent change of duty station(PCS). This hotel was in one of the approved hotels for military on PCS. My husband called a different aqua hotel but they didn't have any availability at that time. We gave them our ""wish list"" -- pool, free parking, breakfast, laundry facility, gym and in Waikiki. Then we were referred to this hotel. This Aqua hotel checked mostly all the boxes except for the gym. I'm so glad we chose this one. They are very helpful and when you are on PCS it is very stressful. The hotel knows the process of TLA, they will match the rate in Schofield Inn as well. We didn't have to spend any extra money since their rate is just on the TLA hotel budget. The best thing I like is the free parking as well. Parking can be quite expensive, imagine having to pay $25-30 per day. Also, not all hotels in Waikiki offers free breakfast. Its not much: bread, pastries, hard boiled egg and fruits, but it helps. Its not a big hotel and that is a pro for me. In bigger hotels, the lobby gets crowded. You'll have to fall in line just to talk to the receptionist and when you are in PCS you just tend to get in touch with the receptionist more than checking in and out. Also, it is valet parking and most hotels in Waikiki are valet. Since this is a small hotel you can get your car faster than in larger hotel. This helps especially in the morning when you need to go to work at Schofield. You don't have to wait very long for your car. By the way, from here to Schofield it takes about 40min- 1 hr drive. The traffic is mostly getting into H1. But its opposite the traffic so its doable. We have a room on the 4th floor. Queen bed with balcony. Its dated but its ok. Comfortable bed. AC works. I just wish it has ceiling fan. A bit small too, but we have 8 luggages. There is small fridge and a table and chairs. The bathroom is big but the tub is awkward. Only one time I saw a cockroach inside the room but I think its because the door has this big gap under it. Since we stayed here for 43 days we almost knew everyone. They were very courteous. The hotel is clean. You can see staff always maintaining the area clean. They have a small garden with fishes and small turtle. Very peaceful. They have a laundry facility which again is helpful for military. Its also in the center of everything. Walking distance to the beach and all restaurants. Free beach towel and chairs. We definitely recommend this area not just for military family in PCS but also for tourists.

The Hospitality from the staff is just great. We also noticed that many of the employees are there year after year and they always give us a warm greeting when we pull up in our car. The smallness of the Hotel makes this place so much better than previous Hotels we stayed in. This only has 8 stories and we like to stay on the 7th floor in the Suite with the Kitchenette. It's got a good view and our room has a Lanai. They serve a nice Breakfast in the morning downstairs in the Lobby and even a paper next to the desk.

This seemed to be lower priced for the qualities of the rooms than I'd expect, maybe because there was construction going on, on 2 different sides of the hotel which I hardly noticed, but i guess it could take away some from your view if that's important to you.So the room seemed very nice and the a.c. was capable of getting the room very cold if you wanted that. They had a non stocked mini fridge, but there are near by stores that have all kinds of snacks and drinks including alcohol. Those stores also have things like beach ware and sunscreen. The room had and ironing board, iron, hair dryer and safe. I found the internet wasn't trouble free but worked well enough to get done what I needed to get done.They have a small swimming pool on the ground floor and a small koi pond, which was nice to sit by and have a drink. They have a restaurant and a continental breakfast which was fairly simple with bread, rolls, toaster, boiled eggs, juice.This is a good area for night life with plenty of restaurants that had bands and the main drag is near by with so many shops, more restaurants and plenty of things to entertain you when you go for a stroll at night with street artists such as ones who will do your portrait or break dancers or one man bands.It's not that convenient to the beach, but if you don't mind a bit of a walk, it's doable. It cost me $15 to get here by shuttle from the airport and I took the same thing back which picked me up right at the front door. I also went fishing as part of a tour that picked me up about a block away. They have a person there during business hours to help arrange any tours you might want to go on and the woman I dealt with was very pleasant and helpful. I took the shuttle out to Pearl Harbor which cost $15 and I called for a return trip with the same service. It's part of a regular root they run.

So we were eventually changed to a kind bed room, no view.On the second night I found a cockroach (about 1/2 an inch) crawling on the carpet - needless to say I didn't get much sleep after that.The room itself was very spacious, I think they put us in a disabled room. Lots of marks all of the walls and just the level of cleanliness was poor. There was no shelving at all in the bathroom or shower to put products, which was a pain. The air conditioning is the loudest I've ever heard, and the area is right above local bars and clubs so very noisy. The complimentary breakfast was terrible, some dry doughnuts, bread and crap coffee - absolutely no options for gluten free or even cereal. Even with the toast there was only very sugary jams to put on, they really need a bigger selection of condiments. The fruit was average - some pineapple and orange.On a positive note, the location is great - easy access to shops and restaurants nearby. We really enjoyed the new Thai restaurant downstairs, we came back to go there again with family. The shuttle bus was handy, but didn't make up for the room.After a few nights we moved to the Hilton to enjoy some luxury and better surroundings.

The quick synopsis, loved the place and would certainly stay again if in Hawaii.We stayed in a junior suite… The room was spacious enough for five of us. The room had two double beds and a sofabed. As well there was a kitchenette and the washroom had a washlet. The breakfast was basic but plentiful. The hard-boiled eggs, bread and pastries were great. I really was happy with this.The issues were small… Construction noise (never seems to stop but the room was reasonably quiet). The streetlight was directly across from the window and could not be covered with the curtains without some stretching.  Finally the electrical outlet plates were not aligned with the outlets. I used these for a multi USB ports and if you weren't careful this would fall out.The cost of the room, the very pleasant ambience and unbelievable location more than made up for this.Lots of great restaurants nearby and the rooms themselves were superb. Worthwhile to stay.","Toronto, Canada","zippydooToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

The location is excellent, the rooms are large (unusual for hotels in Waikiki) and it is moderately priced (again, for Waikiki). There is not much I can add to my previous review, only this time we were not upgraded to a Suite (more on that later). We had a Junior suite which is a little bigger than the base rooms but still large only costing a few extra $$ per night. Worth it if you want to spread out a little. Staff were friendly, helpful and the the rooms clean. The aircon in our room was quite noisy, so we had to have it blasting during the day and switch it off at night which worked fine.We booked via the website for a king bed, however on check in they only had two doubles. The lady at the check in said that there was the suite available but it would cost more to have that room. This annoyed me a little as we had booked via the hotel website a king bed and the only one available was the suite. It was vacant and I was a little surprised that it wasn;t offered as a free upgrade. If I had booked through a 3rd party site, no probs, but they encourage you to book through their website, but don;t look after you if an error or something you booked was not available. It has happened in the past (upgrade) and leaves a positive feel about the place. There is a lot of construction and renovating happening in Waikiki, so there will be newer and fresher hotels to choose from in the future which will put pressure on other more dated hotels to go that little bit further for customers.The above 'issue' is a 1st world problem, but in the highly competitive Waikiki market, little things like this help. It DID NOT detract from the stay, it is still an excellent hotel and when we return to Waikiki, this will be at the top of the list....again....If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good spot in Waikiki that offers large rooms, then have a look at this one.","Melbourne, Australia","btandrmb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",169,5.0

The Aqua Oasis is the exception. This hotel is centered in a good location in Downtown Waikiki. very close to beach and shops. It is not deep in traffic, or located on a main street, in which you cant even find the parking garage. It is off of Lewers street, which is not busy , so you can drive slow and actually get out of your car and not get ran over trying to get into hotel. Even though the hotel is small, it has the makings to be comfortable and relaxing. There is always fresh fruit at the desk, and free coffee and continental breakfast in the mornings. In the hotel is a fish and turtle pond, with a little garden for relaxing. There is also a little sauna, swing chairs and pool for relaxing. In the room, is a nice selection of furniture that makes you feel like you are on an island, and also on business. There is also a Free(Redbox looking) DVD/PS3 game rental station. This perc allows you to rent for free one movie or game at a time 24/7. Current releases and older stuff. Room has coffee, safe, fridge, hairdryer, closet, stool, sitting chair, bed, desk, Ipod input radio alarm clock, flat screen TV and a playstation 3. Internet is WIFI, and password is good for your whole stay vs each night like the big chain hotels. Bathroom has a huge soaking tube, and papaya scented shampoo, conditioner, bath wash, hand soap and lotion. Valet parking is 30 a day, and they know your name and bring the car down for you. Never a wait, and always at your pace. Overall, it is a 3 star hotel that feels like a high 4 that is quiet, and has everything you need. I prefer this kind of place rather then the big time chains, because I am comfortable and not stressed. Price point was under per diem by about 30 bucks a night, so it was a great deal.","West Grove, Pennsylvania","lildeucecoupe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Grove, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,5.0

We attempted to locate the source of the smell and discovered that it was coming from the air condition. We notified the front desk who then switched us to another room. The second room also had a moldy smell, although it was less strong. We both figured all the rooms had this problem so we just accepted the room change. Lucky my girlfriend brought some natural tea tree oil and lavender essential oils to spray in the room. It somewhat helped with the odor problem.Aside from the odor, there is limited space to keep your clothes. There were only 3 tiny drawers which of course could not be shared among 2 people. I used the 3 tiny drawers and hung up some clothes while my friend mostly lived out of her suitcase and hung up a few items in the closet. We had a laniai but The view in room 715 was not appealing (to say the least) as there was construction going on in the building across. Now for the good; The Aqua Oasis is one of the more affordable places in Waikiki especially if you have a package deal for air and hotel like I did from United Vacations. The staff was pleasant and friendly (as I experience with most Hawaiians) and the bed was very comfortable (and I am extremely picky about bed comfort). The hotel offers breakfast from 7-9 am which consists of bread, butter, jam, hard boiled eggs, donuts, delicious Hawaiian pineapple, pineapple juice and coffee. They also offer a shuttle service to go to the Ala Moana mall. I particularly loved the location.

There were three of us (husband and wife with our 8 year old) and there were two double beds. We sleep on a queen at home so we find a double quite small. The room itself felt quite spacious. No real drawers to put your clothes in if you like to live out of drawers (as we prefer to do when staying for a week) rather than a suitcase, but it was fine. Laundry facilities good other than the usual people who never read the instructions and put the detergent in the wrong place...The swimming pool is small, compared to how it looks in the photos, and it has a deep end (6ft) which still meant our 8 year old could jump in. And in fact, we had a great afternoon with a bunch of people from the High Fives Foundation around the pool, and they were much bigger than our boy (i.e. adults) and it worked well for them jumping in. There's no restaurant on site, but that's fine when there are so many around. The breakfast (served strictly 7-9am) in the morning is pretty basic (fresh fruit, mainly pineapple, pineapple juice, bread and bagels (can toast if you want), doughnuts and pastries if you're lucky). They are happy if you come down and take it up to your room. Most of the staff are pretty friendly.

The breakfast in the morning is very limited, so if you are a big breakfast eater - you'll need to go elsewhere.

Altho, eye surgery is fairly common, for some like me it can be uncomfortable. Now, let me start from the beginning... being from the neighbor island and traveling to oahu for a medical procedure can be trying and quite costly. Now, I want so be at a hotel where I will be comfortable, that is clean and convenient location. So, with all of these pleasantries in my wish list how on earth can I expect to travel with a budget.... I must be insane!! But, say hello to the AQUA OASIS... now we have stayed with them several times before..(.but to be honest many times we have strayed to stay within our means) You know, especially when it's not for pleasure. Anyhow, I do need to say, the staff is just absolutely wonderful, they do everything they can to bring you comfort. Mr. Yasu and his crew are spot on when it come to service. And I say this to our locals, you know, many a hotels will take a backseat approach to locals, and cater to the tourist WAY more than us locals...some hotels have this ""eh, you local, you no need attention"" , but here at the OASIS everyone gets the same great service. It's clean and comfortable. Their breakfast is quite generous in my opinion. Parking is only by valet.I would ask for a higher floor next time per street noise...(not the hotels fault) As i said, rooms are kept clean and comfortable.I only wish that they could work out something so those of us on a medical visits could stay there all the visits. I have recommended the AQUA OASIS to my place of work, all of my family and friends. I have an other doctor visit in December for another procedure, I hope to stay at the AQUA OASIS as it is the place to stay for comfort and peace of mind. Mahalo AQUA OASIS...

I'd suggest to put some of the key information in the room on a leaflet.Hotel is well located, walking distance to the beach, shops, restaurants and to the main street in Waikiki.The complimentary breakfast provided a minor selection of pastries, toast, coffee, jelly and pineapple juice. During rush hours in the morning, seating for breakfast is sometimes crowded but manageable. One drawback which is not the fault of the Hotel: constructions are going on at the opposite premises which makes it rather noisy in the morning. Not sure when this will be finished.

My last stay was at the Aqua Oasis and I will definitely be returning. Yasu handled my check-in at the front desk, when I arrived early with the intent of asking them to hold my bag while I went surfing. He not only found a room for me that was available right away but the room was an upgrade from what i had reserved. When I asked about moped parking, he directed me to the Valet, Mike, who found secure parking on the property at no extra charge. Both Yasu and Mike treated me like I was their best customer ever.Not sure if it's standard or not but the AC was already and the refrigerator cold when i entered the room. I liked that.I had selected the Aqua Oasis for this visit thinking that the deep soak tub was some kind of built in Jacuzzi and thought i'd be disappointed when i realized it was just an over-sized tub. I ended up enjoying the ability to just soak in it up to my neck. Very relaxing. I had not experienced a Bidet before but the one in my room proved to be an excellent benefit.Yasu inquired about my Wifi requirements and wasn't phased at all when I said I would be using a laptiop, ipad and the data side of mycell phone during my visit. He provided access codes for each one and said if i needed more to just let him know..I was concerned about outside noise and had read that other reviews said being close to the elevator was also a noise distraction.However, the elevator didn't affect me and there was almost zero outside noise once if i closed the lanai doors and curtains. Complimentary breakfast was also a nice feature. I'm not really a morning eater but being able to sit down and drink a couple cups of coffee and a glass of juice was exactly what i wanted.

It's hard to say something negative because the I didn;t get the room i paid for so the upgrade was a real surprise.The rooms are dated - pretty much ALL rooms are dated in waikiki except for a few newer ones (Trump for example) so the room was a good dated.It is close to the main drag and a short walk to most places.Value wise, it's a bit on the steep side but again, Waikiki isn;t a value destination.Overall not a bad hotel and would consider staying here again in a return visit.Breakfast isn't worth getting excited about as it is just a croissant and some other small pastries, if you can book a room and save a few $$ on breakfast, go for that option as you will probably head out and get another meal in about 1/2 hour anyway.","Melbourne, Australia","btandrmb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",169,4.0

The rooms were so light and airy with the most comfortable beds and were a great size ours had 2 double beds and a sofa bed. The bathroom was well appointed it even had a ""loo"" with lots of bells and whistles (I kid you not). Lovely big soft fluffy towels and toiletries topped up as needed. A breakfast was served every morning in the pool area. There was also a shuttle which ran hourly with frequent stops along the way as far as the zoo then out to Ala Moana shopping centre and back. We took advantage of the complimentary Beach chairs and beach towels from reception every day too. Another plus was having a laundry area on site.

Especially since I didn't want to break the bank with everything in Honolulu being so expensive and me just being there to fulfill an obligation. Here is the following tips when selecting this hotel: Location: While the location is about 5-7 minutes from Waikiki (depending on how fast you walk). It is a little off the beaten path. It is extremely close to GREAT restaurants and ABC stores. Be warned. As a single girl alone on vacation, I was very happy I had someone to walk me home at night. There are two bars you have to walk past and the crowd seems to get a bit sketchier the later it gets. There was never once that I felt extremely unsafe, I just had to be VERY aware of my surroundings. View: Please do not expect a view. Unless you enjoy looking at construction site and a Vietnamese restaurant. Literally that's it. I should have known better and asked for a street view room. At least that would have given me some people watching entertainment and not an unwelcome alarm clock thanks to the construction every weekday morning. Room: While they worked very hard to modernize the hotel. There are still aspects that are dated or need some love. For example the hallways are very dim at night and the bathrooms could use a little bit more updating. The closet is very small and there is only a rod on one side, which can make it difficult to hang clothing. Also, the walls are very thin so be prepared to hear your upstairs neighbors if they are nosy. There is only one housekeeper, Conchita. She is great and very sweet however, I didn’t get my room cleaned until about 3:00 almost daily which wasn’t bad but would be nice to give her some help. Pool: The pool is VERY small. Be warned. While there are lounge chairs that are by the area there are not a lot so it makes it difficult to over crowd the pool. The view isn’t the best from the pool but it is a great alternative if you are all beached out. It just wasn’t my first or second choice to catch some sun. Tips: When I checked in, my credit card was charged for the room and then charge $50 for an amenities fee. Being that I booked it on booking.com with no indication that there was an additional fee which annoyed me but the thing that really bothered me was that when checking in, it wasn’t mentioned at all. I didn’t mind paying the $50 but I felt as if it was being hidden which I didn’t appreciate. The hotel has beach chairs you can get for free. Use these beach chairs! The hotel will offer you a beach chair, all you have to do is ask at the front desk. These are 100% worth lugging them to the beach being that unless you want sand in your bag or to pay $50 at the Sheraton for 2 chairs and an umbrella. The best beach is between the Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian. It is sandy with no rocks and plenty of places to lounge around. Overall this was a convenient hotel location wise. While I might be a little too critical on my reviews I would have wished to read a little bit more about the cons before booking. I would have probably changed my mind in staying at the Aqua Oasis.",,410natalieb,2,3.0

Very noisy - earplugs essential to block out street/footpath & aircon noise. Well situated within walking distance to beaches shopping & pubs/eateries.Across the road from Waikiki Trolley base. We prepurchased tickets in Aus - 7 day pass - which gives access to all 5 lines. Grab a brochure & plan your journeys/tours for the day. ABC stores - ( plenty) local convenience stores - offer alcohol souvenirs sandwiches/rolls groceries etc. We enjoyed lolling on the beaches but lounge/umbrella hire pricey from $45 - $65 US for all day depending on part of Waikiki. If we had our time again I think staying at beach front hotels that have their own piece of sand with umbrella/lounges supplied may have been the best option.More expensive but would have suited us. Breakfast at Aqua Oasis basic but adequate - pineapple boiled eggs toast spreads pastries. With AUD exchange at the moment plus the tipping culture we found Hawaii very expensive eating out. Smaller bars eg Cuckoo Coconut a kind of pop up set up - in the next street over very enjoyable with live music most nights & cocktails to die for. Overall a pleasant 10 days & the Aqua staff very friendly & helpful.We worked out leaving a small tip for cleaner daily was usual practice so left $2- $3 with a thank you note each day. ,South Australia,"sammymay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Australia</strong>",11,3.0

This hotel has a great location in Waikiki for shopping and restaurants, but very noisy at night. If you have young children I would not recommend it as it is neighbours to 2 popular bars (kelley o'neil's and moose mcgillycuddy). So if you are young and want to party, good spot! The beach is a 5 min. walk, but I recommend walking 10min either west or east of hotel as the beach directly south of hotel is not the best (not a lot of sand real estate!). Actually, I recommend heading out of the city in any direction for a beautiful beach. North shore people!!!!Do not expect a view as building not very high (only 7 floors I believe so all the beachfront hotels obstruct any chance of a view) and rooms facing west face on to construction (and a small parking lot where people like to go at 3am to blast their car stereos as loud as they can, haha!). Luckily your room comes with ear plugs... They have a concierge in place. We used her services only once, but the time we did use her services we were disappointed. We were looking for a sit down Dim Sum restaurant in Chinatown and she sent us to a hole in the wall Take Out restaurant. Definitely no seating! When we returned to the hotel and told her, she said she had just googled it and it had good reviews, but had not heard of it before... Thanks.There is a Tiny pool and a few chairs to lounge (probably less than 10). Never went in... Its in a corner on lobby floor and surrounded by walls. Not inviting like at the Hilton or Hale Koa for example...***************So now for the piece de resistance! The reasoning for my ""Terrible"" rating is because of the difficulty I have been having after my stay...**********************As Ive said, this is my second stay here, and this has happened both times... After I got home the first time (May 2015) I had 4 or 5 different transactions on my card statement with numbers that made no sense. Charges of $2000, $500 and then some credits etc. The final amount worked out to be about what I had signed for so I left it alone... human error happens and it wasn't enough of a difference to bother with it.This last time...we (myself and 3 colleagues/friends) were there 25 Mar - 2 Apr 2016. We had a great rate worked out once again as we had booked through a friend who works as the coordinator/revenue-sales development for the brand in Oahu. We approached the desk upon check out and had them print out the charges.. we looked over the charges and realized there were some errors. We pointed out errors such as paying for parking on days we had not and paying for resort fees when we were told they would wave them. The lady at the desk kindly removed the fees and showed us the final balance of $1547.70 (deposit already paid at time of booking). We then split the charges between the 4 girls and they took our credit cards and processed them one by one. My share was $206.58 as I had paid the deposit. The lady told us we were all good and so we left for the airport.. When I got my CC statement, my CC had 5 different transactions from Aqua Oasis. $2776.42, $452.12, $1570.54 and then credits of $2641.00 and $166.58. Total balance; $1991.5 from my share... MORE than our total costs.When I tried getting a hold of them I was told it was because the other guests had paid and said that the balance was to go on my card (untrue as I was there and we then went to the airport together..) The second time I brought it up during a separate call I was told it was because one of the credit cards had not gone through (also untrue as my colleagues have statements to prove they paid in full). The third time I was told it was because there was a balance and they just went ahead and charged the card on file. I then got an email with their transaction breakdowns which do not match the print out we were given and the numbers still don't add up. They agreed to give me a refund of $1101.97 as even by their math I was overcharged, but getting half my money is not what I call a resolution. And I have not yet seen this amount returned... If you choose to stay here definitely beware of the charges to your card. Resolution is not easy and the stress and time this has consumed is not worth it. Almost takes away whatever relaxation I got from going on vacation...",,Caroline T,5,1.0

Hawaii is very expensive, but this is hotel is a bright spot for anyone who likes to hang onto their money. The hotel is a little dated, but it is very clean and the staff is excellent! Every interaction we had with the staff was very positive and pleasant. From our first interaction with the security guard who helped us find a good spot for our car, to the young man at the front desk who checked us in, everyone was friendly and very helpful. The parking valet attendants were always quick with getting our car (the garage is very close). $30 a night for valet parking (that is the only option here).The beach is a quick ten minute walk from the hotel. The hotel provides you with a beach towel card so you can ""checkout"" a towel for the day, which is very convenient. Within a block or two of the hotel you will find lots of shopping (some high-end shops on Kalakuau Ave too), many great restaurants, and bars. Overall, the area seemed very busy at night, but my wife and I did not feel unsafe at any time. The view from our room was not great. You cannot see the beach from this hotel.

In my mind though it was a good deal for the price compared to other places I looked at. The Jr. suite was nice sized with a kitchen area and we had a huge balcony that ran the length of the room. You can't see the ocean or anything but it did look out over the street. The location is great if you are just want to be in Waikiki. All of the shops, restaurants and beach are all within 5-10 minute easy walk. Many of the review I read are accurate. The staff are VERY nice and friendly. We never waited more than 5 minutes for the car, never more than a minute for an elevator. The room was dated but mostly clean. We did see a couple of small bugs in the sink and bathroom but we weren't overrun with them and nothing more than I occasionally see in my own house so I didn't pay much attention to it. Definitely the best part of the room was the fancy heated toilet seat with all of the bells and whistles. Breakfast was fine if you're in a hurry or just want to save a little money but it's nothing elaborate. Pineapple, orange slices, toast and muffins and fresh coffee. The manager's reception on Friday afternoon was nice. They served complimentary fresh pineapple and champagne drinks and had a guy singing and playing guitar. The concierge was always helping someone and seemed nice but we never used the service. Our room was facing Lewers Street and it did get very loud at night. Put the ear plugs in before you go to bed and you'll be fine. That kind of noise doesn't really bother us but if you're a light sleeper you might want to be on the other side of the hotel but no guarantee it's more quite over there.

The location is fantastic for such a reasonably priced hotel. One minute walk to the Main Street with restaurants and high end shopping. First two nights we stayed in room 705 which was on the seventh floor in the block nearest the sea. The room was huge. Bed very comfortable and the linens were great. Bathroom was big with a heated loo! But it was so noisy due to Moose McGilliguddys and an Irish pub being underneath so I didn't sleep too well for two nights. Full marks to Caddy Lee and Ryan for finding us a somewhat quieter room in the next block at the back facing the construction. Room 705 still on seventh floor. Yes it was quieter at least at night without the Harley's with noisy pipes and the cackling drunk women at 4am. But you are in the middle of Waikiki so it is noisy anyway. If you want quiet then I suggest you go further towards the canal. This room was a downgrade from the first room but it was almost the same size. Huge bedroom great bed good linens bathroom a bit smaller with out the heated loo! I will never understand why hotels put the air conditioner over the top of the beds. We had to keep turning it off as it was quite loud and open the sliding door to only hear the construction noise...oh well..They supply earplugs too. A ceiling fan would be a great idea. The flat screen TV was great with a selection of channels. Housekeeping was good. The staff were fantastic....full marks to them. The laundry is a great idea. Coin operated washer and dryer. Valet parking is $30 per night. Better than a parking ticket. Shuttle bus to Ala Moana is available FOC. if I was to stay again I would ask for a room on the back of the block nearest the canal. There are only two rooms that side and are much bigger than the front ones. The construction starts at 0600 so be warned.

Overall, we had a great experience. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The location is great for walking to restaurants and shopping, especially further down Lewers street. Even the beach is within walking distance. The only disadvantage to the location is the lack of ocean view, in fact our room looked at a building that looked abandoned. At least there were a couple palms next to our lanai to give it a more tropical feel. Our room was clean and comfortable with plenty of room for clothing and other stuff. There was a small table with 2 chairs, a flat screen TV, safe in the closet, and a large soaking tub with shower in the bathroom. Noise is an issue anywhere in Waikiki. We left our slider closed and the air conditioning on which was very successful in drowning out street noise. Ear plugs are also provided, but we did not need them. It would have been nice to have 2 sets of bath towels as we usually needed two showers a day between the humidity and being on the beach all day. The humidity just does not allow wet towels to try thoroughly. Our housekeeper was very friendly and did an ok job, but didn't go the extra mile like the housekeeper other family members had on another floor. A standard should be set and maintained for housekeeping services.The concierge, Sara Beth, was awesome. So friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, she was off 3 days during our stay. Mark, the valet, was another standout. He really hustled, opening and closing doors, loading bags and treating us like celebrities. At $30/day for valet parking, he made it more worth it when he was on duty.There was a complimentary continental breakfast each morning in the very comfortable clean pool area. One afternoon, at least, there was also a happy hour with snacks and complimentary mimosas.The Oasis is reasonably priced for Waikiki. We would definitely recommend it and stay there again.

I travel incessantly for work so I am pretty informed about the market. This has to be the best bargain in Honolulu. You can easily walk to every place you would want to go downtown- beach, mall, and tons of restaurants and stores. Ideal location in Honolulu. I wasnt familiar with Joy Hotels prior to coming to this one, however, based on my stay and the amazing staff, I plan on searching specifically for Joy Hotels on future trips. Rooms were comfortable and somewhat luxe for the low price. On site and free movie and game rental machine was something I have never seen in any hotel at any price. This would be especially good for a family with kids looking for ways to entertain in the evenings. Go for the kitchenette suites if possible;full kitchen and onsite laundry it will save you lots of money! Although there is some construction noise in the daytime, that is true everywhere in Honolulu given their is massive construction going on everywhere and the hotel provides u with earplugs to block it out. Best thing of all was the staff, especially Ryan at the front desk and Bellman/Valet, Mike. Ryan was cheerful and extremely helpful, never tiring of answering each and every question i had thruout my stay. Mike was kind and always attentive to the needs of every guest. This kind of service is usually impossible (in any city), to find at a hotel in this price range. I would recommend Aqua Oasis to anyone coming to Honolulu especially families!The only suggestion I would possibly make, is that they provide a soap dish in the bathroom.

No nocturnal decibel issues either. A discernable smell hit me upon entering the room, but it did not pose problems. Pool size is definitely not in the league of resorts. Breakfast, as many have written, is basic and in a cramped environment (thank goodness I'm not a breakfast person!). Shopping-wise, this is a great area for after office hours retail therapy, since most shops close at 11pm. ABC stores close slightly later. The luxurious DFS galleria is round the corner on the next street. A couple of farmers markets around. The complimentary shuttle to Ala Moana Shopping Center was much appreciated. When I asked reception about airport taxis, I felt they could have advised me about Charley's $29 flat fee taxi rate, which I eventually discovered through my own investigation. ",Singapore,"BigMamaAK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",61,4.0

I was pleased to get an email from the hotel, the day before our arrival, welcoming us to Honolulu. After a long day of touring Honolulu, my family was excited to arrive at our hotel. We were looking forward to freshening up and then hitting the streets to shop and get dinner. The hotel was in a great location to make this easy for us traveling with a three year old. We were quickly disappointed to discover the hotel no longer had our room (that had already been paid for the two nights) and it was only 5:30 in the evening. The front desk gentleman said the hotel was sold out. After a small discussion the desk clerk offered to put us up in a different hotel several blocks away (dinner/shopping options no longer so easy) and asked our tour guide, who was dropping us off from our tour, if he would mind taking us to our new hotel. WHAT??? Needless to say, the hotel did pay our cab fare to our new hotel and the new hotel was an upgrade from this one. My complaint is the situation should have been handled differently. First, our paid room should never have been given away. Second, we should of been notified of the situation BEFORE we arrived at our hotel. Third, we attempted twice to reach the manager and both times were told he was not available and he has not tried to contact us.

It is a small boutique hotel, very compact in design. The rooms are small but adequate, nicely maintained. The rooms offer no view of anything decent. The lobby is compact but pleasant. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Less than a 5 minute walk to the Waikiki beach. Valet parking (only parking available) was efficient, and cost $30/day. Very nice and helpful concierge in the lobby. This may be the best bargain in the Waikiki area considering that the other hotels in the area seem to run at least $100 or more per day.The drawbacks start with the breakfast. It was the most meager offering I have ever seen at a hotel-included breakfast. It consisted of hard boiled eggs, bread and rolls, not-very-good pineapple, pineapple juice from a can, and coffee. That's it. No cold cereal, no hot offerings. In addition, there were not nearly enough tables to handle the breakfast crowd even though there was plenty of room to add more tables. People were standing waiting for tables to open up, or sitting in the lobby trying to eat in the lounge chairs at coffee tables. Some people did not clean their dishes from the tables as is normally done in this type of setting, and there was no staff to clean the tables, so on some tables the dishes had piled up considerably with people trying to push them aside to make room to eat. My wife used the washing machines. One of them only produced hot water no matter what it was set on. The desk staff had to come over and fill the machine from a garden hose to get cold water. The washing machine area was dirty and not kept up. The bathtub area in our room had mildew and/or mold growing which is inexcusable.Be aware that in addition to the quoted cost for the room which for us was $141.30 per day, other charges, $30 for parking, $13.07 for one tax and $6.66 for another, and a hospitality fee of $15, will make your actual bill considerably more.All things considered, the Aqua Oasis is a bargain in that area of Waikiki. I am ambivalent about whether I would stay there again. I guess I would see if I could find other hotels that would be similar bargains in that area that would be at least as good, and if I could not find ones, I would probably default back to the Aqua Oasis.",Southeast Michigan,"cagey123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southeast Michigan</strong>",66,3.0

Although it may not have all the perks of the big name places like Trump and Hilton, you cannot beat the value you get at this hotel. The service is quality, the rooms are solid, and the price is unbeatable. I stayed here for almost 6 weeks on a work trip and they were the only hotel to work with me on a price that was within my per diem. I was willing to stay just about anywhere in Waikiki, but I would argue that they have one of the better locations in the entire area. It is just two blocks from the beach, right across the street from a giant mall with a large food court, and within walking distance of just about everything in Waikiki. My room was always kept in great condition by Angelita, and the front desk staff were always greeting me every time I walked by. My only two (minor) complaints about the hotel would be: 1- there is no gym, so you if want to workout you have to go to an actual gym in the city. This was OK for me since I had a car, but it would have been much more difficult if I had to walk. 2- The breakfast selection is very minimal and gets boring after a couple days. The choices are toast, boiled eggs, pineapple and a pastry. If they charged a few extra dollars for a greater variety I would have been happy to pay the cost. Other than that, this hotel was great and met all of my business needs. The wifi worked perfectly the entire time (something that would be a dealbreaker for me) and the A/C was more than sufficient for long days on the phone. I would highly recommend this hotel for people that want to be in a great location in Waikiki, but do not want to pay the exorbitant prices of the big name hotels.

The continental breakfast was a joke. They offered canned pineapple juice, toast, and prepackaged muffins. Also, it's offered outside so birds often go into the food.

Dexter is also very friendly.As regards the structure there are no particular negative to mention.As many have written of possible external noise due to nightlife.Honestly we did not bother us at all. I was also a room on the back side of the road where the evening felt well and I could catch sight the Hard Rock Cafe. At the beginning it is assumed that the parking of $ 30 a night is expensive, but absolutely worth it and after all is well, if not cheaper, than others in the area.Unfortunately at Waikiki find a parking spot is a fortune. This Hotel offers different services and things available. We recommend it fully. If I was to return to Oahu, definitely I stay there again. The small negative thing is breakfast: the choice is limited, but the problem is that unless you arrive early in the morning, then it runs the risk of not finding nothing or very little available.",Switzerland,"Naughty-Cougar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Switzerland</strong>",102,5.0

It is a very nice hotel in the center of everything in Honolulu. We didn't spend much time in the hotel, but were busy going to Waikiki Beach, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, etc.Con's-- We arrived on a Thursday and traffic was CRAZY! We couldn't find out where to park and driving around the block took almost 30 min! Finally I parked in front of the hotel and went to the front desk to ask where the valet guy was! They only had one!We found ants in our kitchen and they stayed with us the entire 3 days we stayed despite telling the front desk on 2 separate occasions.WiFi was terrible- I complained repeatedly about the poor WiFi in our room and they finally refunded the resort fees.Pro's- Reasonable rates, clean rooms, well decorated. They gave earplugs in the rooms but we never heard any sounds at night.Staff very friendly and willing to help. Plenty of places to eat and shop nearby within walking distance. 2 General stores nearby for groceries.The breakfast was free which is why I gave it a ""Pro"" however most Americans would find it lacking. Basically some fruits and bread.Overall a great hotel if you are looking to save some money on a nice hotel that isn't on the beach but is within walking distance to everything!","Tampa, Florida","gator0178</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",71,5.0

He even sent extra water bottles since I'm pregnant and can't drink. It was so thoughtful. The rooms were nice enough. Clean, well-kept, and comfortable beds. They also have a play station 3 in the rooms and a DVD box (similar to red box) in the lobby where you can rent movies. These services are included in the hospitality fee. So take advantage of it! There is also a small pool. The breakfast was small. It consisted of toast, muffins, fruit, some pastry choices, and beverages. But it was still tasty. You can tell that the employees are making a strong effort to make the Aqua Oasis the place to stay. Throughout our stay every time we ran into an employee, they were friendly and always struck up a conversation with us. And it is a great location! Everything is just a short walk away.

As we did not rent a car we caught a shuttle from the airport, we rode on the Speedieshuttle and the cost roundtrip was $59.00 for two, arrangements for return pick up were taken care of at the time of our original pick up. Trip advisor needs a stand alone category for public transportation, shuttle service and cabs as we had a difficult time getting reviews of local services. Our driver was an incredibly nice guy and made the trip to the hotel very enjoyable and informative. It is not a direct trip to the hotel but made stops at four different hotels in Waikiki, all the hotels are fairly close so it did not take long for us to get to the hotel. We were a little early for check in so the front desk secured our bags and we went out for a bite to eat. There are numerous places to eat nearby, priced for all budgets. What we found is that is that we could expect to pay at least $25.00 for the two of us plus the tip for burgers and fries, or a simple breakfast of eggs bacon and toast and coffee. It did not seem to matter how simple the meal was, it was $25.00 average. We were checked in ahead of schedule and retired to Room 415 it was a street side room and indeed did have earplugs on the night stand for our convenience, we had no issues during our stay with street noise, club noise or noise in general. The room itself was a decent size and the bed was very comfortable (firm) and had a variety of pillows (4). The room had a more than adequate air conditioner, it was mounted over the bed which seemed different but it kept the room more than cool enough. The room had a small table with two chairs and a large closet with plenty of hangers, the only thing that may have been lacking was drawer space. We had a small balcony that had two chairs and a small table on it. We spent little to no time out there but it was nice to have. Regarding the bathroom it had more than enough towels and was well supplied with soap, shampoo and conditioner, it was very well lit. I never broached the subject of the shortcomings of the bathroom with the manager during our stay I covered them in a survey that I completed when we returned home, had I pointed these things out as I discovered them I would have expected that they be remedied but as it was we could live with it as it was. The towel rack was about to come down and the toilet paper holder was less than secure. The bath tub was huge but the finish was chipped, It just was not too attractive, some of the caulked joints around the tub were suffering from some mildew not a huge amount but noticeable. The ring around the recessed light that was in the area of the tub was only partially secured and the ceiling was in need of a good coat of paint. Now if I was paying the rate I paid for this room in Des Moines, Iowa I would have expected a lot more for my money but in all honesty considering the location of the Aqua Oasis which was within 1/2 mile of Waikiki Beach I think this hotel at the rate we paid was a very good bargain. Price what other hotels are charging, our room was worth what they were charging. In addition the hotel had a modest breakfast available, and good coffee! Beach towels and lounge chairs were also available. We found the staff to be polite and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.","Iowa City, Iowa","Bountiful-IA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Iowa City, Iowa</strong>",175,3.0

The receptionist see's us and doesn't seem to care that we are struggling and tired. So we manage to drag all our bags on our own to this tiny elevator which we require to do two trips in because its so small. We finally arrive in our room tired and exhausted instantly noticing cockroaches on the kitchen wall then to top it all off we unfold the fold out couch to discover the mattress is merely a double instead of a queen as posted in the description! Being so tired my girlfriend and I just try to put up with and get through the night on the very uncomfortable tiny bed(im 5'6"" on a good day and my feet were over hanging!). To add to our already terrible sleep we are woken at around 3 in the morning to the sound of the elevator which was so loud it sounded as though it was in the room.First thing in the morning we head to reception in attempt to sort out the bed situation as the bed was unbearably uncomfortable and small. We speak to the lady and ask if she can assist us with changing the bed or possibly changing rooms but she was unable to do anything besides offering us pay for an extra room almost $500 extra on top of the already $1200 we paid for 4 nights. We kindly refused the offer and asked to speak to a manager in hope to organize something more suitable. Almost 4 hours later we finally get a call from the manager to come discuss the situation and we head down to see the manager to explain the situation. He sends maintenance to have a look at the bed and returns saying there's nothing wrong with it. We say this isn't good enough and ask if an alternate arrangement and he instantly began to be arrogant and rude towards my dad and I. Then he began to say there was no other rooms available and nothing he can do even though the receptionist told us earlier there were. We explain the bed isn't what we paid for and very uncomfortable instead of being sympathetic he is arguing with us and saying there isn't anything wrong it with an arrogant smile on his face even asking the maintenance guy in front of us what size the bed to belittle us.In the end we asked for a refund which he was happy to do because he'd rather put us on the street then help us with our issue. Almost ruined our family holiday in Hawaii luckily we found something alternate on such short notice.

The location is perfect: doesn't get much more central than this. You can walk to everything in central Honolulu, including Waikiki beach. They even provide towels and beach chairs to borrow. The downside, of course, is that it's noisy and busy. Our first night on the 4th floor was cut short by the racket of a 6AM garbage pickup, and I can't imagine what the weekend party crowd would do to someone on the lower floors. Let's just say they provide complimentary ear plugs for good reasons. The hotel has recently been renovated, and while the décor is nice enough, the attention to detail is pretty sad – it isn't going to look fresh for long. The complimentary breakfast is also kinda sad – the fresh cut pineapple and decent coffee the two redeeming features. But, hey, it's complimentary. The pool is tiny and could be swapped out for a hot tub to everyone's advantage. Nice relaxing hangout zone, but the public spaces are tiny and cramped. None of the rooms have much of a view, and even though they all have balconies it's not particularly inviting to sit outside overlooking construction sites and back alleys. The staff are friendly and provide decent service. Above all else, however, this is by far the best deal in Honolulu – a “real” hotel at a competitive rate. Make sure to check out their “lowest rate guarantee” and prepare to be the squeaky wheel to get the rate you should be given. Valet parking at $30 a night is not cheap, but it's extremely convenient in a city where parking is a pain in the neck.","Norwich, Vermont","Lars B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwich, Vermont</strong>",17,4.0

Everyone had a smile and would help in any way they could to take care of ou needs. We stayed at the hotel this month and found it to have a very international clientele. Most of the guests were Asian and the staff that we encountered also spoke Japanese. From my observations and interactions with other guests, few guests seemed to be from the U.S., but were from Japan, Australia, Canada, etc. The Aqua Oasis offers a continental breakfast--not much of a selection. If you want cereal and milk you will have to purchase it at the store on the corner. Coffee, juice, tea, toast, muffins, hard boiled eggs, pineapple and orange slices. We asked for a king-bed and we learned that all of the king rooms are located on the Lewers side of the hotel. You will want to avoid that side because of the street noise. Interestingly, the hotel anticipated that problem and provides ear plugs on the bedside table. We changed rooms the next day and found the two-double bed room to be more spacious and on the opposite side of the building. It was still too noisy to leave the sliding doors that open to a small balcony open, but, if you turn the AC on, it drowns out the other sounds. There is much construction going on in Honolulu and some of it is near the hotel. The beach at Waikiki is only a block and a half away--small blocks--so your walk there is a quick one. The hotel provides free towels and free beach chairs! Valet parking is available for a fee and we found that service to be quite expeditious. We used the coin-operated laundry on the first floor before we left. Using it during the dinner hour assures you an uninterrupted period where the machines are all yours! There are ample eating establishments on Kuhio. Eating out in Waikiki can be expensive, so look around for values. I recommend Marukame Udon on Kuhio for a delicious and relatively inexpensive meal. Wi-Fi is also available at the hotel.

Our bags arrived a few minuted later and we were shown everything about the room. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, the A/C worked great and kept the room very cool. The bathroom was large with a large oval tub. My only complaint about the bathroom is the water pressure for the shower head was very weak. I'm all about water conservation but a little more water pressure would have been nice. We had a large balcony overlooking Lewers Street. Noise was never an issue at night unless you were had the sliding glass doors open. They provide free beach towels and folding beach seats at no charge. The location is excellent, close to shopping, restaurants, bars and close to the beach. There is a continental breakfast every morning which I disagree with others and thought it was nice. Most Waikiki hotels don't offer anything other than a $15 to $20 breakfast. It consisted of hard boiled eggs, a variety of pastries, hot coffee and fresh fruit. The wifi was fairly good but had its moments. There is an area to wash the sand off you at the entrance as well as a shower at the pool. Valet parking is $30 but it is Waikiki after all.

The location is walking distance to everything and conveniently located just behind the main hub of Lewers street so that is a plus.The hotel has had a lick of paint and a small face lift, but still shows signs of age and a little haggard. In saying that the rooms are very clean and the bedding is new and extremely comfortable. We had a PH suite with ocean views and of the fireworks on the Friday night, so that was awesome.

I got a room that had a nice kitchen, a 2 burner stove, a newer frig, coffee pot, toaster, microwave and everything you would need to cook. All the silverware, pots, pans & dishes, cups and glasses. Nice. The room was nice and had a couch also along with a large flat screen TV. The bathroom was large also. The cleaning service did a very good job. It also had a very large balcony. It was about 8' x 20' and had a couple of lounge chairs and tables along with a lounger. And the closet was very large also. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Those are the positives, now the negatives:The don't tell you that parking is $30 a day. That seemed on the high side and you are not able to park yourself. You must use their valet service since they share a parking lot so there's another fee (tip) for the valet.I mentioned that the closet was very large with lots of hangers but they only had 3 very small drawers. Like sock drawers. So you must leave your shorts, t-shirts etc. in your suitcase.I pointed out that the balcony was very nice but the view sucked! Besides viewing other hotels, condo's and office buildings right across the street was some kind of a bus transfer station. Apparently it had been recently renovated and the yard out front had turned into a junk yard. Lots of junk out there that had been replaced with new items. The pedestrians couldn't see it as a 8' tall plywood wall had been put up along the sidewalk, but all of us who were up high had a very disturbing view. I'm really surprised that this hotel and the other high rise owners who have to look at this haven't complained to the city to get it cleaned up. I was here for a week and I never saw a single person inside of it so obviously it has been put out of the owners minds.There is a $15 per day ""resort fee"" here. It is supposed to include internet and a ""continental"" breakfast. I was never able to connect to their internet and their definition of a breakfast is different than mine. They had coffee & juice, bread for toast, muffins and fruit. No cold cereal and nothing hot. This might hold you over until you could go elsewhere to get a real breakfast.

The housing we thought was lined up for us before we arrived, wasn't and we spent the first three weeks hotel hopping. After some almost comedic BAD experiences (see other reviews) I finally was able to reserve us for 30 days at the Aqua Oasis...which, due to more housing issues, had to be extended another week. Initially, I wasn't that impressed with the hotel. It's right in the heart of Waikiki, but if you blink, you'd miss it. I drove around the block twice before finally seeing where it was. The room was clean and we had a nice large balcony....again, initially, I wasn't that impressed because our balcony overlooked dumpsters, a Korean food joint and a parking lot - BUT on Friday nights, we had an excellent view of the fireworks that go off at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Another negative is the noise level at this hotel. It's next to a Karaoke bar, plus Moose McGillycuddy's is two doors down and Kelly O'Neill's is across the street. If the AC was off, you could hear music until pretty late at night...especially for some reason, in the bathroom. However, the longer we stayed at the hotel, the more we liked it. We were centrally located in Waikiki - basically across the street from PF Changs, Hard Rock Cafe, great shopping and just a short stroll to the beach, the zoo, or a longer jaunt to the Ala Moana (they do offer shuttle service, but I preferred to walk). As a runner, I LOVED the proximity of the hotel to the running circuit around the Ala Wai canal. They have beach towels that you can check out and beach chairs, and there's always wonderfully refreshing lemon infused ice water in the lobby awaiting guests at the end of a hot, Hawaiian day of sightseeing. The staff were all friendly and helpful and endeared us to them by telling us, after we had been there for about three weeks, that we were ""like family"". At the end of it all, though we are SO happy to finally have a home, we were a little sad to leave. Our overall experience there was very positive and given the chance, I would stay there again.","Monterey, California","gretchiekc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monterey, California</strong>",85,4.0

So happy I picked this hotel. Location was great. It's within a 5 - 10 minute walk to the beach. Why spend $$$ more to be on the beach when you can use that money towards other things, like in our case, we rented a car. Used the car to literally travel ALL over Oahu. The money saved using Aqua Oasis was best spent on a car so we can experience this pretty island. We did so many excursions on our own with the car. Got to go to Pearl Harbor (meanwhile if you pay for an excursion from Honolulu, it's easy $40 something a person). We went to Hanauma Bay. Went to hike Diamond Head. Went to Pipeline beach at the north shore. Aqua Oasis lets you borrow their beach towels and beach chairs. We took them to Waikiki beach with us and packed them in the car when we went to Hanauma Bay. The towels are small as are the beach chairs (they are the just sitting kind) but they are good enough and it's awesome to have that option. It's honestly the little touches like this that make your stay pleasant. The room was newly renovated, very clean. HUGE bathroom. Comfy bed. AC blasted. The view off the balcony was blahhh but can't complain. Love having the balcony to air dry our bathing suits and gym/hiking clothes. The service at the front desk was pleasant, polite. Only downsides are the price of their valet parking. Very pricey but there is a parking lot located off to the side and behind the hotel, where you pay this machine. Different pay structures based on time of day. Still somewhat pricey but worth it.Also odd is that when you bring in the beach towels back to get your ""towel card"", they make you go back to the entrance where you have to stick it in their hamper. That was kind of odd, but it's fine. Also - I sort of liked the lobby. It was basically outside and they built this ""covered"" area with plants. Pretty cool.Lots of souvenir shops nearby and restaurants. Very close to Waikiki beach.For the price, feel comfortable knowing you'll be pleased with this hotel in Honolulu.",NYC,"LuljaNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",62,4.0

Property: The rooms were small but upgraded. Enjoyed the decor and it was cute. There were one small cleanliness issue in the bathroom on the door. There was a balcony in the room which was nice but it overlooks a construction site so not much to see here. They didn't really do much renovation to the lobby area and it looked more like a converted pool deck. The bed in the room was very comfortable and the air conditioning was working well which is really what you need in Hawaii. Internet was fairly good.Breakfast: There was a breakfast that we didn't take advantage of. It stops serving at 9 AM and since we were on holiday, we didn't have plans to get up and go down for breakfast in a hurry. For a resort, one would assume that this amenity would be more suited to visitors and not business folks.I stayed here due to the rave reviews regarding service, but I found that the service was absolutely mediocre at best. We checked in with Kevin who didn't smile once during the whole experience. We called down to ask another agent about activities that didn't involve much walking and was told about hiking trails nearby. I found the service to be uncaring or that they didn't listen/read their guests. The staff constantly shout interactions with each other across the lobby area which is quite alarming.Overall, the hotel is okay and not sure if I would stay again.

My hubby and I arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon of May 15, 2014. The first thing we noticed was how friendly the staff was. Check in was a breeze. When we got to our room, there were several yummy surprises waiting on the dresser as well as two cold bottles of water. That's what I call hospitality. Even at the chain hotels we normally stay at, you rarely get water waiting in the fridge for you that is free. The king-size room was an adequate size, was clean, and the bed comfortable. Space in the regular king size bedroom would have been tight if you were staying long-term. The bathroom amenities were very nice and the quality of the towels was nice too. Besides the lack of storage, which wasn't a problem for us staying two nights at a time, the only other thing was there was only one elevator. However, having said that, we never had to wait long. The hotel also offers a continental breakfast. We are big breakfast eaters so we normally went elsewhere. The hotel is very close to restaurants, shopping, the beach, and bus lines. We did not rent a car, but used the bus when we wanted to go further away. Dexter was particularly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. My sister had flight problems and was delayed in arriving a whole day. When I explained the situation to the hotel management, they treated her and her hubby extra special. We departed the hotel on May 17th to go on a cruise of the islands. We returned to the hotel for two additional nights after the cruise. Again, we had yummy surprises and cold water in the room. The only thing that we didn't particularly like was when we left. My hubby wanted to use the luggage cart to bring down our luggage and the bellman would not let him take it. We did use the bellman's service each time we arrived, and the first time we departed. Once we brought the luggage down by ourselves, Dexter and the bellman were nice enough to help us get it to the taxi. All in all a good stay with friendly staff.

The hotel was 2 blocks from the beach, very close and nice walk. This hotel is located next to many restaurants and the main strip of Waikiki. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a good hotel for a good price. I will be coming back to Oahu soon and I will stay here again!",,smokezz03,3,5.0

The location was great; couple bars on the same street, main waikiki attractions were minutes away (walking distance). There is a karaoke bar located in the hotel. They have a rather small poll but you do have the option of going to anot her hotel for a bigger pool. However, when in hawaii, why go to the pool. The beach is just minutes away.","Waipahu, Hawaii","islandgrown96706</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waipahu, Hawaii</strong>",1,4.0

Check in was a breeze but did not get to see my room until the evening since I am bringing my associate to the airport for her flight back. Room is spacious, clean and quiet, There are two wings in the hotel and all rooms have balcony. This is a block away from the beach so don't expect a beach view balcony. Location is terrific, right next door to DFS. Walking distance to everywhere within the Waikiki area and street is very safe no matter what time you get home. The only hassle is it is valet only parking. Pool is small but you don't come here for the pool since the beach is just a block away. Staff is amazing. I am already in my car after checking out when I realized I forgot my tablet in the bathroom. I quickly ran to the front desk and staff handed me back my room key. Found my tablet. As soon as the elevator opens up, my valet driver was on his way to see me because I left my phone while checking out. That was going over and beyond the his responsibility. I am definitely going to stay again in this hotel on my next visit.","Las Vegas, Nevada","jojoc87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",3,5.0

We had a great experience across the board. The hotel is in an ideal location that is within walking distance of the beach and most major restaurants. All of the rooms had recently been renovated. The upgrades to the lounge area contributed to the relaxed atmosphere.The entire staff was friendly and helpful...they treated us like family throughout our stay. The valet drivers not only took care of our vehicles, but they also provided a wealth of knowledge of the area. In one instance the battery in our car died and the valet driver used his own vehicle to jump start our car...then he gave us directions to the nearest shop that could service our vehicle. The maid service was very good and the their staff members were extremely friendly. They knew knew that we had four people staying in the room and provided additional pillows and blankets without us having to ask. The guys who put out the breakfast every morning were very thoughtful. Breakfast was typically not served until 7am. When they saw that I had to leave by 645am to take my son to school, they started serving the food 15 minutes early so that we could grab a quick bite to eat.The front desk staff was awesome. Not only did they ensure that we had a pleasant stay every day, but they absolutely looked out for our safety. There was a tsunami watch during our stay. As soon as the watch was issued, the hotel manager worked with the front desk to move my family to a higher floor just in case something did happen. We were not overly concerned about the tsunami watch, but it was nice to know that the hotel staff was looking out for us. My children had a blast hanging out at the hotel. The front desk staff would always talk to my children and routinely give them high fives. They even let my children feed the fish and turtles on most days. We absolutely recommend this hotel and will stay there again when it comes time to move.Ask for Dexter, he will take care of you!","Honolulu, Hawaii","Jeremiah R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",3,5.0

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Dexter was great he helped us out on our last day with a late check out due to our flight time. The rooms were newly renovated just a few weeks before we arrived. They are spacious, clean and pretty. The different colored lights above the doors into the rooms in the hall ways were a very nice touch to the hotel. Made me feel like I was in a Miami resort. They have a nice continental breakfast every morning, the front lobby had these neat oval hanging chairs that were fun to swing around in and they have a beautiful and relaxing koi pond to sit next to if you're a smoker. Over all this hotel was great I would definitely recommend this place to others.

But great for those on a budget who want the best room for the price. If you want to browse some of the best ""high end"" shopping in Honolulu and eat at some great restaurants this is really an ideal location, We stayed here for part of our trip to Oahu and really enjoyed it. Also, it's a very easy walk to the beach. There are some exceptional places to eat and relax nearby - like the restaurants at the Halekulani. There are no private beaches on Oahu so all of the resorts have to allow public access. From this hotel to the beach is, in our opinion, one of the best beach areas around for relaxing. This hotel is small - a ""boutique"" hotel. But the rooms are very comfortable and quiet. It's an older facility; but it's been well taken care of and kept up. The beds are extremely comfortable, the towels are good quality and you get really nice soaps and lotions. The pool area is very small and it's outdoors by the front desk. The breakfast is pretty basic (sweet rollls, juice and fresh fruit). The staff was wonderful! They wanted to make our stay pleasant and comfortable - and it was and we'd stay here again for sure.",Arizona,"lifeisverygood2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arizona</strong>",191,4.0

We walked into the room and it still smelled of freshly cut wood! Everything was so beautiful and modern and new, we instantly felt comfortable and at ease. The staff were so welcoming and accommodating which made our stay that much better. We were a young couple so we liked that the location was right on the strip with a few local bars we could hop to and being one street back from the main drag it was quiet and not as busy for the nights we didn't feel like going out!Continental breakfast was always fresh, and the property includes free towels and beach chairs everyday! BONUS! only downside is if you have a car it's about $25 USD a day to park on their property When we left the hotel, we were left with some macadamia nut cookies and a hand written note from our housekeeper AndreaCheers Aqua!
