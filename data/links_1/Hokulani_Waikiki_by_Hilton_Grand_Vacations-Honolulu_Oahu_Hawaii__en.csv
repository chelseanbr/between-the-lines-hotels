About a block or so from the beach. Lots of eating options nearby but we were also able to cook some small meals in the kitchen. There was a drip coffee maker and a rice cooker. Pots and pans were also good quality. We stayed for a week so cooked several of the days. Very large bathroom which probably appeals to many guests, underutilized by us as a long soak in the tub seemed less interesting than all the loveliness outside. Parking attendants were great, very efficient. $40 a day is a lot but you are in the heart of the tourist area. We did drive out most days and found it convenient to see areas other than Waikiki. But also enjoyed just walking to things nearby so probably would still stay in same area if we come back. Staff was very friendly. Some downsides. Bed was very soft. We were on the 5 th floor above the AC and near the street. Both were loud so we could not keep the patio doors open. We had asked to switch but they said they were all booked.

The bidet-enabled water closet was also a nice touch, self-contained from the main bath. The fridge initially looked small, but it was quite than adequate for us. We were able to make our own meals for the vast majority of our meals, taking down the Waikiki vacay price tag considerably. The bed was clean and comfortable, and there was a sofa bed as well, in case of an extra guest, which we didn't need. Dishwasher was a bit noisy, but it worked well and saved us some valuable time.

It is at a perfect spot to go and do things. I gave it five stars for this. We checked in on a Saturday, and stayed til the next Saturday. I am an RCI member, and on a family budget, and by the time we left from our 7 days, our bill from the resort was $305.90!! BEWARE OF THIS!! On the website for this property, RCI does tell you about the $30/day, but it still was a shock. The charge was $30/day and $9.00/day fees w/o tax. I asked what we were given for the high fees, and were told we get the use of the facilities and 2 bottles of water a day. I liked the free washer/dryer and they did supply us with laundry detergent (not softener). We didn't rent a car. We used Uber to and from the airport, which with tip, was around $33.00 each trip. I liked the resort, as it's a 15 min. walk to the largest mall, and just across the street from another large mall. Denny's was just down the street (5 minutes walk), and we mostly ate at the food court of the malls. Budget yourself around $50 a meal for 2. The Trolley system was great! It was about 5 minutes away as well, but you have to walk thru the Galleria mall to get to it. We thought the trolley was public transportation by all the flyers, but they were actually tours. We just decided where we wanted to go for the day, and hopped on the colored trolley that went by the place we wanted to go. It wasn't really all that expensive to get trolley tickets. We bought ours for the week even before we got over there. We went to Pearl Harbor by way of the trolley, as well as the palace, and the circle island stops it made. It was nice just hopping on one and seeing where it went, and just enjoying the breeze as you went places. I will not stay at this resort again! Not only did it charge a lot of points to stay here, but the fees were just too much, and I expected more from a Hilton property. I could of stayed down the walkway at the Embassy Suite and had a breakfast provided and not have to stay so long, as 7 days was too long. We did come in a day early and stayed at the Embassy Suite with points. We felt like we were in Hollywood, with the high end malls all around us (if that is your thing, but it wasn't ours). At least there were ABC stores all around to get souvenirs from, as well as snacks and sandwiches. I didn't see any grocery stores around to go and buy food items. But, then again, I didn't ask the concierge either. But, we did walk all over the place. ",,BoardingPass769024,3,5.0

To access the beach, I recommend going through the Royal Hawaiian Mall, all the way past Dukes and Blue Note to turn down the public access with the surfboard storage on either side. It is about 2 blocks. Other ways are more difficult if you want to access the main part of the beach.  The hotel has a rooftop sun deck and bar, but sea views are through other hotels. Still, it is a better view than what the Ritz-C has. The rooms-suites are great! The hotel staff goes out of their way to make your experience better than just good enough.  In the room, there is room to store groceries and a small cooktop for some cooking. If that is desirable, then I recommend going from the airport to Costco / grocery store, then to the hotel.

There is a PlayStation 4 with free games located in the lobby. Also the dvd's were also free. There was a balcony access from the living room across to the bedroom. The bedroom had a king bed. The lighting was very modern and contemporary. There is a safe for your valuables in the dresser. There's a TV in the bedroom. The bathroom was an event! The shower had an overhead raindrop fixture as well as a hand held shower head with a glass door entry. The free standing bathtub has a waterfall feature from the ceiling. There was a heated seat on the commode with a bidet! There was a vanity station. Just lovely! Now if all of that wasn't enough, how about a TV in the bathroom mirror? Just fabulous!Do yourself a favor and book now! Right now! You will not be disappointed! There's no need to rent a car. Everything is in walking distance! Its beautiful!

I cannot day enough about the service received by this hotel, especially by Brian. We saw him all hours of the day from the early morning to the late evening. He and many others made sure we were wellInformed about the hurricane updates. The staff worked tirelessly throughout a very stressful situation, even remaining there when Waikiki was literally shut down and they probably had their own homes and families to tend to.The location is fantastic, better than the Hilton Hawaiian Village where we normally stay. The guys at the valet always had the car ready for us with a smile, despite me going back and forth several times a day.The rooftop pool is small but beautiful and the space is relaxing. I like that the cabana’s were complimentary and the furniture comfortable to lounge and watch tv. The bartender there also was personable.Housekeeping was detailed and our room was cleaned twice during our stay. We appreciated having the laundry room available for use.The room itself was modern and spacious for us to share. We were a family of four and liked the separation of the room from the living room to the bedroom. The bathroom was just gorgeous. We normally stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village a few times a year. The grounds and beachfront, outdoor pools are larger, which would make it a better stay for families with children. Everything else other than that makes the Hokulani a step above. The boutique feel with amazing service where they get to know their guests is appreciated. The location with many restaurants and shops step away make this property a premier stay.Thank you to the staff at Hokulani.

Thus this review is written not knowing the true cost of the room. Generally my reviews are based on value. So I would expect more from a place that charges more and that perceived value is reflected in my reviews.The facility was nice. You take an escalator from the street which leads you into the lobby. They have Bell Service at the street level to help you with your bags.Parking is valet only and expensive even by Honolulu standards. I believe I was quoted $40 per night. I found somewhere else to park. Check-in was quick, smooth and efficient. Staff was polite and helpful.The elevators I have a level of security I have not seen before. You scan your room card, there is a display asking you which floor wish to go to. After you have entered the floor number the display tells you which elevator to get in. Once inside, there are no buttons. The elevator takes you to your desired floor and you have no other choice. However, once inside the hotel you can move freely between floors without a security card. Just enter the desired floor on the console and it will indicate which elevator to take.The rooms were spacious. I stayed in a corner room on a low floor. Windows were large. There was a small lanai. A small amount of road noise could be heard due to the low floor, and above you could occasionally hear footsteps. But overall relatively quiet. There is a living room / kitchenette. The kitchenette had a built-in two-burner hot plate, hotel size refrigerator, and a separate reasonably sized freezer. The sink included a garbage disposal and there was a small dishwasher. There were cabinets with cookware and dishes. Additionally there was a toaster, blender, rice cooker and coffee maker. Complimentary coffee was Hawaiian Paradise brand (claims to be 100% Ka'u coffee). Additionally there was a small couch which could pull out into a bed, a coffee table, a small dining room table with two chairs and an entertainment / storage console. There was a large flat screen TV mounted in the living room (another mounted in the bedroom, and another built into the mirror of the bathroom) complete with a PlayStation/DVD player. DVD movies could be checked out from a Redbox type of machine with a card provided at check-in. The floors were nice Hardwood covered by an area rug.The bedroom was also large. Queen with a queen size bed standard in tables, lamps, telephone and a smaller TV mounted to the wall. There was a small dresser.The bathroom was quite large with two closets, very large mirror, lots of counter space, dual sinks, separate stand-alone tub, glass shower enclosure and large enclosed toilet area with the heated seat and Toto Washlet. The bathtub is somewhat unique as it fills from the ceiling. Amenities were standard hotel type amenities. Above-average for quality (Peter Thomas Roth).The entire room had lots of natural light. Overall quite comfortable.Several floors have complimentary laundry, the machines appeared to be of good quality and in working order. There was a small gym on the floor I stayed on. It had treadmills and free weights.A highlight of this facility was the rooftop lounge. There is a lap pool (only 3 feet 0.9 meters deep), small hot tub, moderate sized deck, several covered Cabanas with tables, couch and TV period a small snack shop / bar. On Monday nights they offer movie night with free pupus (I did not indulge, so I cannot comment). But the highlight is the view. There is an excellent view overlooking Waikiki with nice views of the ocean. A very nice place to relax.Overall, a nice, comfortable property in a very desirable part of Waikiki. The rooms are set up well and the property contains amenities to make this an excellent place to stay both for the short and long-term.I attached some pictures from the rooftop lounge.",Honolulu,"Maikai_hoaloha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",57,4.0

Hilton has renovated the property into sleek and contemporary residences. These reviews were helpful in locating the entrance to the hotel since it is tucked inside the Beachwalk Strip. There is a valet on street level (which is for loading and unloading only) on Lewers Ave. not on Kalakaua and you take the escalator up to check in. The rooms are nice and perfectly sized for a property in the city. The ceilings are NOT low, as indicated in an earlier review. I realize that review was posted 3 years ago, but I seriously doubt they’ve raised the ceilings since then. That said, if you are a very tall person (6’4”+), the shower may seem low. Nice TVs in both living area and bedroom. The bed is really comfortable, the bathroom is huge. The ToTo Toilet with washlet is a plus. The rooms are nicely appointed and clean. The kitchen is more of an area than a room, but we’re on vacation, so a refrigerator and coffee maker are all we require. A note to those people who complain about the size: this is a city property. Just a teeny bit of research would tell you that the property consists of only one bedroom units, which should indicate that this not a family resort. If you have procreated sufficiently that you have outgrown a one bedroom unit, might I suggest Hilton Hawaiian Village or Disney Aulani? I say this to get laughs but if you do have children 6 to 13, your kids would be happier (and therefore you would be happier) at HHV. As another reviewer mentioned, staying at Hokulani does not allow you pool privilege at HHV. The staff at reception, the cleaning staff and the valet crew were all very friendly and helpful. The valet was most accommodating, as was reception (I frequently needed more coffee, which they happily provided). This is a valet only parking property, which carries an additional daily fee for parking if you have a car.  We are HGVC members and, as such, have stayed at a number of Hilton properties. We would recommend this property to vacationers who are adults with no more than one child or 2 very young children and who are not looking to cook their own meals. With so many dining options available within walking distance, just enjoy! Suggestions for improvement: add a disinfecting cleaner in the gym. We bought our own, but it is good practice to have a cleaner in a gym. The lobby has a fantastic sitting area off to the side of reception, but it is not used much. A nice little wine bar at night would be a way to make good use of this space and give guests a place to unwind at the end of the day.

Immediately outside are dozens of places to eat. There are non-stop places on the second floor to the end of the next block. In addition, the restaurants are somewhat inexpensive, if you get there for happy hour. There is a good hamberger place next door, and a Japanese restaurant nearby.

At first, this seemed weird, but now we understand it's a safety feature that keeps visitors from meandering along floors where they have no business meandering.  My only beef is with the so-called ""resort fee.""On top of our $400 per night charge, it seemed rather absurd to pay an extra $30 per night in ""resort fees,"" which gave us—woohoo!!!— 2 bottles of water per day, and that was it. We didn't even lay eyes on the rooftop pool, and if there were other ""resort amenities"" available that we could have used, I have no idea what they were.This is a downtown hotel, and a very nice one, but it's not on the beach. You can't see the ocean even from the 8th floor. It looks down on a super-busy street and the roof of a shopping mall. In no way that I can see is it a ""resort"" worth tacking $90 onto a $1200 bill.  Four-and-a-half stars.

The room is great for long term stays because you do really feel at home and all the amenities are provided including four beach towels each day.

Another positive is that there are free laundry facilities on each floor and this makes life so easy! A definite plus. The negatives are that this hotel charges a resort fee when (in my view) it should not. This hotel is not a resort, there is one small pool on the top floor and that’s about it. I really thought it was a bit exorbitant for Hilton to charge a resort fee for this hotel type. There is one bar but I never saw anyone there and could probably be a better use for that space.Also, there are no views per se.

The A/C and lighting were perfect. Just off the sitting and bedroom were sliding glass doors to the balcony overlooking the Lewers Street beachwalk.Along the beachwalk are scores of high and low-end restaurants and shops and across the street is the Royal Hawaiian Center with shopping and parking. Sheraton's Alioha Landing is there also, where many tour buses pick up their passengers. Try to go see the Magic of Polynesia show at the Holiday Inn Beachcomber just down Kalakaua a couple of blocks.

HGVC properties are always great, but this one was particularly fantastic. The location is perfect. I'd been a bit disappointed when I booked, to not get a beachfront hotel, but it didn't matter one bit. The Hokulani is so centrally located to shops, restaurants, the beach, and the Sheraton's bus depot (where many tour companies pick up), I honestly found it better than a beachfront resort. The room was very comfortable; my husband and I were in a one bedroom suite and it was plenty of room. Small touches like the alarm clock nightlight that comes on for just enough time to get situated in bed were delightful; I really enjoyed the bathroom mirror lights; the rain shower and standalone tub were both great. Having the kitchen was a great way for us to save a little money by making breakfast in the mornings. The staff was all SO friendly and helpful, they greeted us with leis when we arrived and always said aloha and went out of their way to grab your towels (and get you fresh ones) when you returned from the beach. We spent less time at the rooftop pool than I thought we would; it was lovely but only 3 feet deep and we just ended up wanting to be at the beach. The DVDnow system was so nice to have free, current movie rentals in the evenings.The only ""negatives,"" if I can even call them that, would be that the laundry area is common (usually at HGVC it's in the room) - but this really didn't matter to me much - and that the coffee pot is some proprietary pod system, and when you've used the two pods they give you, you have to pay to get more. That seemed a little silly for us being there a week, but if that's the ""worst"" of it, I'll take it :)We will definitely return to the Hokulani!!","Corona, California","Alyse F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corona, California</strong>",11,5.0

Rooms we spacious and had kitchenette facilities so that we could have a break from constant takeaway for breakfast/lunch/dinner.Our room was clean and we were very happy with it. Unfortunately we had the view that consisted largely of concrete from the building next door however we had a nice view of the ocean when we sat on the lounge.The bathroom is HUGE and has a TV in the mirror while unnecessary that was pretty cool. I loved having so much space and dual sinks.The bed was super comfortable and I slept very well here with minimal noise from other guests.The pool area is pretty however the pool itself is a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures. Almost pointless although I suppose it's a good area to dip and cool down. Still, it's lucky the hotel is only a few minutes walk to the beach. On our first night, and on at least one other occasion throughout our stay, the pool area was closed for a private function. I was really disappointed by this as it would have been refreshing after a long flight.We also found that the pool bar and the restaurant downstairs were often closed and the hours were very restricted on days of opening. There was no actual food available at the pool. When looking to order from the restaurant we found we didn't even have the ability to charge back to our room.When we first arrived, we spoke to one of the concierge staff who was extremely unhelpful. We mentioned that and a few little problems with our room (including the tap not functioning correctly and the ice machine not working) and the hotel manager kindly credited $50 to our room, a gesture that we did appreciate.Unfortunately our experiences with concierge staff did not improve, I found I ended up having to research online and book my own tours without any advice/local knowledge that I would expect.We got our welcome lei and tote the day after we arrived, not quite the same.Given the lack of features of the hotel and the lack of knowledge and attitude of staff, I really resented having to pay for the resort fee. Essentially feels like we got 2 really expensive bottles of water every day. This hotel while nice, is NOT a resort and in my opinion cannot justify the price it is charging for this.This hotel really does have the potential to bump up to a review of 5 with a few adjustments.","Canberra, Australia","KatL700</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",31,3.0

I come to Oahu every two years for work and have previously stayed at doubletree and embassy suites, both good properties. The Hokulani as a grand vacation property is very much like an upscale residential building. I found it to be significantly quieter than tradition hotel properties with lots of nice little amenities such as washer dryer on every floor; much upgraded bathrooms with double sink, oversized shower with mural, large separate soaking tub and TV embedded in the bathroom mirror. I stayed in room 1101. Let me say here this property is not ocean front and is somewhat back from the beach. 1101 - and I assume all higher 01 tier units - had a very good view of the ocean (not too distant) as well as the fireworks from the Hawaiian village on the weekend. The view for the other units on this side of the building will be partially or fully blocked by a large building next door to this one. What I most enjoyed about the Hokulani was the fact the suites have very close to a full kitchen. I was able to make eggs on the stove top and there was a small fridge, a freezer and dishwasher. All Dishes and pots and pans are provided.Internet speed was blazing fast (I was able to download movies) and free for diamond members. I found the bed to be very comfortable. The A/C worked great and I could make the room very cold if I desired (which I did not). The shower had one of those rainfall shower heads which I often find to be very weak but this one had good water pressure.The employees were amazing - always consistently friendly (calling me by name) and knowledgeable. The valet folks were insanely fast-the car was always waiting for me by the time I got to the lobby. Roderick in valet stands out. I would often be getting my car at 2 am and had no wait. I spoke with many of the front desk folks and they too were consistently friendly and knowledgeable.Two things - other reviewers are right about the beautiful roof deck and lounge but the pool is no more than a lap pool which was fine with me. The other - be aware the hotel does not serve breakfast but that was also expected as most grand vacation properties do not. I cooked my breakfast in the suite kitchen; there is a 24 hour denny's one block away. Neither of these was a problem for me.That's my take-hope its helpful. Thanks for the great stay. This is definitely my new accommodation when I am in Oahu.Oh, valet parking is 38 per day in and out and you can call the valet from your room to have the car waiting for you.",,Stephen F,29,5.0

The room was upgraded nicely and the only complaint I had with the room is that it was an alley view. In fact, I think it would've been difficult to get a much worse view. The hotel does attempt to get you to stop by and discuss the possibility of a timeshare tour at one of their other properties, but it isn't hard-sell. Also, since it's a timeshare property, you don't have daily service (although I think we got it every day as far as I could tell.) The pool is on the rooftop and is tiny. The view is nice, however, and it was never really crowded. I kind of liked it up there. Just don't expect something kid friendly and inviting. There wasn't always someone on bar duty up there either, so you were sort of on your own for drinks later in the afternoon. Parking your car costs a small fortune, but service at the hotel was excellent. Having stayed at most of the Hilton properties in Waikiki, I'd probably avoid this hotel in the future. You can, in general, stay less expensively elsewhere and the timeshare component of this hotel is more of a nuisance than an advantage.","Livermore, California","Anonymous925</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Livermore, California</strong>",53,4.0

Hokulani did not disappoint us. It is a smaller of Hilton (Grand Vacation Club) property (compare to Hilton Hawaiian Village a couple of miles away) and has smaller swimming pool and onsite restaurants but tht is very well compensated by its location.In walking distance, so many things to do specially you like to walk The staff is very helpful and polite, Swimming pool on the top deck is very nice, quiet and scenic (we just lay in water and not serous swimmers) . It is a sort of narrow pool but just right for us. If you are driving, a couple of things: There is only Valet on site parking and might be considered expensive at $37/day buy there is no other nearby place to park. We did not mind this. Secondly, again if you are driving, their valet station is pretty much on a busy street where you drop the car. It is a bit concerning from safety perspective.

As HGVC members, we prefer this property to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It seems more geared to couples, though we did see some smaller families as well.The rooms are decorated with a contemporary vibe and are well appointed. We stayed in a one bedroom plus and loved the double entrance to the large bathroom. The shower has a rain shower fixture which may not be for everyone, but there is also a separate hand held shower head you can use also. The Toto washlet has convinced us we need a Japanese toilet and will get one during our next remodel!Staff is super friendly and location is convenient. Parking is valet only, I think.

Location is terrific, step out of the foyer and you are on Beach Walk surrounded by shopping and eating options, and not too far from the beach. Our first five nights were in a room on the ninth floor looking towards Honolulu, with the second five nights in a higher apartment with a view of the Royal Hawaiian and ocean. Both rooms were corner suites, very clean and a good size for a couple with large bathroom and good size living and sleeping areas. Kitchen a bonus too. Both rooms had plusses. Apartment looking towards Honolulu a little quieter re road noise, while room facing the beach had a fantastic view. While we felt that the apartments appealed to those travelling without children, we did notice a few families with young ones. The rooftop bar/pool was a great spot to rest after being out and about. The pool is really just for cooling off, not resort style. One of the best parts of our stay was the staff. From our initial booking request, to Housekeeping, Concierge and Reception. No request was too much and all were fantastic. A special shout out goes to Blane - the Front Office Manager, Marin and Susan on Reception, Conrad on the Concierge and Arnel running the bar.

As HGVC owners we were so impressed. It's right in the heart of Waikiki easy walking to many restaurants and shops. Quick walk to the beach but we actually preferred the excellent roof top pool, hot tub and even cabanas! And did I mention a full service bar? The best part was that all during our stay we had this space virtually to ourselves. The rooms are decent size, not huge, but nice size living room, bedroom and huge bathroom with an awesome waterfall shower separate tub and dual sinks. Kitchen area was small but very functional. I'd say the design is best suited for couples or +1 vs large families but it was plenty of space for us - and elegantly designed and furnished. Note Washer dryer on each floor vs in room. Nice thing is they are full size vs apt size as in most places.The best part(and something we've come to expect at HGVC properties) was the staff. They couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. Especially on our last day agreed to give us a little extra time to check out and multiple options to store our luggage. Valet parking is required due to location of hotel but it's actually a positive. Not a lot of places to easily park in Waikiki. And these guys had the car sitting there by the time we stepped off the elevator EVERY time! People who are not only good at their jobs but actually want to make sure your visit to paradise is perfect.

There are also cabanas hooked up with tv's, so you can have some shade when it gets too hot on the roof top. The valet is expensive, $39 a day, I believe. However, you do get in and out privileges, and the guys at valet are super nice and helpful. Overall, it's a great hotel for couples, young and young at heart. For families, I would suggest the Hilton Hawaiian Village. If given the opportunity to stay here again, I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.","Oakville, Canada","worldtravelerca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakville, Canada</strong>",33,4.0

We were told it used to be an Outrigger hotel and that each unit used to be two hotel rooms. We had a one bedroom Plus unit which was nicely decorated but still felt cramped for just two people. The mattress was too soft for my liking and gave me a backache so I didn't sleep well.There is a small kitchenette and a large bathroom. Our room, 511, was quiet which we preferred. From the balcony (only deep enough to stand, not sit), we could see the 75th Pearl Harbor Anniversary parade. That was an unexpected plus.However, unlike most timeshares, this one wasn't really suited for resort type relaxation. It is located in the middle of the Waikiki shopping and restaurant area. The beach is a short walk away. The rooftop pool is so small that it's basically for sitting in and cooling off. You can't swim laps even if you wanted to.

Hotel personnel provide great service. Very secure, you need key to access the elevators to go up, but no key is required to go to the lobby or basement garage. If you can manage your luggage, I suggest you park (valet only) in the basement garage and carry you own luggage to the lobby (via elevator). Entrance is on Kalakaua.Each floor has 2 free washers and 2 dryers. There is also a trash chute in the laundry room. Under the kitchen sink there is a small (single washload) package of laundry soap, but you can request additional packages. Room has 2 closets, so lots of hanging space. One closet in the bedroom and one in the living room. There is also an ironing board, iron, plastic laundry basket and a dust pan and broom in the closest.There is a dresser in the bedroom, but there are also 2 drawers in the living where the TV is located. These drawers are a little tricky to open, the ""handle"" is on the ends of the drawer. The bedroom dresser also has a safe in 1 bottom drawer. A TV in the bedroom and another in the living room. Also a DVD player and video game unit in the living room, free wifi. Sliding doors thru-out.Kitchen is compact, with all the items you would need to prepare simple meals. There is a blender, toaster, rice cooker, etc. Paper towels are also on the counter. There is Tassimo coffee unit with coffee accessories. The refrigerator is built in under the counter (larger than a dorm room frig). The freezer is also built in with an automatic ice maker. There is no ice maker on the floors. Kitchen has an electric range and microwave oven.Bathroom is very spacious with lots of counter space and 2 sinks. Toilet room has a separate door and is equipped with a Japanese electronic seat with water controls, etc. Shower (rain) type is very large with a separate shower wand attachment. I couldn't figure how to turn the wand off, but if you turn off the water and turn it back on, the wand goes off and normal shower resumes. The bath tub is large, and as others have mentioned the water comes out of the ceiling.Rooftop plunge pool is suited just for sitting and relaxing, maybe with a drink. You really can't swim in it. There are 6 cabanas each with a large TV, sofa, 2 chairs and a round table. Canvas top provides shade, but if it is somewhat raining, you will get wet.Hotel lobby is roomy enough. Restrooms are behind the front desk glass wall. Note that the front desk has a luggage scale. The business center is off in a side room where they also have a DVD rental machine.

I am typically a stickler about hotel cleanliness so I was pleasantly surprised by how well kept the hotel and rooms were. We stayed in the one bedroom with our kids on the pullout couch. They did say that it was uncomfortable and I can attest to feeling the springs (so probably only have kids sleep on it). Room service was done once during our 5 day stay which would have been fine but they only gave us 4 bathroom towels for the 4 of us. I even requested more from the maid when she cleaned it and left her a tip and she still only replaced the 4. The rooftop pool is also a bit of a joke. It is more like 3ft of water to cool you off. Because of this, we spent all of the days over at Hawaiian Village where our friends were staying and used their pool. In short, if you want a pool do not stay here.

The apartment was quite chic and useful, clearly adapted for Japanese tastes. The refrigerator and dishwasher are small, but sufficed for our needs,and there were adequate dishes, pots and pans and a rice cooker and blender. Sheets and towels were changed once only, the third day and at that time amenities were replenished. I found the bathroom amenities quite substandard, not the level I would expect. One of the faucets leaked around the base and we were told it could NOT be fixed and we would have to wrap a towel around it for our entire visit. Our room looked out onto a wall and the balcony was tiny. No point in sitting out on it anyway as there was nothing to see but that huge wall. Service for the most part was excellent with a couple of quite glaring exceptions. The first was that my guest checked in before I did so when I the owner arrived I was not offered any information, lei, or anything but a room key. The second was upon check out when I told the desk person and the bell hop that I would be waiting in the lobby for Speedi Shuttle, but after an hour nobody came for me.Nobody checked on me either.I went down to the bell hop and he told me the shuttle driver had gone upstairs to look for me. i knew this was not possible as I was waiting right at the top of the escalator. To their credit, the hotel provided me with Charley's Taxi and when I returned the service from which I booked Speedi Shuttle investigated the GPS and discovered Speedi lied about picking me up and had never arrived at all, so my money for that was refunded. The other whine is that the rooftop cabanas were closed for an entire afternoon for ""cleaning"" which posed problems for us as my entire family was visiting us. I thought these cabanas were to be cleaned at night when guests were not using them. On the other hand, the hotel did have the fairly standard cocktail reception- with no cocktails just nice wraps and snacks as it couldn't be held on the roof, a bingo game, and that was fairly fun. One nice thing is that when the hallway was smelling a whole lot from garlic, shrimp and other cooking, housekeeping sprayed a very pleasant coconut spray that eliminated the malevolent odors and was also, amazingly, very nice. It smelled like summer! I also really liked the laundry facilities! The rooms are small and clearly the resort is NOT for children. It is not very near the beach, is surrounded by high level shopping and restaurants, and lots of traffic. That is not a criticism on my part, as I knew that when I went there and that is what I wanted anyway.","Reno, Nevada","Jildatheonly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",17,4.0

The bathroom in the unit is larger than the bedroom and as large as the living room that included a small L shape kitchenette, very strange.

After spending two weeks at various other hotels on the big island and Oahu, this was a quiet and luxurious change. The hotel is ideally suited to couples and is located on the corner of the two main streets in the Waikiki area, Kalakaua Ave with its high end boutiques, restaurants and beach front hotels and Lewers St with more restaurants and beach walk shops. 2 minutes walk to the beach (max) and an ABC store directly underneath the hotel.This is not a beach side hotel and the view is (mostly) of the surrounding Waikiki area not of the ocean. This was not a consideration for us but if a great view or being on the beach is your thing, the Hokulani isnt your place. I do think however that the benefits of this hotel far outweigh its non beach location and compared to the beach side hotels and the space you would get, this is by far better value for money.The rooms were large and well laid out. The bathrooms were massive (TV in the mirror!) the small kitchen was well equipped. This is a condo hotel so dont expect a mini bar or room service but considering you can buy what ever you desire downstairs, this is not missed. The highlight for us was the roof top pool and cabanas. The pool is small but perfect if you just want to just relax and cool down. Little kids would love it but older kids would probably be bored.The cabanas are free on a first come first served basis and include a large day bed, chairs and a table, TV, Fridge and safe. We spent many an afternoon lazing in the sun, drink in hand admiring the view. If you dont get a cabana or want to sit in the sun, there are plenty of other options including loungers and sofa seating. The poolside bar is only open for a few hours a day and offers limited options but is fine for a cold drink. BYO lunch from ABC is a cheap and easy alternative to eating out everyday.We spent time up there almost every day and there was never more than a handful of people up there at any time.The staff were super friendly and helpful. We had an issue with a running toilet and they came up straight away to fix it. We booked with points rented from a HGVC member that we found on-line so got a great rate.

First off, we arrived early at the front desk and the friendly staff allowed us an early check-in, which was really appreciated. Our unit was high in the floor and I enjoyed every detail of it. It is compact, urban-style and no space is wasted with a modern touch everywhere. The bathroom was gigantic with a built-in TV screen in the large mirror above the sinks. The shower was awesome! Location-location-location is a must for the Hokulani which is in the heart of the bustling Waikiki. The largest ABC store in Honolulu is just down the street and the Yard House is within the same block with my favorite draft beers and vegan dishes. A couple of really nice galleries and other boutiques compliment the area. The beach is also 5 minutes walk and you'll find other great places to go out at night around the corner. There is a pool on the roof top, which was big enough to get wet but I think the view, comfortable lounge chairs, the bar and the hot tub are more of interest. The checkout process was also very smooth, though, I am not really fund of the Hawaiian state tax! It was very easy to be picked up by our shuttle right in front and go back to the airport.

If you're traveling with small children and/or lots of luggage, bear this in mind. After you take the escalator up, you enter the lobby and go down two or three steps; there is a handicapped ramp, but it isn't conspicuous.That aside, checkin was pretty quick and easy. Front desk staff are friendly. Security is fairly tight: the elevators require you to scan your room key and enter your destination floor. It's a little strange, but you get used to not pushing any buttons once you get into the elevator, and the elevators are relatively quick.We had room 503, a 1BR. It has a two-burner cooktop, plus refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. The furnishings are pretty new and modern, and the Japanese influence seems to be strong -- lots of sliding panels and various ways of maximizing a small space.The bed is comfortable, and the room is quiet. It has no view to speak of, but that is actually an advantage in terms of quiet, because Waikiki is a hopping place.The bathroom has a shower stall and bathtub, but prepare yourself for a shock, because the water for the bathtub comes out of a hole in the ceiling. My wife got a big surprise the first time she ran a bath.We didn't really use many of the amenities, aside from the business center and the rooftop pool and bar. The pool is ridiculously small -- I could almost touch both sides by stretching my arms out. There is also relatively little shade on the roof; there are umbrellas, but the staff cautioned me that the wind can kick up suddenly, which means placing them near the edge can be risky.The bar was pleasant, though you have to specify a call brand. I ordered a gin and tonic without specifying, and what I got wasn't very good. Arnel, one of the bartenders, was very pleasant, and was a fount of information on what to do and where to go in Waikiki and other places on the island.If you have a car, it's going to be expensive to park. Valet parking is your only choice at the property, and that's $35 per day. For that you get the convenience of being able to call downstairs and have your car brought out whenever you need it.Bottom line: it's a great location, and the property is very clean and in good condition, with friendly and helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again.","Fort Myers Beach, Florida","singflysmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Myers Beach, Florida</strong>",164,5.0

This is the newest addition to the collection of Hilton Towers in Waikiki. It’s on one of the most convenient streets on the west end of Waikiki. Coffee shops, pubs, restaurants, shopping areas, and the beach are but a few steps away from the hotel. Hokulani enjoys the best location of all the company's properties in Waikiki. Friendly staff. Concierge is very engaging, knowledgeable, and eager to help. We certainly appreciated the secure elevator system, a free state-of-the-art laundry room on every floor, the well-equipped fitness center, the rooftop sunning deck and spa with a bar, and all the other resort amenities. We enjoyed our suite on the 12th floor that had a commanding view of Kalakaua Blvd in the heart of Waikiki. Sandy beaches are a few blocks’s walk away…that is, if you don’t get sidetracked by the surrounding shops, restaurants, bars, and such. Stay focused and enjoy your stay in Waikiki. The resort offers valet parking at a cost. But are several several alternative parking lots and garages nearby for a reasonable price. Highly recommended. I’ve stayed in many of the hotels in Waikiki over the years and this is clearly the best for the money.","Danville, California","BryanReese</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Danville, California</strong>",107,4.0

You will be charged a $30.00 per day fee RESORT FEE which is a cunning way of adding an unwarranted fee to your room. As an honor member this is an insult as they charge you for unlimited internet and water, things which are included in your Honors membership. The hotel is equipped with a 3M deep pool on the roof, a small exercise room, no parking other than valet and no where to off load your baggage if you are parking elsewhere. Valet parking is $32 per day. There is a snack bar in the lobby with a concentration on Japanese cuisine. Several restaurants are located on the block with the best value being the ABC store next to Denny's as a strip steak, potatoes and a vegetable is 10.00, This proves to be the best option for most travelers and is a mere 3 minute walk.The rooms are very nice and the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.

I believe this facility opened January 2014. The parking lot is hard to find, I knew about it from reading someone's review. We arrived from another island early, but wasn't allowed to check in until 4pm, yet our bags and groceries were taken to our room 2 hours earlier. This 1 bedroom unit is small compared to its sister site at Hilton Hawaiian village on Oahu. The ceilings are low: I am 5'4"" tall and I could touch the ceiling! Refrigerator too small, not full size as in their other properties. I accidentally spilled my water upon arrival on the wood floors, used paper towel to dry it up. I was thoroughly disgusted when I saw the filth on the paper towel! I thought, We waited for almost 4 hours for them to clean the room and it is apparent that housekeeping hadn't used a wet mop with soap and water on that floor probably since they opened! I wanted to go out and sit on the balcony....what balcony, my hubby and I could stand out there and that was about it, we couldn't hear each other talk, and we had a view of the stucco of the building next door. Believe me, we did hear the delivery trucks and the garbage pick up, and the men on these trucks yelling at each other! The ice machine in the freezer drawer didn't work so they had to bring us bags of ice ( and this place wasn't a year old yet! What about warranties on equipment). The best part of the room was the Bidet toilet! Seriously, they shoved too many rooms into this building. Our 1 bedroom was the size of a studio. And that small little pool, what a waste! I have been a HGVG timeshare owner for 14 years and have never been this dissatisfiedWith a facility, especially a new facility. I know I will never stay here again! It seems like they cater to the.

I've also been to Honolulu many times before. After researching this property (we had purchased a 7-nt stay during a HGV tour) and seeing the exterior picture I was quite frankly worried but as soon as I saw the lobby I have to say it was all uphill. I loved this property and quite frankly would consider staying there as my top choice when back in Honolulu. Yes, the pool is not spectacular and its a few blocks to the beach but the room and staff more than made up for these shortcomings. The valet parking staff was always helpful & excellent customer service. While no one likes to pay $35/night to park I have to say in the end it was a bargain due to convenience. The front desk crew also deserves a call out as they were always eager to help and go beyond what I've experienced at other properties.What impressed us was the quality of the room's furnishings and size. Perfect for 2 and not a bother if your party is 4. This is one of the few places I've stayed that felt as if the designer actually understood the customer. Kitchenette was super convenient and efficient. The laundry facility on each floor was a big bonus.The walk to the beach--was again not the bother I'd stressed about prior to our arrival. It was very easy walk and with the ABC stores nearby every little need was within arm's reach. All the restaurants and shopping were equally easy and another surprise upon arrival.

There is cleaning once every 4 days, but shampoo, soap, conditioner, lotion, fresh towels are available if you ask. Before staying here, you need to be okay with this. Stayed 12 nights here and loved the location and the amenities in the room. The staff was so helpful and friendly. By the second day they knew me by name and when they did not see me for 2 days, they were concerned enough to see if I was okay (unfortunately had food poisoning). Cleaning personnel asked us each day in the hall if we needed anything.As others have mentioned this is more of a boutique timeshare than one such as the Hilton Hawaiian Village timeshares. There are only 1 bedroom suites. At first, I expected to have 2 friends join me, but was glad that only one decided to come with me. There were 2 beds in the bedroom as I had requested, but it would have been tight in space to have another adult on the sofa bed. It would take most of the space in the living room to open it and 3 using the bathroom would have required much more time to get ready in the mornings. The kitchen was also small with a microwave, 2 burners, ice machine (when it worked), very small refrigerator, toaster, rice maker, plates, silverware, dishwasher, and knife block. Since we did not plan to make meals it worked fine for us. The living room had a sofa, small table with 2 chairs, and a tv. Under the tv was a storage area that could be used for clothes. There was a closet with hangers. In the bedroom was a chest with 6 drawers. One of the drawers contained the safe. There was a closet in the bedroom with hangers. We were able to store our suitcases in the 2 closets.We were on the 10th floor and had a partial view of the ocean. The lanai was very small - no chairs on it so we did not use it.Since others have commented on the bathroom I will not review it except to say it is a very nice bathroom and I really liked the shower. The location is why I stayed here. So close to the trolley stops, restaurants, stores, and the beach. The ABC store is right next to the hotel on the lower level. It was handy to buy water, soda, and snacks and not have to carry them very far. It's surprising how much water weighs when you buy the larger containers and have to carry them for any distance.It's too bad that the small cafe closed inside the hotel. Would have been nice to be able to have a pastry in the morning there, but there are so many places very close that it was not that difficult to go out for breakfast. The Cheeseburger place had a breakfast special for $5.99 and many places within walking distance had breakfast for $3.99 and $4.99.My major disappointment was the pool. It really cannot be called a pool. It is very narrow and only 3 foot deep. It is split in the middle so you could not even swim a lap. It is fine for cooling off while sunning. We really enjoyed the pool area, especially the cabanas. We were able to use one every day. They had a couch, table and two chairs, a refrigerator, and tv. I was glad that no one used the tv's since that would have spoiled the atmosphere of the area. Hawaiian music was played. Water was available at the bar. On the days that the bar was open, prices were reasonable at $2 per coke and $9 per tropical drink. Happy Hour prices were about $7. Another positive was that the pool area was never crowded since only guests were able to access it. Security is very good with only those with a room key were able to use the elevators. Plus since the staff knew everyone, it would be difficult for anyone else to access the property.Would I stay here again? If an agreement was reached with the HHV to use their pools, I would definitely stay here again (there is such an agreement on the Big Island where people staying at Kingsland can use the pool at the Hilton Hotel). I really liked the staff so much more than at the HHV timeshares. They are much more customer service oriented. So for a trip where I want a nice pool and grounds - more of a resort, then this is not the place. Where I want convenience and customer service then this is a good match.","Rock Island, IL","JLC_57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rock Island, IL</strong>",106,4.0

East Asian orientation of hotel staff highly inhibits the spirit of aloha.Very clean and modern hotel. Yes a 4 or maybe even 4 1/2 star property overall. This review will focus mainly on shortcomings and areas for potential improvement. Parking is pricey at ~$35/day valet, with no self-parking option. (I did not rent and park a car here for that reason, so I cannot comment on the valet service.) The property is in a location that is difficult to beat in terms of access to shopping and dining, but the views are lacking apart from a magnificent view down the length of Kalakaua Ave from the rooftop hot tub. The location is about a 5-10 minute walk from Waikiki Beach (accessible via the Sheraton or Royal Hawaiian hotels.) This is not a hotel that is meant to appeal to children, which worked wonderfully for me as it was just my wife and I visiting. For instance, the rooftop pool is 3 ft deep X 5 ft wide by 30 ft (my best-guess approximation) so it's not really a ""play pool"" shape or size. The rooms are large, modern, and of a high standard overall, including the kitchen and bathroom kit. The bath amenities were of a decent quality but very low quantity, especially considering that you must go out of your way to request additional soap, shampoo, etc directly from the staff. When did shampoo become such a pricey commodity that they can't give you a few ounces? The Gevalia coffee pod machine produced horrible, weak, American muddy water diner coffee that was not nearly strong or tasty enough for my liking, and I'm not really a coffee snob. The in-room safes accommodate a laptop and little more as they are shallow. My wife's purse is only a few inches thick and the safe's lid would barely shut.The staff are polite and courteous, yet a bit cold, especially by Hawaiian standards. They need to hire more locals and demonstrate some real aloha spirit rather than the generic form of hospitality one could expect to find in any hotel of this standard. I made few requests which were mostly dealt with efficiently, though my check-in experience was akin to dealing with a robot regurgitating information and would not truly hear my request. Again, more of a local touch would be sufficient to right this issue. To be fair, the vast majority of the clientele are Japanese so understandably the staff need to be bilingual/bi-cultural.To summarize, a great property overall and you will enjoy your stay as long as you book with an awareness of the above limitations affecting your stay.","Laguna Beach, California","Mondonaut</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Beach, California</strong>",10,4.0

We booked a 1 bedroom suite---meant to accommodate 4 adults. Here are our pros and cons:1. Room was simply too small and cramped for us. We were given a corner suite, but it was not very big. No place to really put out our suitcases. Kitchen was small--and, once you actually added food to the counter space, it became very close! We were always bumping into each other. Or, sitting on the floor as the sitting space became housing for suitcases and beach equipment.2. You had to access the bathroom through the master bedroom. Ok during the day, but difficult to walk through a quiet bedroom at night.3. The shower was really lovely. Rain shower and wand. But, unfortunately, it smelled of mildew Perhaps poor drainage.4. Bathtub, with water falling from above, was awesome. Very fun and novel.5. Separate toilet within the bathroom area. Nice.6. Poor view. We looked at a building and the road...we weren't expecting an ocean view, but our view tended to be a bit noisy and dull.7. Rooftop pool was great. Wonderful view. Nice hot tub. Good loungers. Plunge pool was fine for our child---and the other children that we saw using it.8. Elevator system was confusing at first, but once we got used to it, it worked well.9. Great location! Easy to get around on foot! Good bus access from Kuhio.10. Staff was pleasant and personable.11. The hot water tap in the kitchen made noise all night. Creaking and tapping.

When the cab driver and the bellman were loading our luggage into the taxi, their heavy swinging/packing broke a piece off of our suitcase!!!! We were NOT happy! And, both laughed about it! No apology! Not a pleasant way to end our stay at the Hokulani. Overall, the hotel was decent. We will probably not stay here again. It may be better for a different traveller.We decided, though, to cut our stay at Hokulani and to head back to the HHV.

We had no intention of cooking in the hotel more grabbing a quick breakfast before heading out for the day. It was the Christmas holiday period so you expect it to be a bit pricey but it was pretty steep at over $500 a night, but the hotel is in a great location, plenty of restaurants nearby and a few minutes walk to the beach. We asked to be moved to a higher floor on day 2 as our view was rubbish, they took care of it straight away, floor 8 was a lot better. Clean and new accommodation with a separate living space with a sofa bed for our teenage son, and a playstation. He loved it. View from the pool area on the roof is fantastic, there was always an available sun lounger and the pool is just for a dip, not a swim - the cabanas are first come first serve and they are perfect for a snooze, they even have a flat screen tv and fridge.

I was really wanting to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, however, there was no availability. I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this property. As a brand new hotel, it was up-to-date with all modern technology and amenities, including elevators controlled by room key cards and a tv in bathroom mirror. The location was totally convenient, just off the main drag of Kalakaua. Tons of bars, restaurants and shopping are steps away and the beach was about two blocks away. The room I stayed in was a double suite. It was spacious enough for two people, but a third may fit comfortably as the couch turns into a bed. In addition to the aforementioned tv in the bathroom mirror, there was a 42-inch screen in the bedroom and another in the living room as well. The sliding door was practically an entire wall, which was nice allowing the ocean breeze in the room. Although small, the refrigerator and freezer held enough food for the week in an otherwise fully supplied kitchen. We rented a car from the airport (Hertz allowed in-town returns at no charge) and stopped at a Safeway (Kroger/Von's) to pick up drinks and snacks. There was not a washing and drying machine in the room, but each floor has two each that are free to use; the downside was the night before checkout all were in use; we had to go up a few floors before we were able to find vacant machines. The wood floors and bright light throughout were a nice change from carpeted and dimly lit rooms from a traditional hotel. The pool is on the roof and is a joke. I was told it's not a swimming pool, but rather a dipping pool. There's a hot tub too, which was equally small. The coolest thing about the roof were the free cabanas (first come first served) which feature comfortable chairs and couches and had a 42-inch tv plus storage and a safe too. A full-service bar is located up there too. Whenever I went to check it all out, regardless of time, no one was really up there, which was shame because it really was nice and peaceful up there. I'd suggest this property for couples or single friends. I would not suggest kids; it's too metropolitan (a high rise in the middle of town with no pool, beach or in-room laundry). Families should go to the much more kid friendly Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is only a few minutes away. Other relatives were also visiting, but stayed at another timeshare and were totally envious of our modern and spacious room and said multiple times they wished they were staying at Hukalani. As much as I love the Hilton Hawaiian Village, if I have to stay at Hukalani for whatever reason, that would be fine by me.

We stayed at this hotel because of the great reviews and for the fact that it wasn't a big chain hotel . It was a gorgeous & peaceful hotel! The service was amazing! They clean your hotel room EVERY day so you always feel clean and you don't feel like your in a 'hotel' . I loved the roof top pool it's exactly what you need for an adult holiday yes there were a few kids which is totally fine but I'd prefer that then to the big hotels where you have about 100 kids and family's screaming everywhere! The location is 2 min walk to the beach you can see the sea/beach from the rooftop! You are surrounded by shops and restaurants so perfect ! Across the road is Starbucks :) so every morning I would wake up grab a coffee and head to the roof top for some relaxation! Great restaurants surrounding this hotel . I recommend PF changs (Asian) , aroncino on beach walk (Italian) and for breakfast I highly recommend going to heavenly! We did a tour around the island that was so worth it and a good day out! One last advice if you're buying souvenirs for family etc go to Walmart as it is so much cheaper there and you can get all things from keyings - tshirts! Also if your in a group I would taxi it to alo Moana shopping centre because the 'pink trolley ' takes forever and the cab gets you there in 10mins for around $10 !

I am very happy that I stayed here instead of the HHV. This is a new Hilton property that opened earlier this year. To start, the rooms are designed with dark woods, earth tone tile designs and stainless steel accents. Not your traditional tropical Hawaiian style decor, but this hotel seems to be geared more towards adults rather than families with children. Location is great--directly across the street from the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and Starbucks, and only several hundred feet from Kalakaua Ave, the main street in Waikiki. The hotel has a small cafe that is open till 1 pm and has coffee and breakfast and sandwiches available. As you step out the lobby area, there is a shopping area with a few restaurants, bars, and souvenir/convenience store? Warning--there is no self parking available at this hotel, only valet parking which is $35/day.The hotel staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. From the front desk, the concierge, bellman, valets, housekeeping--you name it, everyone was great to deal with! On checkout, I wasn't flying till late at night and everyone was so helpful. From the front desk staff who helped to store my bag while I was out during the day and later gave me access to the pool restrooms so I could change my clothes and clean up before heading to the airport, to the valet staff who had a taxi ready for me at my requested time. This staff was excellent in every way!Since this was a ""girls only"" vacation, I was appreciative of the fact that you need your hotel room key to gain access to the elevators. This made it a little inconvenient for friends who came to visit me--I had to go down to meet them in the lobby to bring them upstairs to the room, but this extra level of security made me and my friends feel safe.As mentioned in other reviews, this hotel has pool and bar located on the roof. The pool is a small lap pool with a hot tub located at one end. This is not really designed for a lot of kids to play in. There are cabanas with TV's available. Evenings were nice and cool, a good place to relax and enjoy a cool drink with our feet dipped in the pool while we planned the following days activities.This is not your typical Hilton timeshare--space is at a minimum here. There is no washer and dryer in the unit. Each floor has a laundry room with two washers and two dryers. We stayed at this hotel for a week and did several loads of laundry with no problem. The kitchen area is stylish but compact. We had a one bedroom unit with a small kitchen area, a two burner stove, small fridge, separate ice maker, and all the usual dishes, silverware, glassware, pots and pans and all the necessary utensils needed. The glassware was stored in a cool pull out cabinet that cleverly rolled out and displayed all the available items in a stainless rack, but when closed, stylishly hid the cabinet from view.The bathroom was the highlight for my roommates! Lol! It had a large double sink area with a large screen TV in the mirror. There was a large shower stall with a large rainfall shower head. It had a large oval designer tub with no faucet, only the hit and cold handles. We looked up and on the ceiling there was a shiny silver disk with a hole in it. We turned the cold water handle and sure enough, the water came down from the ceiling, into the tub in one long smooth stream. Since we don't see these kind of luxuries every day, we were fascinated :) And then there was the fancy commode, complete with toilet seat warmer and bidet! My friends said they wanted to live in the bathroom with all of these amenities!All in all, I would definitely stay at this hotel again! Over the years, between my friends and I, we have all stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on previous trips, and we definitely enjoyed the intimacy and personal attention of the Hokulani experience much more than staying at the larger impersonal experience of the Hilton Hawaiian Village.","Spring, Texas","HoustonWahine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spring, Texas</strong>",35,5.0

The Hokulani Hilton is literally at the crossroads of the most significant shopping in Waikiki: Beachwalk (a nicely landscaped two level shopping arcade that extends about 200 meters to the path leading to Waikiki beach, hence the name), the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, DFS Duty Free Mall and Luxury Row. At night, the area is festive, bright and celebratory. The lobby of the hotel is up the glass canopied escalator which is a part of the two level Beach Walk. One level above the busy intersection, the lobby is private and serene. An outdoor water landscape with waterfalls and torches at dusk and lounge area extends beyond the lobby. Just off the lobby is a nice ""pick and go"" cafe with an indoor/outdoor seating area that looks onto the busy intersection below. However, the selection of cold sandwiches is weak and it was iffy as to whether someone was staffing this area or not. Guests migrated over there for the complementary chilled lemon water. My guess is that the management still needs to figure out how best to use this facility. It's a pity cause this area is so nice and sorely underused. Previous review written in February 2014 said that they provided alcohol till 6PM. Did not see that on our week long stay. Seems to be part of the resort opening shake out. Agree with previous owner that a bar or a breakfast concept would be great here, too underused and desolate. The rooftop lounge is well done. The previous reviewer said that the cabanas were rented out at $200/day in February 2014, by the time we got here in July, the cabanas were free and well used. The sun deck has plush and comfortable chaises. But it was curious to me as to why there were no sun umbrellas. Again, the previous reviewer mentioned that there were staff to help set you up with towels and umbrellas. There were no staff or umbrellas on our visit. Guests were lying with their heads underneath the chaise tables for shade, a sad site. The plunge pool was good enough for what it was. We though it was unfortunate that the length of the pool which could've easily been design as a lap pool was literally divided into halves by a raised portion in the middle, very odd. We were sold on the property and became owners primarily because of the one bedroom suites. The interior design is well done with sleek modern appointment that still manages to be warm and luxurious. Kudos to the interior designer, well done. The bathroom is gorgeous. Take a look at the jaw dropping stand alone tub that doubles as sculpture. The water literally falls from the ceiling. Turn on the in mirror tv as you sit at the vanity - wow. The bedroom and living room furniture and appointment is elegant. We appreciated the ample closet space during our week long stay as we were able to properly put away our luggage. The living room has an electronics, mp3 and radio gadget which is a bit subpar to the overall high quality of the unit, very weak speakers. The unit has multiple outlets to recharge all your different phones which was appreciated. Nice to have though. The kitchen concept is ""adult themed"" rather than family friendly. We loved staying at the nearby Grand Waikikian because of its full kitchen which sometimes felt too large and a bit too suburban. The Hokulani managed to tame it a bit in a more sophisticated rendition of a kitchenette. However, our complaints are thus: 1. Fridge though pretty with the transparent front is too small. For families like us who stay for a week and cook a lot, a half fridge is a wee bit tight. 2. The stainless steel freezer broke during our stay. Also, because it is set into the bottom of the cabinetry, the drawers above were very warm from the freezer motor. It's nice to have an in suite ice maker, too bad ours did not work. Called the house engineers three times. 3. Rather than having a standard coffee maker, capsule coffee makers are provided. They give you 3 caf and 3 decaf. The rest you have to buy downstairs at the cafe. We could not find the appropriate capsules at the market.","Seoul, South Korea","WabiSabiWanderer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",26,5.0

As its right in the middle of all the shopping centre and restaurants, it turned out the best location. We were on a high floor and wasn”t too noisy with the doors closed and AC cranking. Very quiet AC by the way. Bus terminal just across the road at the Sheraton.We had a kitchen with stove, sink, dishwasher, microwave, all fitted out nicely. Separate bedroom with 2 queen beds and still enough room to get around them. 2nd TV and adequate storage for 3 bags and a safe included. Bathroom had a deep bath and big shower with the rose coming from the ceiling, luxury fittings throughout. Even a TV in the mirror and a bidet on the toilet. The main living area had a comfy lounge and chair, Widescreen TV with PS3. There were even an array of phone charging cables to suit most phones. Outside our room was a laundry with 2 washers and 2 dryers, all brand new. Great free WiFi that didn’t drop out.Staff were very good and could book your tours or give good advice on the area.Great security with the elevators and even though there was only a plunge pool on the roof, there were private cabanas complete with, TV”s, refrigerators, lounges, a safe and shelving.Hilton has recently purchased this complex and spent a ton of money renovating with quality inclusions. For me, if staying on the beach with a water view isn”t your highest priority, then this place is for you. It met all my expectations of a great Hilton.","Port Stephens, Australia","GlenAlison</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Stephens, Australia</strong>",45,5.0

It is NOT part of Hilton Hawaiian Village, so this is NOT close to Grand Waikikian, HGV Lagoon or Kalia tower and you can NOT use the super pools at HHV if you stay at Hokulani. We stayed 3 nights using HGV points. LOCATION: Centrally located in Waikiki on the corner of Lewers/Kalakaua above Quicksilver. It used to be the ""Ohana Islander Waikiki"" before it remained vacant for years prior to this remodel. You'll never find it unless you are looking for it from the street because there is no ""store front"", no signs, no awning, just an escalator behind a little wooden kiosk for the valet.VALET: $35/day. There is no self parking available. Again, there is no grand entrance, driveway, turnaround or signage. From Kalakaua, turn right onto Lewers, stay in the right lane and just after Quicksilver (and right at the bottom of the escalators) you will see the valet. Just stop in the right lane and back up traffic like everyone else. I thought it was very dangerous to be dropping kids off with luggage etc in the middle of the road.Once you've found the right place, there are escalators or elevators that can take you up to the lobby. If it's raining, take the elevators. The escalators get very slippery and my 6yr old slipped and fell backwards right as she tried to get on the escalator.LOBBY/AMBIANCE: modern and chic. This place is more for adults, not really families with children. There was only 1 guy checking people in and 1 concierge when we arrived. ROOMS: High tech but on the smaller side compared to HGV Lagoon or Grand Waikikian. Beds are comfy. The BATHROOM is the biggest and best selling point here. Toto toilets with rear and front cleansing shooters FTW! Magic TV in the bathroom mirror. Stand alone bathtub fills from the ceiling faucet (which will make a splashy mess when your kids try to touch it)! Waterfall shower in a separate stand alone huge shower stall that could fit at least 4 people! KITCHEN: Small. The kitchen is not a full kitchen like the ones in Grand Waikikian or Lagoon tower, or any of the other HGV properties we've seen. There was a mini fridge, 2 countertop burners, and microwave to do minimal cooking but no oven. There is an ice maker but this deserves it's own category.ICE MAKER: Loud. if you have sleepers on the living room sofa bed, turn off your ice maker, or it will make crashing sounds in the middle of the night which will scare the crap out of your deep slumber. SOFABED: Very uncomfortable to sleep on to begin with, turn that ice maker off or you'll be up all night. Our sliding door to the balcony DID NOT LOCK, which another reviewer also mentioned. I don't think anyone could come in from the balcony but I'm more worried about my kids going out on the balcony while I'm on the fabulous toilet.VIEW: No ocean view. This is not on the beach or even within view of the beach. If you have kids, it's a 8-10min walk past businesses and through another hotel to get to the beach. Kind of a big deal. If it's just adults, it's a quick 5min walk past shops and through a narrow public access (between Halekulani and Outrigger) to the beach. Not a big deal. POOL: it could be mistaken for a koi pond. The rooftop pool area has great cabanas with TVs and there are lots of lounge chairs to catch some rays but the pool itself is long and narrow like a lap pool.This place is absolutely fantastic if you want to be close to shopping, restaurants, and nightlife in Waikiki. However, if you are traveling with kids and want to play in the pool, go down water slides, rent paddle boards in the lagoon and come back to make your own lunch or dinner in your full kitchen, this is not the place for you. At this stage in my life, I'm always traveling with kids so for me, I'd rather stay at HGV Grand Waikikian or Lagoon tower which have larger rooms and more resort type activities available for kids. Hokulani would be best for: honeymooners, DINKS (double income no kids), or business related trips.","Honolulu, Hawaii","808Momx2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",153,3.0

Lobby is nice. It is located on the corner of Ala Moana and Lewers which makes it a great hotel if you like to shop - if you want the beach - look elsewhere!!!!! There are no signs outside, just the escalator and bellboys eager to assist. The hotel is 2-1/2 blocks from the beach including walking thru an amazing hotel (wondered why we were not there). Most hotels on the beach don't want to rent chairs etc to you. It is also about a 6 block walk to the other Grand Vacations hotels which are exactly what you expect for a Hawaiian Beach Vacation. The Hokulani roof top bartenders are great! The hottub is nice and there is a nice wading pool - about 20' long 3' deep with sitting spot in the middle - good for kids. Nice cabanas. We had an ADA room. The Living/Kitchen area is fairly small, couch/hide-a-bed and small table chairs. Balcony is only good to pull the drapes/windows wide open and enjoy the breeze - you can put a chair on them sideways but that's it. The bedroom is large. The bathroom was bigger than the bedroom - it included two closets, roll-in shower, in-mirror tv and heated bidet type toilet. We sure would have liked the extra space to be living room! If you are there with Grand Vacations and need to take a tour - watch out for Dave.

Everyone was friendly, welcoming, and made us feel like that they truly cared about our experience. I ant to give a special thanks to John, Devon and especially Susan. Susan is a gem and was so kind to my girls. She gave them little homemade trinkets that they really appreciated. I wish I could remember everyone's name because they each deserve a special thanks. If I didn't mention your name, please forgive me as I did appreciate each and every person who assisted us or just gave us a warm smile.The rooms were modern, spotless, and smartly appointed. It was plenty of space for us girls in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 double beds and a sleeper sofa. The kitchen is a great amenity so that we could store left overs and cut down on costs. Others have lamented about the size of the kitchen, but I thought it fit with the design scheme and had everything that we needed. The bathroom was to die for with four ladies getting ready in the mornings as there was plenty of space and options to bathe. Love the soaking tub. Doubly loved the bidet that I didn't know I wanted until now. The café by the lobby is only open half day, but we utilized it every single day. The options were varied, food fresh, and prices were reasonable to me. I expected it to be very expensive, but I thought the price was right for everything. We had fruit cups, bagels, strawberry shortcake, caesar salads, sushi bento, drinks, etc. My only real complaint is that it isn't open all day, but I understand if business flow doesn't warrant longer hours. Many various food options nearby, plenty of shopping, maybe a 5 minute walk to the beach. The rooms have beach towels in the closet if you've forgotten yours. There are free washer and dryers on the floor. Nice! It allowed us to pack clean, dry clothes in our luggage vs sand bags. Wish I could comment more on the rooftop pool/bar, but we really didn't spend much time up there. The bartender was friendly, but we chose to venture out to the beach. The view is nice up there, however. It is also a great relaxation spot to get some peace from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.We love this hotel and we will certainly be back. A beautiful experience all the way around. My girls and I take vacations all over the place multiple times per year and this is one of our absolute best experiences.","Bellevue, Nebraska","YNOL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bellevue, Nebraska</strong>",41,5.0

However, this is one of the more modern and beautiful place I have stayed at. The room, the bathroom, and the kitchen was so modern and very nice. The view from the balcony was very disappointing, but we didn't spend too much time in the room so it was tolerable. The bathroom was so awesome; the kids loved the tub and how the water fell from the top. It is located near the shopping area and the other attraction, but not the beach. We had to take a cab to hang out at the beach, but it wasn't too bad. There are a lot of places to eat around here so you are not dependent on the room service, which was nice. The kids enjoyed the rooms and the lobby pool area. There is a decent breakfast area literally right outside of the hotel, super cool.The valet guys remembered us (may be we tipped with ridiculous $$$?) and was very polite and respectful.I would come back here for a couples weekend, but for a family trip, I would not recommend it.

We had a corner room on the tenth floor and the suites are beautiful. Pros: central location, King sized bed very comfy, 5 min walk to the beach, the best ABC store with a deli right across the road, elevator security system, very friendly and helpful hotel staff. Other reviewers have commented on the distance to the beach - i don't know what route you took for it to be > 5 min walk. And as for the ""complicated"" elevator system another reviewer commented on - all you have to do is place your room card on the sensor and enter your floor - nothing complicated.Cons: no luggage shuttle between Hokulani and Grand Waikikian - this needs to change for HGVC owners. the HGVC speedy shuttle stops by the hotel often enough and it is a no brainer to offer this convenience to owners. Street noise is a problem - could hear the party revellers to the street fights in the early hours. Need double glazing. We have stayed on some of the busiest streets in the world and could not hear the street noise. The sofa bed mattress is about 3 inches thick and is lumpy and uncomfortable. Cafe on site is a beautiful space but was always empty. Prices are reasonable but food looked stale. and with the made to order ABC deli across the road (that accept phone orders for take out!) you wouldn't eat at the cafe. Has a rooftop lounge area with private cabanas that you see on cruise ships - nice enough space but more of an adult space than kid friendly pool.being a new hotel - i was surprised that there was no feedback card. even we checked out - no one asked how our stay was. very surprising for a hilton.","Vancouver, Canada","4Tinky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

Look for a valet kiosk next to the ABC store and what appears to be an unmarked driveway. Right behind the kiosk are escalators that bring you up to ""Cheeseburger"" restaurant which is right next to the entrance to the hotel lobby. You have to stop at the kiosk to drop your car off. The valets will take your keys, count your bags and give you a ticket. When you check in at the front desk upstairs, give the receptionist the ticket, and they will have your bags brought to your room. They only have valet parking for $35/day, but if you want to save a few dollars, you can park your car at the post office a couple of blocks over on Saratoga street for $20/24 hrs. It's about a 5 to 7 minute walk.The elevators are very high tech and take some getting used to. You have to scan your room card to a sensor on the wall (outside the elevator), then type the number of the floor you want to go to. Then you get into the elevator and press the ""close door"" button. There are no floor buttons inside the elevator, just close door/open door. You wouldn't be able to tell how many floors are in the building with this interface, or make any last minute decisions to go to the rooftop. I find that it makes it rather difficult when multiple persons staying on different floors need to use the same elevator at once. I was behind a lady one morning, that by the time I finished typing in my floor, she was in the elevator and the doors closed. I had to take the next one. So I guess you could say that the elevators are made so that you take them up by yourself. The other plus side to this is, your snot-nosed little brats can't push all the elevator buttons, forcing you to take the ""scenic route"" by stoping at each floor up or down. Which by the way, happens to me quite often.The bathroom. Huge and Luxurious. Waterfall shower with optional hand shower. Nice big free-standing tub. Two sinks, plenty of towels, space-aged television built into the giant mirror; something straight out of Star Trek. The bathroom is about as big as the bedroom. There are two closets for your clothes. You could probably have a small party in there. And speaking of party, I feel this next item is of the utmost importance to your experience. The toilet is in its own little room. It's not an ordinary toilet, it's got an electronically operated bidet. Oh yes, much like those fancy massage chairs that you can control the settings to, the bidet can be set to give your ""bat cave"" an oscillating cleansing massage. I must have sat there an extra ten minutes of guilty pleasure adjusting the flow pressure, temperature and oscillation.The kitchenette. Not really ideal for cooking full multi-course meals, but sufficient enough for maybe breakfast and meals that require little preparation. No oven but there is a microwave. Also at your convenience are a heated drawer with plates and utensils, pantry containing lots of glasses, rice cooker and ice bucket and toaster. There's a nice little refrigerator with see-through door, pull out freezer with ice maker and a single cup coffee maker. You need to read the illustrated instructions for the coffee machine. It's not exactly a Keurig. Got dirty laundry? There are free washers and dryers on every floor.The suite is configured to where you can compartmentalize the bedroom or open up the whole space to the outside with all of the sliding doors. That's probably why the balcony is kind of small. You get another 2 TVs in addition to the one in the bathroom and also a Playstation 3. They'll give you a DVD withdrawal card where you can go to the business center and checkout DVD's one at a time for free. (They are actually Blue ray discs)The rooftop pool is more for sitting in and ordering drinks and they do have a hot tub, but the beach is like a block away if you really want to have fun in the water or just relax on the cool sand. If you have the fundage, the cabanas on the roof cost around $175 for the day.Hotel service was great. The valets were very helpful with bags and such, like how to operate the equipment in the room and the front staff were very accommodating. They let us check out at 12 and even offered to store our bags and use the rooftop showers later in the day if we wanted. The location is convenient to a lot of shopping, food, massage, and the beach.

I came out here with my whole family to celebrate my 30th Birthday. I was a little nervous about checking into this hotel b/c of the reviews I read. But after checking in I was impressed. The check in lady was absolutely great. She was very kind and courteous and the bell guy Mike was very knowledgeable about the town. The kitchen is bit small as stated in previous reviews but all in all it's a great room. At that moment, I was definitely happy and excited I was able to book this hotel. And then it all went downhill when I went to get my car from Valet. This is my first time ever reviewing a hotel, but I did it b/c I feel that what happened to me and the hotel's Valet is a MAJOR CONCERN. It makes me question on the hotel b/c of who they trust to do business with. I would hate for what happened to me, to happen to anyone else. This alone would make me not want to stay here again, especially if you pay the price it costs to stay here. The Valet is horrible. First off, they want to charge you $35/day. With that price, I would expect them to take better care of my car, even if it is just a rental. I left my car downstairs with the Valet so I can check in and unpack my belongings. The Valet attendant said he would take my car to the garage while I settle in, and pull it out when I come back. After about 45mins I came back out and they gave me my car. When I was about to get in, I noticed that there was a HUGE scratch from the back of the car, to the front of the car. It was about 8 feet long. I calmly asked the Valet attendant what happened to my car and he said that it was there when we dropped it off. I tried to be calm about it b/c I didn't want to get worked up and ruin my trip. Anyway, I told the Valet guy that the car was not like that when I dropped it off and asked what are we going to do about it. He still continued to go on about how it was there when we dropped it off, and how the other Valet attendant told him it was there when we dropped it off. Meaning he didn't see that it was there when we dropped it off with his own eyes, he took some other guy's word for it and made it his own. When we asked to speak with the other Valet attendant who pointed it out to him, he said he was already off. Then he said that ""oh the bell guy who took the luggage even saw it."" So we asked to speak with the bell guy and continued to ask him what are we going to do about it. Instead of trying to offer a solution or some type of protocol on what to do in these incidents, he immediately went into defense mode and starting accusing us of trying to put the blame of the scratch on them and continued to say ""It was there when you guys dropped it off and all I did was back it up to the garage and pulled it out when you came back."" It was like a broken record. I pointed out that scratch was new b/c the car is maroon and the scratch is BRIGHT WHITE. AND there were still car particles from the scratch falling from the paint. It's a rental car so of course there are little scratches here and there, but you could tell that those scratches are old b/c they are faded. But this scratch was BRAND NEW. Any one who saw it could tell it was a fresh scratch b/c we were still about to wipe off the access residual from the scratch off the car. From the 45mins I took to check in and settle into my room, to the time I came downstairs to leave, there was a huge scratch that was put on my car, and I said I needed to know what happened to it while I left it in their hands. Not only did he continue to say it was there when we dropped it off, he said ""WELL IT'S YOUR WORD, AGAINST MINE!!"" Now what type of customer service is this?!?!?! I expect more from this hotel. That right there made me not only want to scream but it just ruined my entire day and possibly my trip. I asked him for his supervisor and he said he was the supervisor. By that time Mike (the bell guy) came down. He didn't say he noticed the scratch (meaning the valet ""supervisor"" probably lied) and the first thing Mike did was apologize that we have to go through this. And it wasn't until Mike came that we were able to go through the process of possibly resolving the issue. Then Mike got the actual supervisor for the Valet to come out and introduced us to him. At the end of this, I spent about a good 2 hrs from the time I came down to pick up my car, to the time I finished arguing with the Valet attendant, filing an incident report, and filing a police report. And of course, b/c this hotel is located right in the heart of Waikiki, I had to do this in front of everyone to watch. Not only was it draining but it was absolutely embarrassing. I came to my brother's hotel b/c I had to get away from the whole scene. And to top it off, when I got to my brother's hotel, I noticed that the rear view mirror of my driver side is missing a piece. Meaning this is something else that they probably messed up. I was so caught up on the huge scratch on the car, I didn't even think to walk around it again and see if there was anything else wrong. I'm just at the point to where I don't even want to deal with having to go back and tell them that I have something else messed up on my car. I already have to spend my evening calling the rental car company and my insurance to make sure this is covered. This is not how I wanted to spend my first Saturday night in Hawaii. Not only that, now I have to go find somewhere else to park my car, b/c I refuse to go through their valet again. I'd rather park my own car after this. I'm hoping one of the neighboring hotels will let me pay to park in their garages. Not only will it probably be cheaper, but it'll probably be safer as well. Heck I'll probably just stay here at my brother's hotel tonight so I don't have to deal with having to find somewhere to park tonight. And to think I have try to figure out where to park until I check out on March 28th. UGGGHHH! If you were able to read through this long review, hopefully it was useful and hopefully you won't have to deal with what I just dealt with. Definitely ruined my Hawaiian island experience. If after reading this, and you still trust to park your car here, make sure you do a walk around when you drop it off and again when you pick it up. Or better yet, just tell them that you'd prefer to ride shot gun while they park your car. I wish I would've booked a different hotel after this incident.","Garden Grove, California","JTaula</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Garden Grove, California</strong>",13,2.0

Not a noisy room even though we were just two floors above Lewers near Kalakaua Avenue. -very central Waikiki location across the street from the Sheraton Center and a block away from the Kuhio-Lewers bus stop where practically any bus you need will stop.CONS:-early checkout. We were told to checkout by 10am, but got an extension to noon.-no beach. This is a city location, and no privileges to the Hilton Hawaiian Village beach and facilities were made available.-no housekeeping during our stay, but this may only apply to HGVC members.-could not figure out the AC control, so it was turned off at night. -Concierge staff not very helpful (competent), e.g., promised restaurant reservations were not made, and seemed to rotate with the Hilton Hawaiian Village.-no restaurant on site, but plenty of selection at the Sheraton Center across the street.CONFUSION:-physical entrance is by escalator on Lewers Street, but the hotel address is Kalakaua Avenue.-parking entrance is on Kalahaua Avenue, but it's not obvious.-we found it cheaper and less stressful to use the bus and taxis instead of renting a car.CONCLUSION. We would stay here again and recommend it to friends. Key selling points are the room decor/design and location. The hotel was not officially open until around February 2014, so hopefully service problems encountered by earlier reviewers have been solved.

Now I understand the problems that are mentioned on trip advisor. First off I missed my flight to go to Muai for 2 days because their was no Valet person at 5:30 am to get my car. It took the front desk 25 minutes to find them. Luckily I flew with Hawaiian Air line and they put me on a flight a hour after mine. Second the noise from the sliding doors is so noticeable, I downloaded a app for my phone to check decimals, at the bed its 23. The problem is that the sound is not constant, a lot of road noise, the sliding doors don't function because their are issues with the design. This is evident because the locks don't work and they comprised with a hook and a pin. After reading the reviews one of them mentioned about amenity's, they are all true. The gym is a bench with a few pounds, the room size is 14 by 12 feet. No place to stay after dawn, they close the roof top pool, only option is to go on your Balcony that is 2 feet wide, you can't even put a chair outside. What I have noticed is that William always apologizing, so in my eyes I need to be the experiment and loose money and time. Why don't you do something about it, such as reimbursement me some of my money. That would show how sorry your company truly is.","Montreal, Canada","Frank C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",4,2.0

Found out today to avoid Waikiki from October until May, nice to no after the fact. First day could not find the hotel, no sign for parking. No entry to the hotel, only a spot on the road to remove your luggage next to a bus stop. Terrible design, no entry at all. Had to call the hotel for someone to come out and guide me. Thank you Koshi, from there service is excellent. Elevator is a nuisance, you have to swip a card then type in the floor. I love technology. But the elevator doesn't tell you if its coming or what floor your going. Their are no indications on the wall, and once in the elevator no buttons to push. So if you make a mistake it brings you to the floor then you have to get out and re swipe the card to put the floor number from outside. By then the its left and you have to wait. The swiping of the card should be from inside the elevator. Now this might sound picky but I actually cook some of my food and use the kitchen. I can only go out and eat once or twice a day. I have a sensitive stomach...lol. So I like to have simple foods. Well I went to get some chicken to do a stir fry. And their was no salt, pepper etc. Called the front desk and they were surprised, a kitchen with no spices not even sugar. Why have a coffee machine and no sugar. Had to go out of my way to buy it. Now the best part is they call it a resort. With what amenteties. The pool on the roof, is more like big jacuzzi. That's it, no grounds to walk, no gym, nothing. The beach is not 5 minutes as was mentioned to me but 10 minutes so how is this a resort. If you want a hotel to stay at for business for a day or two, this is it. To be where it is with a kitchen, can't understand the concept. I am a architect and appreciate the design,contour, concept of the room however it just doesn't work for a resort....

The emphasis here is not on the hotel and guest services, but on the time share properties. If you have elite status (diamond or gold with the Hilton), do not expect to see any of the usual loyalty benefits: breakfast, water, a welcome drink, or even attention to your room preferences. If those things are important to you, this isn't the property for you, as other reviewers have noted. We were disappointed to arrive after a long flight and to be told that--although we'd asked for a quiet room on a higher floor--the only available rooms were an ""accessible"" room with no bath tub and an open transfer shower (great if that is what you've ordered--but it wasn't what we had requested and paid $300 a night for), or one on the first floor of rooms, right on the noisy restaurant, just above street, level, with a lanai door that does not open. A lot of the reason that I try to maintain loyalty is that I got tired of the experience of having to argue my way out of the room in the elevator shaft. We took the accessible room, which faced the backside of the hotel, as it was on floor eight. We could still hear a good deal of traffic noise, and forget sleeping through the early morning garbage pick up. We also heard a lot of banging that night, whether from a room above or beside us, we couldn't tell. In the morning, a sales person first thing tried to get us to sign up for the two-hour time-share info session.We were, though, able to change rooms the next day. We found Cassel, who worked at the desk, very friendly and helpful (not so much our experience checking in the first evening). We were in a lovely room on the 15th floor for the rest of our stay, and were quite happy. We loved having a kitchen, and it's a very nice little one, with good pots and pans, a good toaster, even a little dishwasher. The kitchen is probably the most unique and pleasant thing about the units. We had no problems with noise on that high floor. it's great to have access to a washer and dryer, and the suite itself was altogether comfortable, with a dining table and small living room area. The bath tub is interesting, with the water pouring from the ceiling into the pipe-free tub. That seems more like a gimmick than a convenience, though--it's a bit awkward to run water while you're in the tub. As others have said, this is a city/ condo experience, rather than a resort experience. The roof top pool is a plunge pool--about a lane wide, with a barrier in the middle. Nice view of the ocean from the roof! The hotel is smack in the middle of the city, surrounded by shops.Oh--we thought that the coffee machine pod coffee was pretty much undrinkable, so I'd recommend taking along some coffee and a drip cone.If I knew I could reserve a quiet room on a high floor, I'd stay here again without question. But given the whole experience, I'll try one of the other Hilton's, aimed at the hotel guest rather than the Time Share crowd, next time.","Walnut Creek, California","literatureprof</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walnut Creek, California</strong>",80,4.0

Location is right at one end of the Waikiki Beach Walk so many restaurants, shops are convenient. The one bedroom with king bed was very comfortable for 2, but privacy could be an issue if you intend to use the sofa bed in the living area for other guests. There are only sliding doors between living room and bed room.There is no parking other than valet which runs $35 per day. We bought a pass for the parking lot at Fort Derussy 2 blocks away and spent less.The kitchenette is more than adequate for easy meals however, I would like to know how they expect you to make coffee when you run out of the few prepackaged cartridges for the fancy coffee maker. When I asked (after 4 days) for a few more of the coffee cartridges I was informed by housekeeping that they are only provided only upon check in, which leaves you no way to make coffee once you run out of the cartridges. There is Starbucks right across the street. From what we could tell, there are really no great views from the rooms in this hotel. We were on the 15th floor but still saw only the building right next door. There may be some peeks of mountain or city but no ocean views.

It's located in the Waikiki Beach Walk, at the corner of Kalakaua & Lewers. This is right in the heart of Waikiki, convenient to many great shops, restaurants, and only a short walk to the beach. Some don't like Waikiki but for me, it is the perfect mix of big city amenities along with a nice beach and being an easy drive away from some idyllic beaches.The rooms at Hokulani are all beautiful suites with vast living space with a small galley kitchen, a private bedroom area, and a large bathroom with rainfall shower and a gorgeous bathtub that fills from the ceiling. There is a TV integrated into the mirror, so you can watch while getting ready at the sink or while soaking in the tub.All of the furnishings are of high quality. There is a luxurious feel to the entire property without the intrusive service you find at Halekulani for instance. I found the employees to be very friendly and helpful. They were there for me when I needed them but were discreet when not. Housekeeping was great-- my suite was kept very clean.Parking is valet only. Wait times aren't terrible and the valets are mostly quite good. The fee is a bit steep at $35 but you are in the heart of busy Waikiki. The valet area is a bit hard to find initially-- look for the umbrella on the Lewers side of the hotel.The lobby is on the second floor and is gorgeous. Great water and fire features along with nice seating. The business center is a nice, complimentary self-serve area just off the lobby. The rooftop pooldeck is gorgeous, with beautiful views of Waikiki, the ocean, Diamondhead, mountains, etc. There is a pool bar and friendly staff. Unfortunately, the pool itself is just a little soaking pool. There is also a small jacuzzi available.Hokulani is my new favorite Waikiki hotel.

The entrance to the lobby is on the second floor of the Waikiki Beach Walk shopping area. When you walk through the doors you automatically feel like you've entered a world of exclusivity. There is a seating area to the right of the lobby that is wonderful, especially at night when the fire bowls are lit and the water sparkles. During the day, this is a fantastic place to sit with your morning Starbucks (right across the street) and enjoy the morning sun. I was told that the lobby bar serves alcohol during the day, but they close at 6 or 7. According to the pool bartender this is because they don't have enough bar staff to sustain additional hours, but it was something that probably wouldn't last much longer. Hopefully he is correct, because they are wasting a great opportunity to make money by serving drinks in this area after dark. All of the rooms at this resort feature one bedroom and are meticulously decorated with a mix of modern contemporary, Asian and Hawaiian. Floors are a beautiful dark hardwood, as are the cabinets, some of the furniture and the bed. The kitchen is amazing. Whomever designed the layout deserves some kind of recognition because they managed to provide every convenience in such a small space. The stove has two burners, the refrigerator is big enough to keep drinks and a few small items cold. Place settings for four are tucked away in a cabinet that is tucked into the wall. There is also a microwave, coffee maker and in-room ice machine. There are also four beach towels tucked away in the closet. If I had to pick something to gripe about it would be that there is only one luggage stand. I would expect in a unit that technically sleeps four, that there would be two. I'm sure if you called and asked for an extra they would bring it without a problem. Also, the safe is located in the bottom right drawer of the bedroom dresser. The bathroom is probably my favorite feature of this place. For starters there is a television integrated into the mirror. So cool. The only other place I have experienced this was at the Venetian in Las Vegas. Be sure to check out the bathtub. The water COMES OUT OF THE CEILING. I didn't take a bath but had a blast watching the tub fill up. Each unit also comes with a Romeo & Juliet lanai. This means there is little room to sit, let alone stand. You are also located about a block from the beach so unless you are on one of the highest floors and facing the ocean, you won't have an ocean view. Odds are your view will be of the city and/or the mountains. The pool is also not to be missed, especially if you are a couple traveling without kids, and like us, aren't particularly fond of them. Lounge chairs are super soft and comfortable. Each come with a set of throw pillows. The pool attendant will give you as many towels as you want, let you pick your spot, and set up an umbrella for you. It is a nice service they provide so tips are appreciated. I didn't realize there would be a pool attendant so I didn't bring cash. Had to go back down to the room to grab a few bucks. The pool is small. Like really small. It's basically a plunge pool, hence my comment about being great for couples who don't like kids screaming and splashing in the water. It isn't kid friendly at all so anyone traveling with kids will likely hit the beach instead. That isn't to say there won't be kids there. We had a few, but they were too small to be obnoxious. The bar serves great drinks and features happy hour starting at 2. Prices aren't cheap, even at happy hour, but you can room charge, which is very convenient. They are lacking food service though. Again, not sure if this is because they are still new and understaffed. I didn't ask. I did ask about hours, and the pool bar, like the lobby bar, closes at 6. Also a shame because the view from up there is fantastic at night with the lights of Waikiki. There are cabanas for rent, each equipped with a television. Was curious about the going rate and was told it was $200 per day. That's a bit expensive. I think others felt the same way because no one rented a cabana during our entire stay. Like all Waikiki hotels (HHV included) you are going to have to pay for parking. The rate at the Hokulani is $35 per day, valet only. The elevators are also a bit tricky and will take some getting used to. In the lobby you flash your room key in front of the sensor then enter the floor number you want. The display will then tell you which elevator to get into. If you are waiting with a group of people make sure you don't just hop on the next elevator that comes by because it won't stop on your floor unless you put the request into the display. You don't need to flash your key to move between floors (i.e. to get to the pool or lobby from your room) but you will need to enter your floor request into the keypad. It might seem like a pain at first, but it is kind of cool, and once you get the hang of it, you'll think nothing of it. Overall this is a perfect choice for Waikiki. I will most certainly be back. We are HGVC owners so I am optimistic that it will be easy for us to return. If you are also an owner and are debating between here and the HHV, you need to keep in mind a couple of things. First, this resort is not on the beach and you won't likely have an ocean view. That said, you are in the heart of Waikiki. Restaurants, shopping, people watching are literally at your doorstep. The beach is a short one block walk away. The HHV is on the beach, however you are far removed from the center of Waikiki. It is a good 10-15 minute walk, which isn't terrible, but if you are looking to be near the center of all the action (and Waikiki is about action), then I would give the Hokulani serious consideration.","Seattle, Washington","Coug1995</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",107,5.0

It's a new hotel so it was a lot quieter than Sheraton or other nearby hotels which we preferred. Our toddler enjoyed her stay and was very comfortable. Great location close to everything in Waikiki. We've stayed at the Sheraton, Royal Hawaiian, Hyatt and for the price, prefer this hotel. Especially if you like privacy and quiet. Tips: grab breakfast at Island Vintage Coffee in the am- great coffee, smoothies, breakfast plates and acai bowls! Also those with little kids, there is a little water spray area outside hotel near the Beach Walk :)","San Francisco, CA","mini_tako</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",18,4.0

Everything you need is available. Next time we would go for the king bed instead of 2 doubles since there is only little space in the bedroom. That is partly because of the big and amazing bathroom. Kitchen is also very handy and fully equiped. Lanai is only to stand there and have a look at the surrondings, you cannot sit there together in the evening. Wifi is free as is self laundry which is nice. Parking is valet only and with 35$ per day not a real steal.Although we had a prepaid reservation they blocked more than 2000$ on our credit card without saying a word. We complained, they said it was a mistake and 3 days later we got the money back. But they did not really apologize for that... Positive: we got a 2 hour late check out at no cost which was nice.Overall really a great stay, without the credit card blocking it would have been 5 stars.","Munich, Germany","smartgirl247</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",118,4.0

We did not get into one of our rooms until 8pm, because the high-tech digital door malfunctioned. The front desk had to get outside technicians to try to fix our door. Meanwhile, we got sent to the roof-top pool which was kind of boring. The hotel just opened, had no liquor license, so there was limited items on the menu. Secondly, the pool was a small plunging pool, so one can't really swim in it. Lastly, it was so windy that we were afraid that our belongings would fly away. We had to complain so many times about the door problem and finally the hotel gave us late check-out on the last day. In conclusion, the rates they charged were too high for a brand new property that was not fully operating yet. It was obvious that the staff was not fully ready either. Communication was slow between different departments (front desk, tech, valet etc.). A property with high potential in general, but just need to get its kinks ironed out.","New York City, New York","cchang2301</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,3.0

We usually go to Maui but since we had not been to Oahu for several years we took a chance. From the minute we arrived we were treated well and staff was very friendly and helpful. The newly-remodeled suite was better than our expectations and the free Wi-Fi worked very well. The kitchen, bathroom and simply everything was of the best type and condition. We took a suite on the 6th floor with a view from the small balcony of Lewers Street below and we were satisfied in that we really didn't hear a lot of noise. Very convient also to a bunch of restaurants right outside the door plus an ABC store on the lower floor where we bought our daily bananas and misc. as we returned to our room each evening. Excellent experience and within walking distance to everything including public transportation and the Waikiki Trolley.

The hotel is tucked away on the second level and feels as if you are entering a calming oasis, the lobby is beautifully decorated with a hugh water feature and an attractive bar area. We loved our room 1208 which was at the front of the hotel and we could see the sea. It had all mod cons eg instant boiling water for tea or coffee, an ice maker 2 hugh flat screen tvs and a play station. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom amazing with a tv built into the mirror. The shower was huge and the toilet was also a state of the art bidet. A small kitchen was really useful and there are washers and dryers on each floor. Air-con is efficient,and a small balcony is really only for decoration. The roof top area had a small pool only really suitable for cooling off and a separate jacuzzi. This area was relaxing as the loungers were very comfortable and if it got too warm relief could be found in the cabanas which included tvs. There is a panoramic view of Waikiki from the roof, The hotel is small new modern clean and the perfect place to come back to each evening. Its situation is perfect for shopping and is just a 5 minute walk to the beach.
