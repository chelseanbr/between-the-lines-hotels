Otherwise, it is a standard Hilton that is huge and busy.I wanted to stay in Shinjuku to see that part of the city more. The hotel is connected underground to three metro stations on two different lines, which was very handy to get around parts of the city. Almost anywhere is convenient to Shinjuku station. I would recommend this hotel purely because of the location!The hotel is 38 floors, so there are a lot of people staying here. Most of the rooms are just standard, since this is a big box hotel. We got an upgraded king room, which wasn’t anything special for the price, but you’re in downtown Tokyo. The room had more storage space for luggage than I originally assumed, because underneath the closets was a lot of room for storage. I appreciated that design element.The bathroom was rather small. The bath and shower area was quite large, but I could barely even open the shower door and sit out. A larger person would have more difficulty even using the shower that way.The concierge was very professional and helpful with securing dinner reservations at restaurants for me. Having a good concierge is key in Tokyo because of the language barrier at the restaurants as well as the time difference.This hotel is very crowded. We had access to the executive lounge for breakfast and for the free cocktails in the evening, but it is rather difficult to take advantage of those benefits because of how crowded the lounge is. In all the Hiltons I have stayed in, this one had the biggest issue with space. And that is not to say that it is a small lounge, I guess just so many people have status with Hilton who stay here, I showed up at 5:55 for a 6pm happy hour and there was already a line and the lounge was full. On a different day when I showed up at 6:15, there was a wait for a table. All I saw were people streaming out of the lounge carrying three or four beers a person. Kind of random.Overall, the hotel is good for location and service, otherwise it’s just a standard Hilton with nothing remarkable about it.",WashingtonDC,"Flyer099</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>WashingtonDC</strong>",450,4.0

Reminiscing about our the wonderful 5 days stay for Thanksgiving. The location was great. You can go underground & connect to two different subway station. They have a free shuttle bus, went to Shinjuku shopping & dining. Also, huge train station, where we caught the Romance train to another Hilton resort in Odawara (with hot spa).The guest relations check in person was Monica Meng, friendly, warm, & professional. She told us about the Romance Train, and how we can catch it. Even promised to get us the train schedule, I didn't think much about it, since lots of hotels don't follow thru. To my surprise, I found an envelope slipped under my door when I was out, and there was the schedule. Got upgraded to Premium Twin beds, with soaking tub. Great after a day of shopping. Breakfast in the Executive lounge was great. View of Mt. Fuji, Fresh squeezed OJ from a large machine. Cooked to order eggs. Then had Champagne or wine at night, with snacks.

The bad the restaurants are pricey but the bar prices are about what you pay in Las Vegas for lesser quality whiskey. The good the staff goes over the top to make you feel welcome. From the moment when we entered after a long day when the staff got our bags to the departure where the staff made a mistake and apologized proffussly, the staff is an example of how you should treat customers. Being Hilton gold we did get an upgrade to an executive room. Something not expeced but appreciated. The breakfast while a buffet was excellent and tasty. The lounge could get crowded mainly because of the cheapskates grazing on the free food. The shuttle to the Shinkuku station helps save the legs. On a clear day you can see Mount Fuji from the executive lounge, we had one partly clear day. I would not hestitate to stay here again I highly recommend this to hotel to anyone.

I normally stay in another hotel but the Hilton were offering great rates. The restaurants are pricy but great food. The train station is right under the hotel and next door is the Park Hyatt (I like the bar there from Lost in Translation). In the train tunnels, there's lots to explore like shops and eateries. I just returned from a quaint little sushi joint for lunch that was playing jazz. The only downfall I have, and even as a loyalty customer is they put me on the 8th floor where my view is a wall and the tennis courts. I guess for the price, this is the type of room you get. It's a shame because I'm here for 9 nights. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is fantastic - I even have a bath tub! But my favourite is the Japanese toilets. Beds are comfy and large, room is spacious. I'm here for work, so spending quite a lot of time in my room and the TV stations are limited in English. There's basically only one English channel that's Fox Movies and most of the movies are over 20 years old or B and C grade movies.

We thought this was a non smoking hotel and one of the reasons we booked it (serious lung disease). The Junisoh restaurant was such a bitter disappointment. Expensive food and extremely small dishes, tasteless food and poor service, we were left alone while other patrons received exemplary service (we assumed they were locals), we would have ordered more drinks but nobody came to our table and we had to actually hail a wait staff to ask for water who then seemed very put out that we hailed them!

The room was amazing, with a very comfortable bed and plenty of room for yoga practice in our room, which is always a bonus for me. For breakfast, the Exec.

Here the crowds were even larger, but the staff cheerfully welcomed us each morning & proptly ushered us to seats. The food selection was just unreal. I've never experienced such a bustling breakfast buffet, but it worked as the staff kept replenishing items and clearing tables. The gym was also super busy, even early in the morning, but again, the staff made all the difference. Cheerful, helpful and efficient, they kept up with the towel supply and managed to maintain a clean, enjoyable workout room.

They stayed they upgraded us to an executive room, but those are the same rooms as the regular rooms, and actually on a lower level than the one we looked at ore selecting on the app before we were upgraded. They said the room would be ready in 15 minutes which was nice although we were disappointed to be on a lower floor with no view from what we were expecting. Our view was of a white wall from a medical building next door. Anyway, our room was not ready in 15 minutes and they told us another 15 minutes. We asked again and they told us another 15 minutes. Finally after an hour our room was ready - this was after the check in time of 3. It was frustrating watching other people go directly to their rooms who were not Diamond members and on floors higher than us. The staff was not as friendly this time. No welcome gift in room compared to other Hiltons in Japan. No bathrobes in rooms.On the plus side, the WiFi is nice, air conditioning works great and the location is nice.

More of the restaurants, bars, and shopping are also located on the east side of Shinjuku station making them closer to a 20 min walk from the hotel.The rooms are getting pretty dated. It's clearly in need of a refresh. This was most apparent with the bathroom, furniture, lighting, and switches. The bathroom was the worst of them.

The location is very convenient in that the airport limousine bus (after picking up luggage, head out to your left passed the tourist information booth is the orange ticket machine for airport limousine bus) from Haneda Airport stops directly in front of the hotel. We booked an executive jr. suite and with executive level privilege, there's separate check in area but we did not need to use for this purpose. Checking was smooth and upon learning that we have kids in tow, housekeeping the brought extra towels, bottled water and toiletries without asking. With executive room, Executive Lounge access with complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails were provided. We can either had breakfast in the executive lounge or the sumptuous buffet on the ground level. Both were fantastic with many choices of fruits, juices, Asian or Western flares. There're other restaurants on site as well but we did not have a chance to visit. If you're craving for ramen and local cuisine, there're several malls within walking distance. We walked over to the building next door and had ramen at Hakkata Ippudo and it was fantastic! While the Shinjuku shopping malls and department stores (Keio, Takashima, etc) can be reached on foot, the hotel provides shuttle service to the shopping mall areas which is a much needed reprieve from the sweltering summer heat. At night we also walked to Shinjuku Golden Gai's narrowed small alleys and tiny shanty style bars in contrast to the neon drenched ""gambling"" clubs and bars of the Red Lights District of Shinjuku (commonly known as Kabukicho). Even with teeagers in tow, we did not have any problems walking around the Red Lights District. We're more at awes at the neon flashing lights, the numerous vending machines (pasta in a can??), Robot Restaurant, and eventually stumbling into Piss Alley (Omoide Yokocho) which is lined with tiny restaurants frequented by locals after work.Sadly, our time only permits 2 nights at Hilton Shinjuku. The day before checking out, the executive lounge staff (Marie?) helped us finding our ways to Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan (taking and connecting multiple trains) and arranging to have our luggage transferred to Conrad Tokyo. The staff was at all times very courteous and helpful, all speak English (which is a huge improvement from what I remembered 16 years ago) and housekeeping keeps the property clean and is very responsive. Room is spacious even with such expensive Tokyo real estate. Location is convenient and within walking distance of malls, major attractions, restaurants, laundromats, etc. We would not hesitate to return and recommend our friends and family to stay here.","La Canada Flintridge, California","kiddofox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Canada Flintridge, California</strong>",88,5.0

As a result of this our return flights were cancelled and we were left trying to source accommodation for 2 extra nights. Initial enquiries with reception were not fruitful as we were told the hotel was fully booked but keep asking as the situation might change. Indeed it did change 1 hour before we were due to check outing we were informed that we could stay in our room. This would have been great had Hilton not asked a frankly ridiculous amount of money. 80,000 Yen which was nearly double what we had paid for the room on the 6 preceding nights.

It is an impressive hotel with large, well maintained bedrooms but scratch the surface and it all is not as pretty as it seems. As a luxury hotel I expected something more but I've stayed in 3 star hotels in Japan offering similar standards for a lot, lot less. My particular bugbear, but not the only gripe, is their predilection for charging service fees on everything. Get a room upgrade, expect to get hit with a 13% service charge despite no mention of this. Get room service and bang there we go again. Everything has a hidden 13% smashed on top - and this in the heart of no tipping Japan. I stayed for six days and this adds up. And they don't take nicely to requests to remove it for poor service or pointing out it's not mentioned anywhere. And service is not great with a certain disdain in the bars and pretty lousy room service with a 30 minute wait. The main restaurant for breakfast is in the main lobby and is noisy. Not only because it is packed but because the marble foyer reverberates every sound. Get an invite to the executive lounge for breakfast, then expect the same cramped conditions and crowds but with a far smaller choice.The breakfast is pretty broad but is not that good and food getting cold is a problem.The hotel has two tennis courts on the roof but a tiny swimming pool. The gym is pretty good though. No sauna that I could see. The restaurants close at 10pm, except the burger and pasta bar which goes on for another 30 minutes. The Japanese restaurant closes at 9.30pm. Room service after 9.30pm is only for burgers, steaks and pasta. There are no restaurants around the hotel to speak of: it's in the business district. Nor anything else for that matter leaving you with a healthy 12 minute walk to the heart of Shinjuku.If you're planning to arrive by metro at Nishi-Shinjuku then get instructions on the way because there are no signs to the Hilton, although it is quite straightforward once you master things.

Who would want to sit in a dirty smelling smoke marinated room. Yuck. Can’t believe you still allow smoking in your hotels. I stayed on a non smoking floor but my sheets still smelt like cigarette. Fruit in the bfast restaurant was all canned fruit from a can. A Hilton hotel can’t provide fresh fruit only canned fruit? Ordered a egg omelette at omelette station. Egg was runny and still uncooked once I got to my table to eat it. Received an upgrade to a suite, carpet had multiple stains. Shower glass was very dirty. Another feature is u can see from the room through a glass partition to bathroom. It’s just covered with a cheap blind. If someone goes bathroom at night it fills room up with light cause blind doesn’t block out the light. Sliding window Japanese style blinds in room are wood and the wood is cracked and broken off around the railings. The lifts in hotel are a joke, so slow, so slow. There are 6 lifts, when u press the button for a lift only one lift lights up to say that that is the lift is coming. So one lift only is dedicated to come get you. What about the other 5? Surely another one could be quicker. Waited over 8 minutes for a lift. The gym are was closed from 8-12 on our check out day so couldn’t use it. No prior notice was given before check in.

Public transportation through nearby Shinjuku station will get you throughout Tokyo with ease. The food options at the hotel are both outstanding in quality and selection. The staff are some of best that Hilton has to offer. Details: I stayed at Hilton Tokyo for a week of work with the desire for visiting some sites. When I suggested a hotel in the Roppongi Hills area, he quickly talked me out of it for many reasons – one was the commute and train congestion in that area and the other was that, in his view, the area was “not so desirable” – he said “you’re diamond with Hilton, why not stay at Hilton Tokyo?” – I didn’t have an answer, other than there was a restaurant I wanted to try in the RH area, clearly I was not thinking straight. My stay at the hotel was exceptional from the minute I walked in the door. The staff are attentive, well spoken in many languages, patient and just overall nice people. Room: I booked a junior suite and was upgraded to an executive one-bedroom suite with views of Mt. Fuji. The room was large, comfortable and well appointed. I appreciated the VERY quiet, very efficient AC system in the room as well as the more-comfortable-than-usual-bed. The views out of the room were fantastic. And there was a Nespresso machine, which was utilized daily.Gym: I utilized the gym a few times during my stay. It is broken out into three areas, plus a pool and tennis court. There is a cardio area, a weight area and another mix cardio/weight area near the pool. The gym was never crowded, and I was always able to utilize all desired equipment during busy times. Restaurants: The ones I visited are located on the 2nd floor, where you will find choices including an outstanding sushi restaurant, a steak house and a Chinese restaurant. I only tried the sushi, which was beyond awesome, and overheard many other hotel guests at the bar (with live music!) just rave about how good their meals were at the other restaurants. The restaurants have an open feel, and it’s almost as if you can mix between them. The space is well designed, open, warm and inviting. Executive Lounge: Simply put, it’s the best at any Hilton property worldwide that I have stayed at. Breakfast options included an omelet bar, various breads and pastries, Japanese options as well as standard English breakfast options. The evening happy hour, which should be called happy-afternoon-evening, was equally well prepared, with options of champagne, red and white wines, a good beer selection as well as any hard alcohols. The food in the evening, as others have stated, can easily be enough for a meal should you choose to stay in for the night. Location: The hotel is an easy walk to Shinjuku station should you miss the shuttle that comes every 20 minutes. There is a pharmacy a couple blocks away should you need to pick something up, as well as the convenience store in the Hiltopia mall under the hotel.","Seattle, Washington","AgileDude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",268,5.0

With the World Rugby Championships going on all over Tokyo the hotel us totally booked with rugby fans from all over the world. It’s a little too raucous and crowded for my needs of winding down from two weeks golfing all over Honshu. The breakfast buffet is chaotic. However, the staff has handled it well. I enjoyed my upgraded room. The service is prompt and courteous. No complaints. The real complaint I have is that I booked the room months in advance with points and cash. However, I found out late one night there was a schedule change and I had to change it to arrive a day earlier on the Hilton website, but somehow I carelessly hit the wrong button and ended up having to pay all cash for an exorbitant nightly rate! I discovered my error within an hour when I got an change confirmation. I immediately contacted American Express about the error. I couldn’t get a hold of anyone at Hilton so I called the next AM I spoke to customer service(?). I got a totally indifferent employee that didn’t care about the mistake and repeated over and over in her bored vice that there is nothing that can be done. Totally detached from the problem. I asked for a manager or supervisor. The same old attitude problem. More or less her attitude was “tough S” and it wasn’t fixable no matter what I said or didn’t and that was that. I was told that I could cancel the reservation but either way I would have to pay for it in full. A great option. She said call corporate. So I called “corporate” at the same number. I got the same response from them. Then they said to call the hotel in Tokyo directly and see if they would help. No luck. I was told Hilton Tokyo can’t waiver the cancellation policy and mistakes are not a reason for mitigation. I was told to call Corporate. So it went on in a giant circle in the several hours I tried to talk logic to someone. The booking was weeks ahead and the mistake was brought up timely. Of course Amex was of no assistance. So I accepted it since it was my error to begin with. however, I do resent that the room rate is between double to triple the normal rate! As a courtesy the Hotel staff in Tokyo did upgrade me as a courtesy as a Gold member. My respect for the Hilton has dropped to an extreme low and I will resume bookings with Bonvoy instead. Hilton, you need to re-examine your policies to consider mitigation or relief under certain circumstances. Especially with the timing. I understand that you could loss revenue from cancelled booking etc. this wasn’t a cancellation but an alteration of an existing booking. Hilton, I hope you view this message and can respond to me.

But overall great hotel nice clean rooms great service great location would definitely recommend to a friend on a smaller budget not looking to pay 5star prices ,"Hoboken, New Jersey","881aryehk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hoboken, New Jersey</strong>",8,4.0

It gets very crowded here too, but we never waited more than a few minutes to be seated and the servers were very kind and attentive.I was concerned that the hotel may feel a bit out of the way from the main part of Shinjuku, and it was. However, this was not a problem as there is a stairway that connects the hotel to an underground subway, which connects to nishishinjuku station in about a 2 minute walk, and also connects to both the area around the Hyatt in one direction and to Shinjuku station proper in the other, which turned out not to be more than a 10 minute walk at a medium pace. The hotel does have a shuttle, but we felt no necessity to use it.There is also a conbini in the immediate Subway area for quick snack, sandwiches, etc., and a place for coffee, which wasn’t needed, due to the breakfast espresso choices being so good at the hotel.We were fortunate to also be offered a one time complementary sitting at the Japanese restaurant for Kaiseki breakfast one morning during our stay. It was also exceptional, and was located in a very modern, pretty restaurant on their mezzanine level, where we sat at the bar.We booked a standard room, but as gold members at the time, they were able to offer us an upgrade after the first night, to a slightly higher class room on the club level floor. It had a pretty view of the Shinjuku area and its neon, and was decorated nicely, with the paper window covering serving as a shield from both light and noise.We were also offered lounge access, of course, which is always astoundingly good in Asian countries. We had a choice to eat breakfast there, but chose to eat downstairs instead, for the full list of breakfast choices.There was an afternoon tea which had very nice cakes, cookies and puddings, and the beer choices from the evening lounge services were also available at this part of the day, and of course a full spread of evening hors d’ouvres which were expansive enough to make a meal out of, with many alcohol choices, ranging from various hard alcohols to an Australian version of Chandon champagne, which was our favorite.They have a overflow lounge for busy periods which is smaller and more exclusive and quiet. They reserve this for diamond members first, but depending on their client demographic at the time, you may be invited here. We were lucky enough to be given a key to this lounge on our third night, and got to experience this more exclusive service for the rest of our stay. The food and beverage offerings were the same but the service was more personalized, and the space lovely, elegant and quiet.Check-in was quick and efficient despite arriving at a busy time, and expediting our move to an upgraded room was handled with ease. We did check-out through the lounge which was also quick and efficient, with the usual friendly staff.We are looking forward to staying again at this hotel in December when we return as Diamond guests over New Years!","Vallejo, California","tequilatamm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vallejo, California</strong>",122,5.0

Spacious and comfortable with great facilities. The one exception was the bathroom was quite small with too little bench space.Breakfast every morning was fantastic with a great selection of food to satisfy everone’s taste. St George’s Bar on the lobby floor was a great place to sit back and relax, the decor harking back to more elegant times. Zatta’s bar was also good, although with a more modern vibe.The hotel is located in the Shinjuku business area about 1 kilometre from the busy Shinjuku station.

(Oh and a special shout out goes to the room service chef who made me a very nice gluten free, late night dinner after I’d spent a very long day of trekking across the city.)Our room was spacious, well appointed and easily met the Hilton standard. Our bathroom was clean and comfortable, but a little dated. We were offered a paid upgrade (several times, by email and in person) to a room with a renovated bathroom, but they wanted an extra $700 AUD for it which was excessive. I have only two small suggestions for improvements. The room had nearly a dozen power outlets, but none near the bed which was inconvenient and seems silly. And the price of food is really too high.

There's also direct access through an underground walkway from the hotel to a subway station which can connect you even quicker to Shinjuku station or anywhere else in Tokyo.Our room was comfortable and with all the amenities one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel, and it had a minimal Japanese styling to it so you get a bit of the feeling of where you're staying,We really lucked out having breakfast buffet included with our stay. Choices were extensive varying from western and Japanese offerings. There’s an omelet bar. The coffee was EXCELLENT and bold tasting. Fresh juices and creative juice mixes are available. Lots of bread options…lots for vegetarians. We’ve seen breakfast buffets at hotels all over the world, and outside of Las Vegas where buffets are at a whole other level, this was the best we’ve experienced. You could set yourself up with a completely different meal every day. The staff was attentive.

We found the location easily accessible due to the underground system (there is a 7/11 and Supermart in the station) but found the service slightly lacking, maybe because it is such a large city hotel that they are just not able to give that fine attention to detail that others can.

They need to check in people faster.LobbyThe lobby is nice, but not grand. There are several (very expensive) restaurants, but no where really to sit. So groups are standing around filling all the free space.RestaurantsThe only place we could find to eat after a long day was a hotel restaurant that changed 3200 yen for a burger. That is excessive by any standard. We walked five minutes down the block.MetroThere is a metro stop two minutes away. It's easy to navigate the train system from there. Go to the touch screen kiosk and plug in special tickets. There you will find a 24 hour unlimited tourist ticket for about 5000 yen (children are less).

Location was great too being that it is walking distance to the metro subway and rather close proximity to a local garden/park for a nice jog in the morning to start the day.The breakfast buffet in the lobby every morning was especially a treat as it was complimentary for Hilton Honors Diamond members. A good mix of Western and Eastern offerings were on full display. Hence, going downstairs for breakfast is clearly the suggested recommendation over the somewhat limited offerings upstairs in the Executive Lounge. The complimentary shuttle bus service every half-hour to/from the Shinjuku station turnaround was extremely convenient and appreciated, especially during the hot and humid Summer days.For those trying to decide between the Hilton and Hyatt across the street, hands down, the Hilton is the way to go.

Besides the stairs at Shinjuku station are a workout. We were upgraded to a larger room, and it was unique in that there was a glass partition dividing the shower/bath from the bed. And it was controllable from the outside, so fun to mess with people who like their privacy. Japanese toilets are interesting and once you got used to them, they make sense and US should have them.The common areas are very nicely appointed and the breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever had, variety and freshness. Fitness room is nice but could have used some free weights and a functional trainer station.If I had one gripe it would be the crazy carpet pattern.

The staff is also very polite and helpful (they translated some things into Japanese for us to help us make some purchases!). But the rooms, and particularly the bathrooms, really need to be renovated. They're clean, but old--the bathroom so much so that it makes it feel kind of yucky. The toilet is also the loudest toilet on the planet. For the price they charge, the rooms should be a lot nicer. The elevators need to be revamped as well, as all of them stop at all 40 floors and are often overfull. (This was the least updated/nice hotel we stayed at on a two-week trip to Japan and Korea, and we stayed at places both more and less expensive.) I am also a Hilton Honors member and was not offered upgraded wifi, or any wifi instructions at all. It's perfectly serviceable, but I wouldn't stay here on a return trip and was disappointed by the room quality for a Hilton.","New York City, New York","ghostie2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",15,3.0

Its a busy hotel with a mix of guests, our room was very comfortable and large enough to spread out a bit as you do on holidays. Housekeeping were excellent in their room presentation over the 6 days we were guests and we enjoyed two of the restaurants during the stay, food and service first class. As I have mentioned in previous posts my partner eats gluten free and especially welcomes gluten free bread for toast in the mornings. On the first morning I approached a staff member standing in the lobby saying hello to guests and mentioned about the gluten free bread, the staff member was in fact the General Manager of the hotel Mike Williamson. Yes I know, who knew General Managers of large hotels stand in the lobby and talk to guests. Mike understood my request for gluten free bread and over that day a large number of his team swung into action to assist us. The Marble Lounge Restaurant Manager Mami Yuguchi met with us along with her head chef and went through the steps they were taking while advising all hotel restaurants regarding the gluten free requirement. The hotel sourced gluten free flour and made a number of bread selections - quite simply service above and beyond. At the same time Food and Beverage Manager Eiji Kondo kept us informed and made our stay something special. Each morning chef Mr Nobuhiro would search us out with the daily gluten free bread and make sure everything was in order. Now having traveled a fair bit to many cities of the world this level of service from what was at the time a very busy hotel was something special. So if you are travelling I recommend to let the hotel now in advance if you have allergies and what they are. With regard to this Hilton - it looks very well prepared for the coming 2020 Olympics. The Hilton Tokyo is certainly worth your consideration for many reasons - a wonderful high performing team working to ensure your time in Tokyo is memorable - is just the start of it.

WOW I am so amazed by you Hilton, a international 5 star luxury hotel brand that do not have a room attendant after afternoon. Luckily I am work in a hotel and know it is a lie, but how dare you say this lie while you are representing Hilton. At this point I am completely disappointed with the “Hilton standard” which the staff can lie whatever they want to avoid any possible workload. And I questioned his lie of the off duty housekeeping team, he then find me a room at 9/f, although he did warn me that the room view will be so much worse but I don’t care, all I want is not see the hospital, so I gladly accepted the offer and going to my room and packed my luggage. After around 10 mins, the manager helped me with the membership program issue and a bell boy has come, and then the manager come to my room and walk to the window and asked me three time, which hospital, where is the hospital, so I explained my worries to him, he then told me that actually my room is not facing the hospital he then take out his phone and prove it from google map, although I am making the fool out of myself but since this room still making me uncomfortable, so I still want to change my room, but then the manger said the new room that they arranged is facing the hospital and convince me to still in the same room. I am sorry to bring so much trouble because of my own mistake, but this is ridiculous, two of the front desk do not know the view of this series at least they need to know which room will be facing the hospital and even the manger need to come to my room and stand by the window and watch the view and question me three time of the hospital and so then prove it with a google map.

On my final night I complained to the night manager and he was very nice and tried to right their wrong. There were some good things about this hotel: the location, the concierges, and the breakfast in the main restaurant. Also kudos to the night manager.

We purchased a Luxury Escapes package which was loaded with value. It included a Junior Suite with Executive Lounge Access including breakfasts with live cooking stations, evening free-flow drinks with premium alcohol, afternoon tea, nightly canapes, free Wi-Fi and private check-in / check-out on the 37th Floor. Arrival to the Hilton was easy from Shinjuku JR station. Walk to KEIO bus station 21 (Shinjuku Sta West) were the Hilton have a free shuttle service departing Shinjuku every 20 mins. You can’t miss the bus as its black and has Hilton decals. Check in was smooth and professional. The Junior Suite room type itself was amazing!! It was huge , around 44m2! More than enough room for 3 people. We were on the 18th floor facing the city, the views have been dearly missed since coming back home! I highly recommend this room type as it gained free access to the Executive Lounge on the 37th Floor. Although access is not essential to having a great experience on your travels, the lounge did come in handy many times. The Executive Lounge gains you private check in/ check out avoiding large lines. You had the choice to eat buffet style bfast at the Executive Lounge or in the main buffet section on the lobby floor. You could access the lounge 24hrs a day. It offered a peaceful quiet setting with parallel dining wings with amazing views out toward the city. It offered free water, beer and juice , tea & coffee. Afternoon Tea every day with small selection of deserts. Selection of alcoholic beverages from 6pm-8pm. An area to kill time and watch the news or surf the net once checked out if your departure is late. All in all very nice perk included in our package. Room keeping did a great job every day. Concierge were friendly and the location was fantastic. One negative was the buffet lunch. It was underwhelming in my opinion due to the cost VS quality of food. Some of the hot food was cold and the waitress said soft drinks were included in the price however were charged on the final bill . I would highly recommend the Hilton Shinjuku to anyone looking to stay in Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia","anthonycirillo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",15,5.0

Sometimes is it perfectly fine. And that was the case at the Tokyo Hilton. First, a couple areas where they went above and beyond. The concierge is amazing. They assisted us with a number of reservations, essential for westerners hoping to dine at good restaurants without paying a service like Pocket Concierge, as reservations are mostly by phone. The spa area is spectacularly. No, it is not technically an onsen because there is no natural spring, but the space is competitive with actual onsens, as the bath area is lovely, the sauna is piping hot, and the staff are attentive. Hard to believe that that it is included at no extra charge.And the lobby and second floor bar/restaurant area are lovely to look at.That being said, the rooms are nothing particularly special. Large desks take up a lot of space in the standard rooms, and the decor is businesslike and drab. They are spacious by Japanese standards and the beds are comfortable, but I did expect something more for the luxury level pricing. Also, there really aren't any other perks for guests. The drinks and food are pricey (though competitive with nearby hotels -- Park Hyatt's are maybe 1.5 the price here). There is no complimentary breakfast and the breakfast buffet is very expensive, and there is no courtesy shuttle. The hotel limo service that offers transport to the hotels in the area is also expensive.Finally, this has no bearing on the review, but it should be mentioned that while other honeymooning guests have gotten upgrades, we didn't get one. I know upgrades aren't always possible given demand, and we did book through Expedia, but since we read reviews that said there were upgrades when we made our hotel decision, it should be mentioned that this isn't customary for every honeymooning couple.In review, the Tokyo Hilton hotel can be looked at as a very fine business hotel or a weak attempt at a luxury hotel. Go in expecting the former and you'll be pleasantly surprised. For true luxury in Shinjuku, I suspect the price of admission will be much higher than the $250/night we paid.",,brendenmgallagher,47,4.0

We mostly stay in high end hotels, yet some of the smaller ones can really teach the big ones a thing or two. This Hilton hotel May impress those who travel infrequently. And it may suit the business person looking for ease, or on a contract.This is a busy hotel. Everything runs like clockwork. Even the egg chef finds it hard to crack a smile whilst flipping his omelettes. Breakfast is basically served in the lobby and it’s a frenzy! Everything you need is there though.This time, because it fitted our itinerary, we booked a Luxury Escapes package. 3 nights, $1300. Non guaranteed early checkin and late check out. Well our flt departs at 10pm tomorrow night and the late check out, after some negotiations, is 2.30pm. Hardly worthwhile. Our room. The remains of the previous guests rubbish behind the rubbish bin is poor but The 2000yen gin and tonic in a test tube size glass with no lemon, and the ‘free drink’ (which was actually part of the package) in the lobby bar that was all ice - very annoying. Hilton has at least now included wifi, as a Hilton member. But in reality they are still catching up with what other hotels offer. Our first two days in the area we stayed in a beautiful 3 star hotel in Narita. To be honest the two hotels do not compare. Everything at the Hilton was available at the 3 star. Service came with a genuine smile and care. The room and amenities were fabulous. Cleanliness amazing. And to top it off, we were given a phone with internet, and free calls (international included) for our use the whole time.My message to retired travellers, do your homework, sometimes you can get better Luxury stays elsewhere.To the Hilton brand - just because we book via an online deal does not mean we do not spend a lot on travel. We spend heaps and we have the time and experience to choose wisely.And for the record, had we known we could not get a checkout around 4 pm we would have been prepared to pay extra!","Sydney, Australia","auntynell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",61,3.0

The hotel arranged for our large group to check in on an upper floor in one of the meeting rooms handing out welcome packages and room keys while handling our luggage. We were served buffet breakfast and gathered before tours in a conference room every day until the cruise ship sailed. The mornings were hectic and the elevators were pushed beyond capacity resulting in long waits and grumpy guests. One morning my husband walked from the 24th floor down to the 3rd or 4th floor to the meeting room for our tour. Walking down the stairs wasn’t an appealing option for me since I’m recovering from a broken leg but I considered it when the 3 full elevators stopped and left a growing group of us. Eventually we got on an elevator going up and just rode it up to the 31st floor and then down. It was an inconvenience exacerbated by jet lag. This is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful even when dealing with frustrated guests. The shuttle bus running from the hotel to the Shinjuku train station was convenient and made getting around so easy. The signage with the schedule and location of pick up was excellent.

The bathrrom set up was not ideal in my opinion. The shower plus bath tub are in a separate room within the bathroom. You cannot avoid getting water into the bathtub while showering. I felt bad dirtying the bathtub indirectly every time I showered. The executive lounge had just reopened after being closed for serveral months for renovations. I did not like tge lounge set up, as there were two separate lounges and sometimes the food options were different. The staff was very nice and professional but they seemed understaffed/overwhelmed. Perhaps it was due to the hotel being full for Golden Week, but there was lots of laspe in service. For example, the soup spoons and bowls ran out and no one replaced them for 15-20 minutes during evening cocktail time. We put our names on the wait list for lounge use due to the lounge being full and were not called back until an hour later. Also, we did not get any recognition for being Diamond. Other hiltons sent personal emails to welcome us pre-arrival, left us a card in the room, and/or provided a welcome gift. We did not get anything other than one hour later for checkout, and that was because i inquired about it.Convenient location and free shuttle to shinjuku station were appreciated.

This time however (4-nights stay May 1-5) was not good as the hotel appears to be unable to deal with full occupancy. Hilton Diamond ""upgrade"" at check-in to a so-called corner room rather than a suite was understandable since this is a busy period, except that the corner room (1829), is not in a corner at all and as far as I can tell is no different from the other rooms on that floor. Housekeeping is not available after 6:00PM (surprising for a hotel of this category) and repeatedly failed to show up when called within their business hours (had to call 3 times today before they finally came). The renovated Executive lounge looks the same as the previous lounge and every single day there was a line to get in. I got seated at the ""counter"" (i.e. no table available) every night, caught a cold from the aircon that was blasting next to the only place where I was allowed to sit (at some point I moved to an empty table and was politely asked by an attendant to get back to my counter seat, which is unbelievable). Cocktail hour is from 6PM to 8PM. As I came in at 6:40PM tonight I was asked ""do you need to be seated?"", then ""can you wait in your room and we will call you because we are full""? After I explained that the cleaning staff was in my room because they forgot to come earlier and so I could not wait there, a counter a seat magically appeared (next seat remained empty). Overall a very disappointing stay, I hope this is an exception due to the holiday week-end. And whoever renovated the lounge should have thought of a better design, there is just no place to sit while tables for 4 are routinely occupied by single travelers who arrived early. The only positive was the lobby floor's restaurant breakfast staff, who was very nice and efficient.","North Miami Beach, Florida","UPG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",61,2.0

They artificially create over 10 types of the rooms so that at their mercy, they can “upgrade” you to next level but in fact you are not. Say if you are a diamond on an award stay, you will be upgraded from tier 10 room to tire 9 room.Some of the obvious bummers of the room. 1. Low ceiling. If you are taller than 6’ you will feel the pressure from top, at hallway and common area.2. Splashing shower water onto bathroom ground.3. Thin wall. Enjoy free TV audio shows from your neighbor.4. Very average amenities. In room instant coffee. Really?Although none of these will ruin your stay but for “high end” hotel with a minimum nightly price over $300, it is hard to accept.

The room was clean and spacious and, like other Japan Hiltons, had a really awesome bathroom with a shower/bathtub combo. As Diamond Club members, we were informed at check-in that the executive lounge was being remodeled. To compensate for it, the hotel instead provided access to a great bar for happy hour and access to the buffet breakfast in the morning for food. The food options were really good, and fresh, however, not as fresh as our stay at Osaka Hilton. This replacement for the executive lounge was awesome. We stayed at a property in Houston where the executive lounge was also undergoing renovations. The Hilton property gave us some soda and bag of chips and thought that was the same. It wasn't. The only downside to this hotel stay was the service. Throughout Japan we had friendly, welcoming service where everyone provided an 11/10. Especially at Osaka Hilton. When we checked into Tokyo Hilton, the staff were all harried and the check in agent was gruff and short with us. He did his job but the difference between the quality of service at Osaka Hilton and Tokyo was huge.

One thing we noticed in the lobby is the lack of seating. Perhaps this is due to the the restaurant taking up a rather large portion of the lobby. There are many enough seats for 7 people in the lobby and while everyone is waiting for shuttles, limo busses, etc, there's a lot of people standing around for long periods of time at times. Other than that, the staff are very polite and helpful. I think almost all of them spoke english which was helpful and convenient as english speaking foreigners. The lobby is also very nice in general with a little section with baked goods as well. There is a complimentary shuttle that runs around every 20 mins from the hotel to shinjuku station. If we were planning to take the subway at shinjuku station, we would just go to the subway station below the hotel (M09), which is just one stop after shinjuku station (M08). It cuts down any time you have to wait for the shuttle and it's definitely less busy at the subway under the hotel (I believe it's called Nishi-Shinjuku Station). So depending on our situation, we utilized both the shuttle and the subway under the hotel.There are also a bunch of vegan options at restaurants at Shinjuku station for anyone who needs one, because you won't find any options at the hotel. The rooms were okay, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a little awkward in that it was small and if you were trying to open the shower door, it's a very tight situation in there. Most hotel rooms in Tokyo are small. Still, I have stayed at another hotel that I think the bathroom space was better. Last time I stayed in Shibuya and I think if I was back, I might stay in Shibuya again over this location just because it seems more convenient where you can walk to everything in Shibuya. Even though Hilton offers a shuttle, it's just not as convenient to just walk outside to everything. So in the end location does matter.

We were a couple of days early, but still were able to enjoy some blossoms in the park nearby. The hotel is super busy all the time. The lobby has way more action going on than most hotels, every day there was a 50+ person lineup for their afternoon tea. With this kind of trade, there is little need to go beyond for your customers. So no upgrades, no late checkout, and not even a club lounge to visit. I'm not saying it was unprofessional or mismanaged, exactly the opposite; this hotel is a well-oiled machine that churns guests through with few hiccups. You don't go away feeling that anything was missing, nor do you get a feeling of being special. But for me, when I am spending more than $700 USD a night for a hotel, I generally find I go away feeling special or recognized in some way. I'll have to come back to Tokyo to see if that's the norm of the culture or just this hotel. Concierge was knowledgeable about the area and the shuttle to the train station was particularly useful. The room was a large suite for Japan, with a very comfortable king-sized bed and a huge shower with strong pressure and hot water. The tiny tub was only good for bathing children. Having two chairs at the desk was very useful for my wife and I both to be able to work on our computers, but the window blinds made the room have a bit of a prison like effect. I didn't get to try the pool, but had a feeling based on the buzzing activity at mealtimes in the hotel, that the guests in the pool would be like dumplings boiling in a pot.We took the train in from the airport and the limobus back. I have to say the train is the better choice if you suffer from car sickness.","Shanghai, China","chadontheroad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",76,3.0

The drive is about 2 hours and will cost >$200 USD. If you book in advance, you can get a set rate of about $150 but still is not the way to go. The best choice is, after going through customs, look across the walkway to the left and get in line for the Limousine Bus service. For $29, you get a comfortable drive to the hotel getting dropped right in front. Maybe takes an addition 15-20 minutes but a great value!

There were definitely lots of people who werent hotel guests who specifically came for the buffet. Originally when we arrived we tried to book for our third night to have dinner here but was told the only place available was side table sitting side by side. We didnt think this was ideal and the staff went above and beyond to get us a very nice table for two in the end. Very impressed. Back to our actual stay at the hotel... when we arrived, the place was definitely buzzing but not overly busy that we have to wait for long. This was for our last leg in Japan and we had stayed in other hotels around and we found Hilton has the best bed and pillows! It is no surprise as our family always trust the Hilton brand and stayed with Hilton whenever we travel. In the first night, there was plumbing issue that cAuse a lot of inconvenience. The toilet were rattling every time so often which interrupted our sleep significantly that night. Engineering was called around 11ish and they couldnt replicate the problem because it happen so randomly (and loud) that u just cant wait for it unless it happen, i did took a video to show them the issue so that it didnt look like i was imagining it. The reception offered to move our room right away but we refused because it was very late and tbh im super exhausted and wishing this will go away(it didnt). And surely enough the pipes keep rattling loudly all night at random intervals. By about 5am i was fed up and went to the lobby and decided to take up their offer of moving room but i said i need time to pack up first. I then tried to catch up on some sleep time as much as i can (no luck) until we have to go to our activity at 8am, by that time our luggage are now fully packed and we are ready to move room. So the staff said that i can come pick up our new room key later this afternoon and our luggage will be moved to the new room while we are out and about. Nice.In the evening, we were moved to a corner room at a higher floor which is bigger than the original room we were given and no plumbing sound. I do appreciate the bigger space though i specifically go for Hilton hotels for their bed mainly. We were sleeping so comfortably that night and the following night.I think that while issues do come up here and there, what makes a hotel great is their ability to resolve their hotel guests problem. And in this very case they did and we were very satisfied with the result despite the interrupted sleep on the first night. Overall i find the staff very helpful and speaks english very well.Also, location wise this hotel is connected to the nishi shinjuku station so i can catch a train down from basement, i also walked to shinjuku station (catching pokemon) without much effort in terms of distanxe. There is also a hilton free shuttle every 20 minutes to and from Shinjuku station which makes this hotel very convenient. There are also a lot of dining options outside the hotel so we were very well fed through out our stay here.

It’s close to some restaurants and shops and there is a iLand building nearby that has some restaurants (eg. Udon and ramen, Japanese and western food). There is also a free shuttle bus to take you from the hotel to the middle of Shinjuku town central. The hotel is not in the middle of a happening area - so there is still a need to take the shuttle if you want to get into the main bustling Shinjuku area (about 10-15 mins bus ride).Service at the hotel is good and I especially liked the house keeping staff. Polite and friendly and I noticed that they do take away the cups and glasses to be replaced or washed. Even though we booked 3 suite rooms and all were on the same floor - the rooms were different. Some were larger with smaller bathrooms and one was smaller with a larger bathroom. The biggest complain we have would be the breakfast - although the spread was okay with some western choices and Japanese / Asian choices, it wasn’t as good as some other 5 star hotels that we have been to. In addition, there was no variety. It was the same thing on a daily basis. Maybe we have just been spoilt by other 5 star hotels and the expectation on this is higher.The strawberry buffet for dinner was very good though.Is this a good hotel for a stay in Tokyo - I would say that yes it is if you wanted a good hotel in a quieter location in Shinjuku.

The location in Shinjuku is a little bit further away from all the bright lights and action but I found this a good thing. One of the best things about this hotel is the FREE shuttle bus it provides to Shinjuku station which made it very convenient and it ran every 20mins so you never waited long. You can walk the 15-17min to the same destination but this was a great option when it was cold or I was too tired. The Hilton does everything a major hotel does well – great breakfasts, good service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, etcI believe I booked a King room and it was large for hotel standards and very large for Tokyo. Hard to fault this place and I would come back to stay.Other helpful pieces of information:• The Airport Limousine Bus from Haneda stops directly in front of the Hilton which makes it wonderfully convenient. This is the most economical option and it was very comfortable.• There are actually two train stations close to the Hilton: Nishi Shinjuku and Tocho Mae (on the Oedo line). • Good quality gym with quite a few cardio machines and good size swimming pool• It is right next to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building which is a great place to go for views of the city that are free","Sydney, Australia","Tracy L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",21,5.0

However, I wish I could say the same about our return 2019 stay.From start to finish, the hotel just didn’t deliver. We are Hilton Honours members but booked a Luxury Escape 5 night club room package on this occasion. We arrived at the hotel to be told our room was ready, however 10 minutes later that changed and we were told we would need to wait 2 hours. We headed out and returned back later in the afternoon, only to wait over 60 minutes for bags due to miscommunication (three times!) between the front desk and the concierge team. To top it off, we were informed that the Club Lounge was “shut for renovation” until April. The hotel created a make-shift lounge in one of the bars but it just wasn’t the same and the ambience was terrible.The room could best be described as “ok”. It was certainly nothing special, the bed was firm (we asked to switch but were told it was the softest bed they had) but for the money we paid, you couldn’t help but feel disappointed at the size and layout. The positives were water pressure in the shower and the amenities. The restaurants are over-crowded and despite a wonderful breakfast selection, the breakfast period was like feeding time at the zoo with far too many people. We tried to make reservations several times for dinner (in the morning, not at the last minute) and were told we could not be accommodated. We leveraged a teppanyaki dinner included as part of our Luxury Escapes dinner but were left feeling hungry and disappointed once more at the quality of the dishes. The location of the hotel is good - it’s still a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway and probably 10-15 minutes to Shinjuku station, but we enjoyed the walk. We left the Hilton after 5 nights and both agreed that it was a disappointing experience. The hotel just couldn’t seem to get the little things right. There were a few outstanding team members who did their best to rectify the issues but it just wasn’t a great stay.

We probably didn’t check it out properly but it turned out that this suite does not have a separate living area. Our bad but we were out most of the time anyway. The Executive Lounge is small, dark and crowded. If you are not the first ones in there, you will probably have to queue or go to another restaurant for breakfast. Thankfully they offer to phone you when a table is available for canapés. Staff are very professional and English proficiency is high amongst staff.

So our expectation of the brand and level of service is different. Hilton Tokyo is a disaster. Location is far (walking) from any nice restaurants and commercial areas. Always a long subway ride and walk away. Second, the front desk is horrible in giving the WiFi password and checkin anyone in. Lines are too long. WiFi is slow, too. To the room, the furnishings is old and outdated. Tv is old, the desk has bad design that will stub your toe and the worst part is the toilet we had did not have a seated seat. Even the mall toilet or the lower star hotel we stayed in had a heated toilet seat. But not the toilet in Hilton 36th floor. The gym also is like a tiny 10 sqm of free weights. It’s pretty much like a treadmill and elliptical room and swimming pool. A joke to be called a gym.So that’s the main issues location, room and services all with failing marks.

Executive check in was professional. We were served drinks whilst we waited for check in. The lounge had views across to the mountains and tokyo sky line. As we checked in around 11 they had sandwiches, cakes and pastries on offer, with juice, soft drinks, tea and coffee available.We had an executive junior suite room 825 on the 8th floor, quite close to the lift. Despite this we didn’t hear a thing and didn’t see any one else get on or off the floor, it was as we were the only ones on the floor. The room is quite big by tokyo standards. A roll away bed was put in place for our son and we still had room with a large couch setting. We were surprised to see a nice card and some biscuits from the hotel celebrating out wedding anniversary. The staff in the lounge remembered us each time we went there.With lounge access we could choose from the lounge, the marble restaurant on the ground floor or the Japanese breakfast on level 2. the executive lounge staff were more than happy to book the Japanese breakfast for us as they only run at 7, 8 and 9. The Japanese breakfast comes in a tiered bento boxes with a great deal of thought put into the presentation. It wasn’t as filling as a buffet breakfast but is definitely worth a try. The marble lounge was quite busy on both mornings we tried it. It had a mix of western and Japanese dishes like the standard fair of baked beans, hash browns. Juices were limited to orange, apple and grapefruit, however there was a smoothie station at the back which was a nice surprise. We like the made to order ramen and egg stations, they even had soy lattes you can order, However, the marble lounge and executive lounges seemed to be quite hectic. The evening canapés were a bit mixed, the pasta salad and rice salad were nice. The make your own salad was also great, but there wasn’t much of a Japanese flavour to the food on offer. Each evening changed though there were the same basic salads etc. the only thing lacking was a desert corner. The chandon, wine and hard liquor were busy corners of the lounge. Tip – go here before 6 to get a table. Saturday night was busy and we had to go back to our room to wait for a call when an empty table became available. The lounge layout is divided into 2 sections. The section on the right has windows facing mt fuji. We were lucky enough to see my fuji early one morning from the executive lounge.We used the pool and although it was small we were fortunate to time our visit where there wasn’t any one there so our son enjoyed the pool to himself. The staff at the fitness centre checkin was friendly and spoke good english.The shuttle service to Shinjuku station is quite handy and very efficiently run especially on cold mornings and evenings. The hotel is also connected via an underground walk way to both underground stations - nishi-shinjuku and Tocho-mae (about 3-5 mins away for both).There was no turn down service as you might expect from a five-star hotel.We like the Evelyn and crabtree verbena and lavender bathroom products. The heated toilet seat was lovely during our wintry stay.

The range of food at the executive lounge from noon to evening was limited and of average quality. There was a staff who went around refilling the guests' glasses and having small talks with them and these guests happened to be of the same race. It was probably because those were regular guests or maybe they just happened to be having the same drink.Buffet dinner - Range of alright, could be better.

Not too sure about this since we have seen better elsewhere. However, it has served its purpose. The complimentary shuttle and room size are plus points. Executive lounge......can give it a miss.

The room costs the same whether there are 2 of you or 1 of you but that is then not reflected in the club lounge charges and it should be. People who are by themselves should be able to have free club benefits for others because the costs would still be less than having a second person in the room and them having breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks, beer/wine and dinner every day v's a cup of coffee!I had to negotiate with them that their excuse that it gets busy was not based on reality as the lounge was empty after breakfast and before dinner when my meetings happened.The lounge is being refurbished apparently. It needs it.Not especially customer focused though as I am sure the extra charges will still apply.The gym is very limited. There is no cycling of any kind only running and cross trainers. The weights section is very small, only 2 people at a time can use the limited number of weights and there is no additional equipment.The rooms are small and bathroom is not well designed.I know it's Japanese culture but cutting all the windows in half is bizarre when most of your audience are not Japanese. It makes everywhere much darker and means less people can see the views.Some of the staff in the lounge were very nice and very helpful, others more jobsworthy.The cleaning was also bizarre, the room gives a teapot with strainer but no leaves so I put a teabag in and the cleaners didn't empty...maybe they thought I liked cold stewed tea!One of the great things about the Hilton was the range of bars and restaurants which is extensive and to suit all tastes.

Prior to our visit we had a few emails with the manager Albert, which was really helpful and he was very kind to assist us. The location actually turned out to fine, the shuttle bus was easy to get and there were two smaller stations super easy walk away and the walk to the main Shinjuku station was only 20 mins. We got the airport limo bus, which I would highly recommend, as it drops you right to the door and staff help you with your bags immediately. We had been tempted to get the train, but so glad we took the hotels advice and booked the bus. Stress free and comfortable easy journey. Check in was smooth, our room wasn't quite ready which was fine, but Ernesto a manager was on hand and went out of his way to get a room that was ready for us. This was really appreciated. We were pleased with our room. We had an upgrade to a junior suite and it was specious and modern. the bathroom was particularly great. We also ordered Yukata robes for use in the room, which was so comfy I really wish I'd bought one! As diamond members we had use of the executive lounge. In general this was good. There was a good selection of food and drinks in the evening and a lovely afternoon tea in the afternoons. Breakfast there was also great. In fact we only did the main breakfast room once in our stay, preferring the executive lounge the rest of the time, which is usual for us as we have very different breakfast tastes we usually find we need the main lounge to both get what we like! Staff in the lounge however were quite mixed. We didn't find those on in the afternoon or evenings particularly friendly. They clearly know who the regulars are and spent a lot of time chatting to them and helping them. Only giving us limited help when we asked and moving on to others they knew. I can understand this to some extent, however it does make you feel like a second class citizen in a hotel you've paid a lot of money for. The only exception to this was Waku who worked the morning breakfast shift. He was so friendly and helpful and chatted to us, giving us tips and making sure we were comfortable. We didn't eat in the restaurant apart from breakfast, so can't really comment except to say breakfast was delicious. We also had drinks in the cocktail/jazz bar one evening which was great.Overall we enjoyed the hotel and would like to return, but we did stay in a significantly cheaper hotel in an easier location for our second tokyo trip.

Tokyo is a huge city so deciding where to stay can be a daunting task. We were fortunate that the Tokyo Hilton fit the bill. The hotel is located in the Shinjuku district of the city. It’s is a commercial, retail and entertainment hub with countless options located within walking distance. The hotel is directly connected to a metro line and Shinjuku Station is less than a 10 minute walk. The hotel is a stop on the bus lines that run directly to both Haneda and Narita airports. A great option. The hotel itself provided an upscale experience. I would not call it luxury as it did not have an air of exclusivity, but it was nice. Check-in was fast. Our room was on a high floor and offered a lovely urban view. The room was nice, and clean. We had a city view junior suite. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The linens were nice. Temperature control of the room was easy. The room had a Nespresso coffee machine which was restocked daily. The bathroom was a little small but it had everything we needed. It also had one of those high-tech Japanese toilets that requires a tutorial if you plan to try out the many different functions. I have two areas of dissatisfaction with the room. The first was there was no comfortable chairs for sitting. What was there lacked backs and they were too deep. They looked stylish but were not functional. My second issue was the lack of sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear EVERYTHING coming from the guest room adjacent to my bedroom. I do not expect that in an upscale hotel. The hotel has four restaurants and two bars and is walkable to any kind of food and nightlife you would want. Of note, one of the bars is a smoking bar. Not complaining. Just saying. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member we had access to the Executive Lounge. As far as lounges go at non-US properties it was not one of my favorites. Quite simply, it is too small for how many people are using it. There were times at breakfast and in the evening when you had to wait for a table. The tables were also very close together. I also didn’t like that at 9pm the lounge is closed and you have to leave. For people looking for a convenient, reasonable priced upscale option in Shinjuku I would say the Hilton is a decent option.

I have been to better lounges under the Hilton brand elsewhere. Perhaps this needs some leveling up. Otherwise, the staff were all friendly and provided excellent service.Breakfast at the Marble Lounge was also a busy affair. It could be chaotic, but you can get a wide variety of food choices there. I like they specially prepare the fruity yogurt shakes in small glasses.

Very good business class hotel, with a good executive lounge for Honors members. The breakfast options were very good, all fresh, all presented pleasantly. In the evening, you have to be there 5-7pm for the happy hour to get pre-dinner snacks. These were OK, but not sufficient to allow you to skip dinner afterwards. The rooms were clean and neat, housekeeping did a great job straightening our mess. The hotel is close to transportation, shopping, and to the Shinjuku area, and it is also quiet and a little away from the action, so it isn't too noisy.For getting around, there is an underground shopping area access by stairs near the lobby restaurant. There is a mini-mart there for light snacks and any toiletries, and you can also access a walking tunnel to take you to the nearest metro station (you really want to take that instead of walking to Shinjuku station, which is large confusing and busy). In fact, there are tunnels connecting things all through the area of the hotel, which are god options to get around without worrying about traffic, crossing streets, etc.One last advantage of the hotel is that it is a regular stop for the airport bus to Narita or Haneda. Unless you want to spend a lot more, or be a lot more frazzled by using public transportation, this is the best option from either airport.","San Diego, California","Bob H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",25,4.0

I was expecting some tired 1972 hotel luxury but the Tokyo Hilton (even though it's cheaper than the Conrad Tokyo) is very nice, and quite recently built. Our bathroom (in Room 2519) included a huge unified 6' shower stall and massive porcelain soaking tub, so that during a shower you can stretch your arms out in many directions. You have to close up a modesty panel so that the person in the bed room section can't see directly into the windowed shower! The Hilton Tokyo (In the Shinjuku area) is halfway between two nearby subway stations, on different lines. Once you're free of your luggage, you can get to either of them from underground passages entered from the (modest) Hiltopia Mall-which has a stairway to the Hilton lobby. You have to go outdoors for no-stair subway access. We rolled our bags to the Tochomae station elevator. This is past the Hyatt front stairs entrance, and by TMG Tower #1, Observatory entrance. (That popular FREE observatory has a massive line, so we never went up.)We particularly liked the massive lobby breakfast buffet, but it's no bargain if you have to pay for it. When we don't have time for serious restaurant-going, we sometimes book Executive Rooms and subsist on free heavy hors d'ouvres for dinner. That worked fine here. The executive lounge is a rabbit-warren of multiple rooms, with not enough window seats. The staff doled out the window seats like restaurant hosts. The food was fine, but not a huge variety. It was very busy in the lounge, but we got the food and wine we needed.","Bergen County, New Jersey","obsoperator</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bergen County, New Jersey</strong>",264,4.0

Decided on the Hilton Tokyo. Must say this was the third Hilton we stayed in this year around the world and after this stay will be the last as we notice they all have poor sound proofing and provide poor sleep. Stayed four nights and initially booked a king Deluxe. Last minute upgraded to executive room and got a twin. Was a newly renovated room with nice looking washroom. Wall along the back if the washroom was glass and could move to see the room. Provides more light to the washroom. Room felt a bit small with the two twin beds. Hotel is in good location and has a shuttle to shinjuku station every 20 minutes. Provides easy access to food and shopping. Also has lower mall with a 24 hour store for food, drinks and amenities. Lower mall has an Italian and Indian restaurant. Also easy access to two subway lines. Unfortunately the sound proofing is not great. All night I could hear the upstairs guest stumping around his room. Could also hear occasional bangs when they would open the closet door or minibar door. I noticed this in our room when I opened the closet door. Complained and moved rooms to a higher floor on the 37th floor. Was not a renovated room but felt bigger as bathroom was smaller. Still poor sound proofing as could hear guests walking and opening snd closing doors. Two nights of poor sleep. Moved again to the 38th floor which is also not renovated. 37 and 38 floors will be renovated in 2019. Unfortunately still noisy from side guests. Anytime anyone opens the closet or minibar door you will hear a loud bang. Heard another guest complain about the same at the breakfast one morning. Executive lounge is good size and offers some food and drinks. Breakfast can be taken here or Marble buffet or a smaller Japanese breakfast in the sushi bar. Only has 15 seats so more quiet and intimate. Buffet is basic and not awesome, just average. Lounge is quiet during the day but at cocktail hour becomes a drink fest with loud boisterous tourists. Could hear conversations from other guests all the way down the room. People would drink and one group of three had 8 Asahi beer cans sitting on their table at one point. Staff try to clean but at times tables can be left uncleaned for a long period. No class either as I saw many people in shorts and flip flops (in November!!). Had the seafood buffet in Marble restaurant. Made reservations and asked to be seated away from the bar which allows smoking. Host wanted to seat us right in front of the bar when we arrived. I stated we had asked to be away from the bar and he replied all those other tables were reserved Yeah, we had a reservation too. He finally checked and moved us far away. We asked about a table and said it was reserved. People did not show up until 2 hours later and these were no even hotel guests. Many people in the restaurant were local young Japanese females out with friends. Who else comes with umbrellas and jackets. Did not see many people that looked like guests and restaurant was 1/2 empty. Overall the staff was nice and supervisor to the lounge apologized and helped us with the noisy rooms but I would not stay here again. Lobby is always busy and reception is always crowded. Hotel is too noisy in the rooms from poor sound proofing and too many guests. Too many other options to pick from in Tokyo that allows you to get a good sleep. Do not recommend this hotel to others Had a better stay at the Mercure Ginza. ","Toronto, Canada","Cantquittravelling</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",70,2.0

Travel time took close to 2 hours because we arrived sometime in the afternoon on a weekday.Check-in: It was quick even though there were a lot of people in the lobby. (Well, most of them were there for the dessert buffet.) We were in our room 10-15 minutes after we arrived.Room: Our room was a Junior Suite, around 44 square meters, which is quite spacious by Japanese standards. It is an open concept suite so there were no division between the living room and the bedroom. The windows are done in Japanese style and there are two Yukata available in the drawer. The bathroom has a tub and standard Japanese toilet.Executive Lounge: The lounge may, at first, seem small but it's actually spacious divided by a small hallway. Drinks are excellent with many options especially during cocktail hours. Also has a nice selection of premium teas. I heard that they will be renovating it by January so it can only improve from thereon.Breakfast: Since we had lounge access, we had three breakfast options. First at the lounge, second at the full buffet at Marble Lounge on the ground floor, and third at Junisoh Japanese restaurant at the 2nd floor. We tried them all during our five days of stay. The lounge has good enough option and it's definitely less crowded than the Marble Lounge--but the Marble Lounge has more options. Junisoh breakfast is a must try for those wanting to learn a little bit about the Japanese Diet Philosophy of eating only up to 80%. It's a bento box style that's best enjoyed slowly and with great relish.Service: Service was topnotch. During our last two nights, which fell on a weekend, the lounge during cocktail hours was quite crowded but they managed to seat everyone at a reasonable time. They were also helpful in providing us maps, directions, and the Concierge let us borrow an umbrella during one day when it rained.Getting Around: There is a shuttle going to and from Shinjuku station every 20 minutes so it's not a hassle. Also, it's actually quite walkable to Shinjuku station, excellent during cool weather, as it gives you a chance to admire the tall magnificent buildings in Shinjuku.Lastly, kudos to whoever is managing the Hilton Tokyo Instagram account for being interactive and funny! :-)All in all, an excellent hotel in Tokyo right in Shinjuku. Will definitely stay again when I'm in Tokyo.","Louisville, Kentucky","danielzky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",140,5.0

Both in the same both,so Im speaking generally for both stays, just different rooms.Check inThe moment you enter the hotel, there is a sweet smell all over the place in the lobby. The lobby its very big and there was a lot of managers doing check in, so we didn't wait. RoomsSuperior roomWe were 3 persons sleeping in different beds, so it was a bit crampy. We used the hotel only for sleep and shower, since we went sightseeing all day. It wasn't that bad, but still, expensive for the room we get. Amenities in the room included coffee (nescafe was a great one) and tea. No cream, so we bought our own.Upgraded to executive suite for 2nd stay.This room was a way more big that the superior room,only downsided, was that it meant to be for the 2 queen beds, and has amenities like a big sofa with huge coffee table in the middle. I imagine it would be very nice if we only had that 2 beds, but we asked for a 3rd bed and the layout was super weird. We were moving all the room to see the best fit for our little 2 night stay.Amenities in the room included a fancy nespresso coffee machine, plus the amenities from the superior room.BedsThis is one of the best rollaway beds I had in an hotel.It was super comfortable!Breakfast buffetOne day we had the prix fix menu at the marble lounge. It was super good portioned. It included cereal, fruit, pastries, yogurth, juice, coffee or tea etc. I didn't finished the whole thing.Another day, had the breakfast buffet at same location, but choose the buffet. It was so good. With oriental and occidental choices. I personally loved the skinny french toast, was amazing!Shuttle serviceSuper punctual, fast and efficient.Business centerThere was 2 macs and 2 windows pc. One of the macs was very slow and the windows one was out or order.Concierge serviceThey were very helpful. From lent us an adaptor,to had several baggage taken care of for 9 days until our return to the hotel. They also provided timetables and reservations for the airport limousine between other stuff.The areaAs others says, this is not the Shinjuku area you see on tv. Its a little far away from it, but for that you have the shuttle service.We found the area good to stay, since it was very peaceful and had a super market open 24 hrs. just 2 blocks away.Also, had several cafes around and a Dennys restaurant.There is a park almost in front of the hotel (Central park Shinjuku) which was small but lovely. I had a run over there and there were other people doing so. Overall, I had a good stay here.

On a positive note the bed was really comfortable! The breakfast was good but was extremely busy. Reception staff had limited to no English so when we asked where to transfer our pre paid voucher into a JR pass we were given another map with railway stations marked. After a day of going from station to station ticket officer to ticket office we were extremely confused and exhausted. The front desk staff were off hand and showed no interest. I think they should get assistance from someone who can speak a little English to help. Finally we approached a gentleman who was the only staff member who understood what we were talking about and along with a very helpful man from concierge went out of their way to help us find the correct location. The hotel is a long way from restaurants so therefore you have to use the hotel facilities and pay exhorbitant fees of around 24% in taxes in service fees and consumption on top of very high prices in food. The Zetta bar was the same having staff with limited English and Off hand and not friendly. . If you pay such high rates you expect service and a pleasant evening but not so at this Hilton.

It was definitely a good place to end the trip. Though it wasn't the most luxurious of the hotels we'd stayed in, it certainly lived up to the Hilton name. We'd arrived at the hotel early and were pretty sure we weren't going to get a room right away, but they got us a room immediately, which was great because it allowed us to rest for a little bit before exploring Shinjuku.The hotel itself is in a great location, close to all sorts of awesome sights, places to shop, and restaurants. You really can't beat the location! The room was a good size considering it was in Tokyo and the bathroom was very nice and clean. The breakfast was very nice, with a good selection of different kinds of food, though it's very clear it caters to a western clientele. The entire hotel is very obviously catering to westerners and has an American feel to it, which is I suppose to be expected considering it's a Hilton. That being said, we had dinner at the japanese restaurant on our last night and it was one of the best meals of our trip. They even had wagyu beef, which my boyfriend absolutely loved. I'm a pescatarian so I stuck to the set meal with sushi in it. Though I did notice that I had told the server I didn't eat meat and yet the appetizer served to me had chicken in it. I suspect this was more my bad for not being more specific, though- maybe she thought I meant only red meat. The appetizer was such a small part of the meal though, I just gave it to my boyfriend and happily ate the rest of my food, no problem. It was also very helpful that the hotel offers a shuttle service to the airports. It isn't free and I believe it's more expensive than taking the train there, but in my opinion it was worth it for the convenience of it. That way we didn't need to worry about taking the trains with all our luggage, or any uncertainty about timing, since they knew exactly what length of time it'd take to get there (it's about two hours). All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much! The service was excellent and all the staff were so cheerful and helpful.

It was a reward stay and I paid points for four nights and received the fifth night free. So this was a great value to me. As a Hilton Gold member, I did not receive Exec Lounge access, but I was not expecting that.I did receive a wonderful room upgrade to a king bed. The room was large, high up with a wonderful view and a huge bathroom with a walk in shower. The AC was strong and quiet, there was a chair and a desk and also a chair/ottoman set up. Plugs by the bed and the desk area. Housekeeping was done so well during my 5 days stay. Everything was replaced, replenished, cleaned, etc. It was spotless every day. I had a kettle in my room and coffee/tea set. There was a minibar with a little room for snacks that I would buy at the convenient store in the basement.Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was really well done. I found the food delicious, lots of choices, and it never got too crowded. I would be there around 7. Lobby is busy but the staff is very helpful. I used the luggage forwarding service in the lobby to have my bags sent on to the next hotel. This is VERY USEFUL when you are traveling in Japan by public transit as your bag is in your next hotel room when you check in. I think the fee was around $10 for one bag to Yokohama. It was charged to the room. Very well done and worth it. Even though I found the transit station near the hotel very convenient, I would often take the shuttle to Shinjuku station since there are so many great eating places near the station. This was a great stay. It is a large busy hotel, and, while the service was excellent, its too big to be very personal, and that is just fine for me and appropriate in a place like Tokyo. The price was right for me, as I was paying with points, but the rates were high when I stayed there. But that is for a world class city hotel in a city known for high priced hotels.

This Hilton was good but it wasn’t great. The not great: This is in the business location of Shinjuku and it’s a 20+ minute walk to the other side of Shinjuku and there isn’t very much in the area. We did find a Starbucks, a 7-11, Denny’s and a convenience store all within a block of the hotel but otherwise it’s very sparse.There is not a hang out area in the lobby. There are a couple of seats but there is no where to sit and wait or kill time in the lobby area. If we were waiting for a tour guide or just each other we would have to stand in the lobby as all the seats about 10 of them total were always taken.The bathroom is a hot mess. Yes it’s Tokyo yes it’s small but the real issue here is that there is no glass enclosure or curtain for the shower and so you get water everywhere on on everything since it’s such a tight space. We were not told about the free shuttle to Shinjuku Station and can I tell you this would have been life changing for us. I saw it out front on our last day and had to inquire about it. Luckily we were able to use it to get our luggage to the station. I wish upon check in or in the paperwork they sent be upon booking they would have let us know about it. It would have made getting to the hotel so so much easier.Any noise from the hallways can be heard in your room so anyone walking Dow the hall talking can be disturbing.There are no electrical outlets near the nightstands to charge your phones. I like to use my phone before bed and just charge it up and leave it next to me but I had to always get up and go put it up. I use my phone as an alarm so it was always on the other side in the mornings so no snooze button for me. The good:The room was very nice size, the bed was comfortable the room was clean and the view was beautiful. We stayed on the 26th floor. The A/C was quiet and worked wonderfully the room was also dark and easy to sleep in. The bar on the 2nd floor was also lovely we spend some time there on the first night. Spacious great music and service. There is a convenience store in the mall in the basement of the hotel.

Worth noting that I’m a Hilton diamond member.Location: off the red line, there is direct access via the under ground passage ways if you head towards the Tokyo metropolitian government building / Hiltopia, it might not be that easy to find first time. I went over ground the first time, then left the hotel via the underground afterwards. I thought the location was fairly central but to be fair there didn’t seem to be a lot to do immediately around the hotel (except the observation deck in the government building). But you are only one station from Shinjuku so not really a problem. Plus I love the hotel so much that I can overlook this. Room: best upgrade I have ever got, junior suite. It was huge, and lovely. Even thou I’m not that noise sensitive I was worried that I was right by the elevator. I’m pretty sure I heard noise like once, which is pretty amazing. I think the blinds/shutters must be noise blocking too, as despite being next to a hospital I only heard an ambulance once! I was on the 16th floor. The air con made a tiny noise that I notice sometimes but only because the room was so quiet! The elevators were pretty quick. The sofa was comfortable, as was the bed. The toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn. I enjoyed having a tea set in the room. The shower pressure was excellent, but I found the bath in the wet room set up a little odd, and it look me a while to find a good angle for the shower head so that I wasn’t backed into the bath. It also made the bathroom a little smaller than it could have been. I find having a moving shutter outside the bathroom a bit odd, if you were sharing the room with someone then you need to trust they don’t open it whilst you are showering. I also assume they can see a shadow of you in the shower?Lounge access: I got that via my status. I tried afternoon tea - excellent lots of choices of cakes, all western. Also tried pre dinner snacks, you could probably make a meal out of it. I don’t drink but saw wine and spirit.Breakfast: Free with status, I didn’t try the Japanese breakfast which needs booking in advance. The marble lounge breakfast buffet was amazing, western and Asian option, especially love that they offer soya milk, I saw soya smoothie too but did not try it.I had minimal interaction with staff, I was granted late checkout (my request 2pm) but did not use it in the end.If I had to nit pick:- the lobby always seems busy. I waited a bit at checkin, no real waiting at check out. - I really don’t like that the clean towels are stored right next to the toilet paper holder, doesn’t seem very hygienic to me.If you have right Hilton status, the perks are really great here, I would definitely recommend staying.

The reviews were glowing, but we were so terribly disappointed--this was most definitely not a 5-star hotel, and I'm not even sure what measures were used to rate it as such. The hotel itself is just a hotel, very average, nothing special or distinctive. Our room had a beautiful view of the city, but the room itself was not particularly nice. We only had one other Tokyo hotel experience (The Palace, which is truly 5 stars), and it just did not measure up on any level. The room was fairly small with an outdated and small bathroom, with a minimum number of towels provided, only instant coffee with paper cups, no special amenities whatsoever-whatsoever! We also had the breakfast buffet one morning. The food was okay, but it was a total mob scene and minimal, although friendly, service (we had to specifically ask to have our table cleared). Our one interaction with the concierge, when we were on our way out for lunch and asked for sushi recommendations. We were sent to 2 different places, one which was closed and being remodeled and the other which required reservations. There was no offer to make reservations, something that really should have been offered or mentioned. I could go on how the rooms were uninspired, had no turn-down service, robes and zero special amenities or that there were no cloth napkins used during breakfast, and I say all this not to sound like a snob, but so that there are real expectations of what you're getting and what you're not getting, which are things that you typically expect from a 5-star hotel. Yes, the people who work here are friendly and helpful and the bed was comfortable. They also provide a shuttle to the station, which was a nice perk, but I wish the hotel was billed more in line with what it is.

There isn’t very much in the immediate vicinity and Shinjuku is a good 20-25 minutes. Would recommend for those looking for larger rooms in Tokyo, but not necessarily for the proximity to major areas to visit.

Well that’s missing from this hotel. It is an average average hotel. I had specially booked a room with a king bed, and on check in I was told that I had a room with a king bed. Well after waiting for a long time for a check in, as you’ve to line up for it. Its literally a noisy, loud fish market in the lobby. You have to find your way through the people to get to reception (with your bags, no they don’t have anyone taking your bags off you). Then after the check in we get to our room, and there are two single beds. On calling the reception, we are told apologetically that they will send someone to “join the two beds together”. Well, we could do that ourselves, if we had asked for a king bed then we should get a king bed, not two single beds joined together. The bedroom itself was big considering TOKYO standards. The carpet is plush but old. The beds themselves were ok but the pillows lacked memory foam. The air conditioner worked ok but I couldn’t find a remote to control it. The TV had mostly Asian channels with just a couple in English. The bathroom itself was pretty average. It was small considering the size of the room. The shower is in the bath and not separate, with a very flimsy screen, that whenever we used it the water would splat from our body and it made the floor wet. Did not like it, so called up the reception again. No resolution was offered. We had to make do every time by mopping up the floor with the bath towels. There were no bath robes provided in the room. On request we got them the next day. We went to the pool and gym to take a look, and the staff member there told us that we will have to remove our shoes to go in there?? We were only taking a look and not dipping our feet with our shoes on!!On the last day we requested that we be given an extra hour for check out as we had a late flight. They said we could get only half an hour. Well, so we planned accordingly and were about to step out, then we were told that the room was required so only “15 minutes” were possible. So we didn’t go anywhere, as we had the housekeeping supervisor standing outside, knocking on the door, hurrying us to leave. We rushed out, lined up for our check out and that was that!!YEAH, SO I DONT THIINK WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE HILTON IN A HURRY!!","Melbourne, Australia","kingtuteja</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",45,1.0

Arrival / check in - Once arrived, we were greeted by the staff and our bags were held until check in was complete. We were checked in by Ernesto who was simply amazing and has a great personality. He didn't just check us in and move onto the next person. Ernesto recognised my Hilton Honors Diamond Status and did his best to upgrade us though the lobby and the hotel seemed extremely busy. He was able to work his magic and upgraded us to the 37th floor though the room wasn't ready so he went above and beyond and gave us a temporary sleep room for a few hours. We felt extremely well looked after and could tell he did his best to accommodate us. Location - Located in the business district of Shinjuku , this hotel is situated near a train station metres away and offers a free shuttle 3 times per hour to the main Shinjuku entrance. Room - We were upgraded to a king suite on the 37th floor (due to Diamond status) . The suite size is more than enough for 2 people, with 2 bathrooms and a make up room, massive amounts of luggage storage , 2 toilets, a lounge area and a MASSIVE bed! Water pressure is adequate and pillow selection is fantastic. Housekeeping have done an amazing job, extremely thorough and more than enough high quality amenities. Executive Lounge - My status allowed lounge access which has been very handy though the lounge can get very busy in the mornings and at evenings though is a real first world problem. Staff are very accommodating in these busy periods. Food on offer is wide range of hot and cold dishes ( depending of time of day) . Lots of non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks available though if I can suggest something, it's to upgrade the coffee machines as they aren't great and are super noisy. Note - This Hotel doesn't have a welcome pack for Diamond Members though we have been offered 2 x free drinks at their cocktail lounge which is more than sufficient. The hotel also offer well priced airport transfers which to be honest, is worth taking instead of battling with the trains. Breakfast - The buffet breakfast can get very busy but the staff work extremely quickly to turnover tables to ensure you are seated as fast as possible. A great wide range of food accommodating to various cultures ; salad bar, cold meats, asian delicacies , western food and all in between.Overall our stay so far has been memorable. A big thank you to the Ernesto and the staff here who have made our stay an experience we won't forget.Should we return to Tokyo , there is only one place we will stay and that's at the Hilton.","Melbourne, Australia","Dennis M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",311,5.0

Trust me they weren’t rare vintages or varieties . The upshot is that no discount was given for serving ourselves and the bottles were charged on a per glass basis on what the bottle held. Yep that’s a rip off. Cost $1500 plusSecond instant involved some friends at the bar who ordered two whiskies and 4 beers.

From pre-arrival questions to baggage handling, you can depend on them.The location is pretty convenient. The closest Metro station is Nishi (West) Shijuku (M07) followed by Tochōmae (In front of Tokyo Metro Government) Station (E28). Both are connected by underground tunnel (just turn different ways when you enter the tunnel). If you need to find your way in the Tokyo Metro System, I find it is easiest to go by the station numbers. This way, you can quickly find ways to transfer and calculate the number of stops. The E line is sort of a loop (shaped like a sideways 6 or 9) so you can go to a lot of places on it once you realize the case. Tochōmae is actually where the loop splits and trains go essentially 3 different directions from there.The hotel offers a shuttle to the Shinjuku station and it is a 15-20 minute walk if you don't get lost. The Tokyo Metro Government is 2 blocks away and has a free observatory on the 45th(?) floor that opens well into the evening.Tried breakfast at the Lounge, downstairs restaurant and the Japanese breakfast.

A week before our stay we received an email from Hilton with a “special offer” offering an upgrade to an Executive King Room for JPY 12,204 or an Executive King Jr. Suite Room for JPY 18,306. We kindly declined the offer. We were able to communicate with the concierges indicating that it was a very special stay (birthdays and the beginning of a pilgrimage) and they kindly left a card, balloons and small box of chocolates & madeleines in the room, very nice. We got to the hotel early in the morning and knew that early check in was going to be difficult but they processed everything so that we just needed to come back after 3pm to retrieve the keys, we left our bags and went sightseeing. During check in we were offered again an upgrade for JPY 10,000. I appreciated the offer but was honestly surprised as of how many times the hotel was offering these upgrades, perhaps it was because we reserved the room with points (?). I have stayed in Hilton hotels all over the world but never experience this constant offering, in fact, other Hilton properties we just received a free upgrade (which we never asked for by the way). The staff was very polite, the hotel huge and the lobby area quite busy. Our room was in the 20th floor and had a city view, this wasn’t a renovated room, but it was huge for Japan standards; it was just OK, nothing to talk about; we stayed in over 8 hotels during our Japan trip and all of them, including guest houses and temples, offered free internet and yukatas, not the Hilton. I know, this is not the end of the world but it gives you a perspective, basically you need to pay way more to have access to things that other smaller establishments provide to every single person that stay in their properties. The shuttle from Shinjuku was very convenient but walking to the station was not bad at all. Location is OK and very close to the Metropolitan Government, but the “heart” of Shinjuku is like 10-15 minutes away.

Since I was a returning guest, something took a toll when they gave me a room with no space to walk because the armchair was blocking one of the side of the bed (the right side) so the person that came with me can't go anywhere, but their response was fast regarding this problem and they change the room that seconds.

Beds were comfortable, and rooms maintained well from one day to the next by the housekeeping staff. Pool and gym were also good. We had one meal in the hotel at the slightly pricey teppanyaki, but in return for spending almost USD700 got an absolutely outstanding meal.The location is not the best as it is too far to walk to Shinjuku station and surrounds with the kids (the hotel recognises this by having a shuttle bus that goes between the station and hotel every twenty minutes or so). There is nothing wrong with the hotel, but with young kids you might be better served staying closer to Shinjuku station itself, or perhaps even in the entertainment district proper if you prefer.

I fully stand behind my previous review but I feel like a few things need to be added.First of all, when I say that I have stayed at this hotel over one hundred times, that is no exaggeration. I began staying at this hotel when it first opened in the 1980s and I have continued to stay here ever since.For the first couple of decades of this hotel's existence, very little changed. In recent years, however, they have launched a redesign and upgrade campaign. The thing about change is, however, it does not always make things better it simply makes things different. And, I believe this is the case with this hotel. Yes, their restaurants and their cocktail lounge have moved and changed a bit but have they really become better? I don't really think so.In terms of the rooms, they have re-designed the interior space. What they have done, in terms of design, is that they have placed new furnishings in the rooms that are somewhat reminiscent of 1980s high-tech furniture. For example, at my most recent stay I had a desk in my room that had a glass top and very extended chrome legs. I cannot tell you how many times my wife and I stubbed our toe's on those legs because they are sticking out so far into the main area of the room. I actually thought of posting a photo of my bruised foot, due to this table, but I thought that would be in poor taste. But, they should really rethink this furnishing pattern because it is actually very dangerous. I am certain I am not the only person to have stubbed my toes on these extended legs.Another problem I find is that they have redesigned their bath/shower areas. They have installed these very limited shifting glass pieces that do not extend the entire length of the tub. I have seen the same glass pieces installed at other Hiltons and I always question why. They are just not very functional. Moreover, if you hope to take a shower with your partner, it becomes virtually impossible because water sprays all over everything. Again, this is a new design that I believe they should really rethink.In terms of actual hotel service, I did have a problem on my most recent stay. I return to my room at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon and the maid service had still not cleaned my room. I walked in, and I was in a literal disbelief. I was forced to call to actually have my room cleaned. For a hotel of this caliber, this kind of poor service should just not exist. Then, I had to go down to the cocktail lounge and have a drink while I waiting for my room to be clean. Simply unacceptable!One of the other problems I find is that, in times gone past when you needed to do currency exchange, you would go up to the main desk and there they had a section of their main reception area dedicated to currency exchange. An actual person would exchange your money for you. Now, you go and stick your money in a machine over to the side of the lobby. This is just way too impersonal of an experience for a Hilton of this caliber to offer. It is simply lazy. The entire reason that one stays at the Hilton is so that they can have personal encounters with the staff if and when needed. Thus, in my opinion, this was just a bad business decision to make money exchange via machine the only option.Overall, I still love this hotel. A few things to keep in mind, however.

While searching for great deals it was clear that this going to be an expensive trip, so we just said to ourselves why not make it a trip of lifetime, we are spending money anyway. A brief research on tripadvisor we figured out Shinjuku was the best bet to stay in Tokyo. We always like to stay at international chains because they generally dont go terribly wrong as their reputation is at stake. In many options I zeroed in on Hilton Tokyo and boy I was too damn right. Things were perfect as soon as we stepped into Hotel. A very friendly lady helped us out with our luggage and escorted us to checkin area. Again a very friend person at counter helped us he even accepted my request of higher floor. They helped us with luggage to our room. The rooms was very spacious and very well arranged. Beds were very comfortable, bathroom spanking clean, they had slippers, bath robes, all the amenities including shaving kit, toothbrushes, night gowns, and so on. Best yet, since we got the executive floor they have light snacks every evening and great breakfast in the morning. The breakfast host was amazingly friendly with bringing made to order omelette or coffee or orange juice at your table, talking and explaining things in a very friendly manner. I can go on and on, made our stay in Tokyo very pleasurable and indeed making it a trip of a lifetime.Location wise this Hotel is perfect, has subway line right below in basement Marunochi line which takes you to Tokyo and Shinjuku and E line.

The newly renovated rooms have a bizarre shower / tub setup that creates lots of space for mold growth. Once I brought it to managements attention, they were quick to move us into a room without the new bathroom, solving our issue. One of the things I appreciate most is that the hotel’s GM really made me feel like he took our problem seriously and wanted to make it right. Often, hotel staff will respond with suspicion to guest complaints about room issues, but not this time. As per my previous experiences, food was excellent and the hotel was very clean.

We could not have chosen a better hotel and I wish I could pack it in my bag and take it with us. The hotel is along the Airport Limo route which makes it an easy transition from any airport. They have a separate executive lounge area where you can check in instead of having to stand in line at the desk. We arrived very early in the morning and were able to get checked into our room right away. The staff was super friendly the entire time we were in the lounge and made sure we were comfortable while we waited.We had an executive tower suite and the room was gorgeous. The view from the 35th floor is perfect and I would suggest requesting a high floor when possible. The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom is quite fancy. The Toto toilet took a little getting used to, but now I want one in our house back in the states. My only complaint would be the lights in the bathroom are all on one switch, which means if you go to the bathroom in the dark, there isn’t a way to do so without turning on all the lights.our favorite part of our room was the view we got of Mt. Fuji a few times during our stay.The executive lounge takes up most of the 37th floor and is quite comfortable. There is also a separate lounge they open for elite members during the cocktail hours. The staff is super friendly, they all speak English and are able to guide you about local attractions and food options. The spreads at each of the events we went to was tasty, fresh and well prepared. We took advantage of the shuttle to the train station a couple of times and it made for an easy journey any time that we wanted to explore Tokyo. Overall, great hotel.

I am writing this review in all sincerity and based on my personal experience. Since I don’t have much time writing, I will break my points into three aspect. I hope that someone planning to visit this part of the world will find it informative when deciding on the choice of hotel. First and foremost is the location, the hotel is rightly located at the major hub of Tokyo and 5-10min walk to one of the major Metro line. Truly, if you are looking for convenience and plan to get around as often as possible, you must stay at this hotel because of its great proximity. They have a shuttle bus to the station, but I recommend that you walk especially if you are visiting for the first time. I find it very interesting to walk around. Also the city is very safe, and general Japanese people are nice in case you ever get lost. Secondly, the service, without a doubt I will give the hotel 5* star plus plus for an exceptional service. I mean how else can someone have a memorable stay in a busy city without choosing the right place to stay?! I have stayed in many luxury hotels and I can tell you that the service at Hilton Tokyo is top notch. The staffs are very helpful, they always go out of their way to assist immediately. Whenever, I call the room service for something to be deliver to my room, I receive knock on my door literally within 2-5minutes. Also, the check-in & check-out process is spot on. I have strong opinion that the front office is the first impression of any hotel, and Hilton Tokyo nailed it. No long queue (despite the fact that it’s a busy hotel), all the staffs speak fluent English, and the employees are very welcoming. Oh, I must comment on their overall uniform, its very presentable, suitable color for each departments and the staffs are well dressed ( e.g, I have noticed that the female staff have nice clean nails).I must also applaud the concierge team, I don’t want to mention names here because it will not be fair to others as I believe they all work similarly. Seriously these guys/ladies are very knowledgeable about directions around the city and beyond. They can also assist you to plan your stay, where to visit around the city and outside etc. Believe it or not, they provide accurate direction and information that any help desk around the Metro stations. Moving forward, the food and beverage department. Please bear in mind that when I mentioned F&B, I am referring to all the departments within in general, that is, the restaurants, executive lounge, bars and breakfast. Let start with the breakfast, Wow! what a great selections of food, from healthy meal to Japanese, and western cuisines. Their breakfast is tailored to everyone from all walk of life, they also have several life cooking stations, 100% Freshly squeezes juices (I love the kale), infusion water, soya milk for people with diary allergy and name it all, you will certain find it there. If you like to experience Japanese cuisine exclusively for your breakfast, you can reserve a table before 9pm (please find out the eligibility). I love Zatta bar most especially because its very contemporary and the great selections of music entertainment. I love the fact that they switch different singers at least twice a week. The ambience is also very nice, and never overcrowded because of the space and design. The staffs are excellent and very professional. Florian is a great host and asset to the Bar (I think is very relaxing and home feel when one can chat with the staffs at any bar while sipping drink). The Executive lounge is another great part of the hotel because it’s very relaxing, very exclusive and don’t forget to carry your camera with you, you might be lucky to capture the view of majesty Mt. Fuji from there, and intact the overall city view. You can be rest assured that Waki will always keep you entertained while at lounge (amazing host)Finally, they have great numbers of restaurants to dine and wine (make sure to book ahead or immediately you arrive at the hotel because it’s always busy). I love the overall designs of the restaurants; very exquisite. ","Hatta, United Arab Emirates","feyio575</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hatta, United Arab Emirates</strong>",1,5.0

Be careful if you do not book directly with them as you might be second class! Other than this! We were asked to be an Hilton Honor member so we can have free WiFi which is norm for most hotels worldwide but after filling in the forms we are told again because we didn’t book directly and we cannot be extended the free WiFi. Second class again! So why ask us to be when they know we cannot get it???? Maybe because they all have a quota to achieve so they use the same technique to achieve it. Felt very cheated! Hotel otherwise is ok! Staff are like robots maybe because of the standards set out to be achieve! Nonetheless in the industry of hospitality I feel they need to treat everyone the same. Location is not bad rooms are also good size for Tokyo standard. Just don’t be robots but look after everyone the same as all of us pay the same only through different channels booked which the hotel makes the call to sell the rooms!!!!

This Italian restaurant ( Ristorante Carriera Italiana) is super friendly, not quite as good with their English, but has the most amazing quality and flavour in each dish we had.

Although we enjoyed our stay here, I definitely do not consider this to be a 5-star hotel, or even a 4-star hotel, as some online travel sources suggest. The standard guests rooms are small (not unusual by Tokyo standards) and quite dated - the bathrooms in particular. Our bathroom was quite small and sad with none of the details that elevate a hotel into luxury status. Our tub/shower had one of those partial tub doors where the water splashes out when you take a shower. The bathrooms could definitely use a face-lift. That said, we still had a very nice stay here, due in large part, to Japan's elevated service standards. The hotel staff was quite gracious and helpful. The breakfast buffet is quite good, with a broad range of fresh fruit and juices, Japanese breakfast, omelette station, and freshly baked pastries. The hotel is located in a quieter part of Tokyo but just a few blocks from several metro stations and the lively areas of Shinjuku.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Cecilia O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",12,4.0

On one level, this was the least attractive. Our upgraded room, while comfortable enough, was smaller than any of the the others but that is probably to be expected in Tokyo. The lobby is often crowded with groups and has almost no places to sit. Indeed, when our room was cleaned -- usually in mid-afternoon -- we were hard pressed to find a comfortable place to wait. The lounge areas on floors 3-4, where the meeting rooms are, were roped off (we had to ignore the robes, I confess). But, on the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located in Shinjuku -- not a bad walk to Shinjuku station (it did take us three days to figure out where the hotel's shuttle bus stopped there) and connected via underground passageways to the subway. This is an upscale part of town, but also close to a wide variety of restaurants and shopping. The most attractive feature of the hotel is its excellent breakfast buffet.","Bonita Springs, Florida","arkcruiser</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bonita Springs, Florida</strong>",45,4.0

Hilton doesn’t position itself as 5-star; it is a 4-star brand (in the Hilton group, only the Waldorf-Astoria, makes 5-star, and barely, like Ritz-Carlton or Sofitel - and clearly below the luxury standards (or pricing!) of Four Seasons, Shangri-La, Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula, Aman, etc). The property is 4-star through and through: kitschy lobby which, at times, is almost as crowded as a train station; no security when entering lifts (although Japan is a low-crime country); extremely dated furniture in rooms (the rooms’ design is thoughtful and efficient, though); minuscule bathrooms with basic amenities; insufficient noise insulation when you have rowdy nocturnal neighbours; winding queues for buffets (even for the Happy Hour at the Executive Lounge). However, it is well located in Shinjuku: convenient limousine bus from/to Haneda and Narita airports, atop a metro station served by two lines. The gym, swimming pool, and hot bath are small for the property, but clean and adequate; they even have two rooftop tennis courts. WiFi (free for HH members) is fast when it works. Most importantly, service is friendly and excellent throughout the hotel, from reception, to concierge, housekeeping, gym, restaurants, room service, executive lounge - a sign of an exemplary customer-oriented corporate culture.

At the moment of booking i have emailed the room reservations team/conceirge to request for rooms on a high floor with views and all 3 rooms to be on the same floor.I have repeated the request via email about 2 weeks ago once again after attaining hilton diamond status.This process of requesting room allocation was repeated again 1 and 2 days prior to our stay in hilton tokyo.I clearly remember emails being sent to my email account every single day prior to checking into the hotel about paying for upgrades to the next category room.From the hilton hotel app I was able to check in to rooms on the 37th floor the day before. I emailed the reservation team regarding the situation and did not check in as we were on a family trip and needed rooms on the same floor.Upon checkin our request that dated more than 6 months ago were unable to acceded to. We were given 2 rooms on 24th floor and 1 room on the 23rd.The 23rd floor room was directly facing someones office and the office staff could even look at me and wave to us. I am not sure if this is the ""room with view"" or ""highfloor"" that is as our request.I subsequently called frontdesk to get a better room but was told room is at 100pct occupancy, first offered a same room view 4 floor above us followed by a 31st floor room 3129. With the exact same kind of view.I am not sure if i deserved less as a hilton diamond member but i do remember checking into the room 3129 (after shifting from room 2329) seeing gifts and mineral water prepare in the room with a card welcoming a european named couple. I am not sure if it was 100pct occupancy what made our request less a ""priority"" than others. Not to mention diamond members were suppose to get room upgrades with preferred view. We came from intercontinental osaka and were upgraded to executive suite upon arrival despite a full occupancy.We were only given a change of room at 830pm after writing in to the gm.There is almost 0 staff available except for a lady at the hotel entrance to help with the luggage. Imagine the taxis , private cars and the airport shuttle coming in and only 1 small sized lady to help with luggages despite the rain? After shifting our luggage ourselves to the hotel lobby, no porters was keen to help even looking at us hands all filled with luggages and bags with a baby stroller, we had to call 1 porter on our own. (Speak about initiative from a 5 star hotel)The shuttle to the shinjuku station was horrendous, filled with office ladies that obviously do not seem to stay at the hotel. No verification was needed to board the bus and so the bus is filled leaving the hotel guest at a disadvantage.Hotel buffet breakfast at marble lounge starts at 6am, when we went down at 625, the entire cooked food section was empty and not ready. Only breads and pancakes were displayed.Dined in at dynasty hotel and food was extremely slow, we had to asked numerous time before a fish was served more than 45mins after ordering leaving our toddler wailing as she was hungry.The hotel manager which replied to our email *samuel peter, was MIA and it seemed no communication was done with the exex lounge staff to inform them of our change of rooms when we returned at 8pm. Subsequently, no efforts to reply our emails after we checkedout of the hotel. Only gived this review a 2 star instead of 1 because of a staff at the exec lounge (didnt get his name but he mentioned he was chi/kor/jap mixed and from hawaii) who was very friendly and helped us with the change of rooms making our stay a little more pleasant after the terrible start at the hotel.",,158jiajunt,30,2.0

We stayed for 5 nights on points and in a room facing the city.By far the best part of the experience was my interactions with the hotel concierge team prior to our arrival. I needed some assistance with fine dining options in Tokyo and the team were able to both recommend and secure reservations for us at some of the best restaurants in the city.The front desk check-in experience was also top notch, as while they weren't able to offer me a complimentary upgrade per my status, they did provide a number of extra amenities to make up for the inconvenience.Everything else was not so 5-star.The rooms, while comfortable, did feel a bit dated. There's the option of city view vs park view and there's really not much of a difference as I've had different views in two separate stays and hadn't had a preference.Even though the hotel has 5 elevators, it seems they only keep one or two running at any time. One night we arrived back around 11pm on a week night and there was a huge queue for the elevators for some weird reason.Breakfast is similarly very crowded. There was always a line no matter what time it was in the morning and just trying to get food from the buffet could become chaotic with people all over the place. Even though we had breakfast included in our stay, we didn't even go down the final few days because of the crowds and the repetitiveness in the food.The hotel has direct access to an underground tunnel system that takes you to two different subway stations so that was fairly convenient for travel. However, getting there from Shinjuku station is a bit far, so if you have bags, I recommend getting them shipped to the hotel from either the airport or from your previous hotel in Japan.It's not a bad place to stay overall, but I would certainly be shopping around a bit more on our next visit to Tokyo.","Boston, Massachusetts","gte371z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",19,4.0

I did a lot of research before deciding on Hilton Nishishinjuku because this hotel seems to be generous to gold member according to most Trip Advisor members. However, that was not the case with me. The limousine bus took two and a half hours to reach Hilton from the airport due to Shinjuku traffic. I begin to doubt if I made the right decision when I was stuck in traffic and when I got to the hotel, they told me they are fully booked and cannot offer more to a gold member. They did offer an upgrade on our 3rd night that we accepted. We were then assign to room 3005. The room was clean and of decent size. However, the bathtub door only covers 40% of the tub. What normally is a relaxing moment for me has became stressful as I tried to move my body and maneuver the shower head to try to avoid water leaking out the tub. The first three days of my stay, there were a lot of people so elevators were very slow and jam packed regardless if I was going up or going down. It stopped at almost every other floors. I would advise management to look into the possibility of assigning express elevators. On our last day, we waited for our shuttle at the lobby. We tried to find a seat but the 10 seats were all occupied. We witnessed an elderly lady with her daughter trying to find a seat but none were available so they proceed to walk to the concierge area and stood there to wait for their son/brother to pick them up. When we spotted a vacant seat, I went ahead and took it while my husband went over to retrieve the lady so she can sit down. I think it is unreasonable for a hotel this size to only have 10 seats in the lobby area. Tourist are tired people, it would be nice that there are more seats available. The hotel is about 7 minutes walk to the Oedo line or Marunouchi Line. If you plan to take the subway quite a bit, you may want to consider purchasing a Tokyo Subway Ticket from concierge.

Familiar brand. Great overall experience. Took the limo bus from Haneda and was at the front door of the Hilton in 45 minutes. Got to the hotel at 6:30am and was able to get early check-in for ¥7k which reasonable and very very handy. Great location, about 10-15 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku and right above Nishi-Shinjuku and Tochomae stations. You can pretty much get to any corner of Tokyo from here within 45 minutes on the subway, and some great places like the Tsukiji Fish Market are on these lines so really easy to get to. Basic King room (2621 - view from room in photo) was very comfortable and super clean. My only negative on the room was that (n.b. first world problem and not really “room” related) the selection of TV channels for a non-Japanese speaker was very poor. Basically you can’t watch TV in English unless it’s CNN or Discovery, and forget about any European languages. I like to watch for a while at night before falling asleep so it was slightly annoying on a personal level.Breakfast was great. Can get quite busy at 9am but good an hour before or after. Terrific selection, and if something was not on display you just ask for it and the staff went out of their way to get it. Generally the staff were great, and especially the Concierge were very helpful, knowledgeable and all multi-lingual.So overall a terrific hotel experience and good value.

As a diamond member, I was upgraded from a standard room to a premium room, and received access to the executive lounge as well as one complimentary cocktail at the bar downstairs. I thought the service at this hotel was excellent (of course this typically occurs in Japan), the hotel room was in very good shape, and everything worked properly. The executive lounge offers nice alcoholic beverages and snacks in the evening, a limited but lovely breakfast in the morning, and a pleasant atmosphere with attentive staff all day. Everyone at the hotel spoke fluent English. I was also offered the option of the breakfast buffet at the restaurant downstairs, and it was an elaborate breakfast with extensive choices.I have read some criticisms of this hotel, around location, standard of the rooms and service, but personally, I found everything to be of a high standard.There is one issue with the extent of Diamond recognition, that has been raised in the past. In my experience, with most hotel chains in Japan, one will receive the level of recognition that is exactly specified in the membership programme but typically, no more than that. That was indeed the case at this hotel and so I do not see this as a problem at the Hilton in Tokyo. Of course, it would have been nice to have received a big upgrade to a capacious suite with sweeping views of the city, but the diamond membership level entitles one to a preferred room or suite subject to availability (and technically if a room is available that represents an upgrade from what you have booked, there is no specific obligation to give you a suite). In some other countries like Thailand, quite often huge upgrades are given to diamond members, but this is not typically done in Japan, in my experience. (and I have experience with numerous chains) Therefore, I would say that the Hilton Tokyo is in line with other hotels in this country. The price point for everything is very high at this hotel, but not out of line with typical Japanese prices. Tokyo, in particular, is an expensive city.Overall, I was very happy and would be pleased to stay here again in the future or to recommend it to friends.","Bangkok, Thailand","NRV2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",29,5.0

While the breakfast in the lounge was not as extensive as in lobby restaurant, ready made omelets and limited buffet food was standard as was fresh squeezed orange juice.

I hadn't even touched my bag before being offered assistance by a smiling young woman who escorted me to the front desk, luggage in tow. Her vivacious nature was a positive indication of the type of stay I would come to experience. Although it was two hours before official check-in, I was immediately accommodated by the equally welcoming front desk associate, and assigned an upgraded room on a high floor with sweeping city views. Executive Lounge access was provided due to my Hilton Honors Diamond status, and I was even given a drink voucher for the St. George's Bar in the lobby, which I gifted to a surprised guest I encountered in the elevator. My room was comfortable and well appointed. I loved the sliding Japanese screens that added a degree of privacy to both the exterior windows and the interior bathroom shower. All furnishings were in excellent repair and the room was immaculately clean, and kept that way for the duration of my three night stay. Housekeeping was performed efficiently and discreetly without the incessant knocking and repetitive announcing of, ""housekeeping,"" so prevalent in many hotels around the world. Tips left on the bed pillow for the housekeeper were neatly removed to the adjacent nightstand, left unpocketed, an occurrence one sees only in Japan. The unusual shower setup was quite interesting, and the flooding I anticipated never occurred due to the ingenious drainage system. Water pressure was very strong, and I never encountered a shortage of hot water. Toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn, and replaced as needed. A minibar fridge was fully stocked, and complimentary bottled water replenished daily. The bedding, pillows and mattress were of a high standard and most comfortable. I slept very well. My only criticism is that my neighbors on the other side of the connecting door would occasionally get a bit animated, and the ensuing noise would filter into my room. If you have a choice, ask for a room without such a door. The Executive Lounge was very busy at times during the weekend, but quieted down during the weekdays. No matter, it was well run with typical Japanese efficiency and grace. Despite this having been my first time visiting this property, I was continually addressed by name and made to feel like royalty. Drinks were proactively refilled, dishes quickly cleared and preferential seating offered. Kudos to Keynon-san and all the team members for making guests feel so valued. The breakfast, afternoon and evening offerings were of a high caliber, rotated daily and kept replenished before they ran out, no matter how busy. Not an easy task, given the number of guests during peak periods. In my many years of travel, there are many pleasant experienes that remain memorable, but none so personal and satisfying as mine at this Hilton. I will go out of my way to stay here at every opportunity.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","flyme2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",38,5.0

We checked into our room, only to find that the room was slightly different than the pictures on the website. When we asked the front desk, they noted that some of the rooms are not renovated and the pictures on the website are of the renovated rooms. The staff mentioned that only some rooms below the 21st floor have renovated rooms, making it a challenge to locate one. The staff was able to locate a renovated room for us, but unfortunately, the room type was slightly different than the one we reserved, therefore there was a difference in price. We decided to splurge and I'm glad we did because the renovated room was spacious and had more light. I can't speak enough of the service of the staff. They were so accommodating. We utilized the concierge for day trips and other recommendations and they were very patient with us, even though there was a line behind us and they took as much time that was needed to help us.

If you prefer going walking to Shinjuku Staion it would take 15 minutes. Or you could use the metro, that was 8-10 minutes walking from the hotel.

One time when we could not make it back to the desk to follow up on one of the sites, a detailed letter was left for us in our room with all of the pertinent information. They WOWED us!

The hotel is located in Shinjuku and offers a free shuttle (a large bus) to and from the Shinjuku train station every 20 minutes - see picture (last bus from station at 9:40 pm). There are also 2 train lines walkable and directly under the hotel. The only negatives are 1. In the room there was a combo bathtub next to the shower and the shower heads did not quite properly fit the shower even if adjusted. It was a little awkward to use the shower, and 2. House keeping generally cleaned later in the day which was inconvenient. We came back to our room a couple of times, early afternoon after sight seeing and wanted to relax but our rooms had not been cleaned.

Tokyo being very populous and expensive city, many hotels including top notch ones, only occupies top floors of skyscrapers, sharing mid and bottom parts with business offices. However this hotel has its building solely for its own uses, making the hotel feel more like comfortable instant home away from home. This hotel utilizes huge area for executive club lounge which offer panoramic views of Japan including Mt. Fuji and other famous landmarks (I wasn’t very interested much except the Mountain Fuji view but I could definitely tell one of the most valuable assets for the hotel is, good location which provides such good panoramic views in the heart of bustling city)I heard the lounge is always so full, but I was lucky to enjoy good time without crowd, and I took breakfast at lounge all the time despite I heard breakfast restaurants on 1st and 2nd floors provides much more menus.One bad thing was, restaurants the concierge recommended – classic Japanese deep fries course restaurants, wasn’t much to my satisfaction personally. The restaurants had many good reviews from tripadvisor I saw, but my own perception is, anything can taste good if fried and there are too many good stuffs to enjoy with the price of the deep fries course meal- I heard deep fries are one of the high-end meals in Japan, but hope concierge offers more options for the guests who ask for good recommendation.The location is, I wouldn’t say, it is too perfect, because it requires hotel shuttle bus or quick taxi ride from Shinjuku and nearby stations, but the hotel has very good access from both Haneda & Narita airport. I usually do not like taking subways but in Japan, there are almost no options. However, you can take airport limousines from both airports (but it takes bit more than then taking subways), and hotel can book your return bus to airport. The hotel is also easy to go to Ginza, Omotesando, and other popular areas by subway (connected to hotel ground floor). As i heard, the hotel rarely gives gold benefit- anyway, I booked executive rooms because I wanted access to executive lounge as I ways do. The hotel say they are always full so I recommend to book the types of rooms you want even if you are a diamond or gold member. The hotel seems busy all the time indeed. I would definitely consider being there again. (some of reviews I studied before my trip had, some staffs are not very nice but for my stay, most staffs were very professional and nice, and provided excellent service with feeling of hospitality).","San Francisco, California","Roieea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",1,4.0

There were issues we faced and they brought my rating down. The physical hotel is nice. Standard rooms are comfortable and whilst bathrooms are small with showers in the tub, they certainky worked well and were clean.Service is where it becomes hit and miss and it seems the excuse is ""It's a big hotel"". Gold upgrade not provided. I can understand during busy periods however I believe the reason why they couldn't accomodate us was simply that they don't plan properly and advised me they totally ignore the online check in. Why ask guests to check in, what time they will arrive and also confirm that early check in which provides room assignment automatically (and gave me no choice) will not impact upgrades. When i arrived I was offered a twin upgrade after booking a king with a confirmed kids bed. I was told that I had selected a room already (complete contradiction to the online system), I was told one cannot book extra beds (it in facts states you must when booking) and when I challenged this I was asked to prove it which I did. I was then told if we keep the standard king room then we wouldn't be entitled to lounge access and breakfast. All in all not a good start. Basically in the end they ""generously"" offered ""something they never do"" which was lounge access. What I feel is a gold card entitlement. After all this they then said they were moving us to a different room which was a little more spacious. What I don't understand is how then they managed to get the extra bed into the room in the minutes it took us to get upstairs. Something was off. They had said they would send up amenities For the extra person with the bed. We waited 2.5 hours until 10pm to get a bath towel. The whole thing felt sordid.This was followed by concierge failing to assist effectively with restaurant reservations leaving us stranded and forced to eat in a smokey Hilton restaurant that was like a zoo with very average food and highly over priced.There were too many dropped balls and the underlying issue seemed to be that everyone wanted to argue about everything rather than take responsibility and make it right, as the promised. Room service was awful with poorly cooked food. Cold fries and 90 minutes to eventually recieve over priced but edible food. Again they new there were issues as they had to replace food twice yet no one made it right.They tried on check out but that's too late.I have had too many sub par experiences with Hilton who it seems are struggling world wide to compete in terms of service and the ""make it right"" philosophy is great if delivered on.It's a shame as the hotel has all the makings of a great experience but in all honesty the team need to stand up and be responsible for the short comings.","Bangkok, Thailand","BigT71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",146,3.0

While the bathtub was small and deep the shower made up for it. The sliding door between the bedroom and living room also made it comfortable and more private for us traveling with our kid.We had access to the Executive Lounge which always proves useful for less crowded breakfasts, lunch snacks (which we were never around for) and pre-dinner drinks and light food which was great though we were rarely back early enough to truly utilize this.The amenities were all good including the pool, spa and gym.There is one absolutely massive downside to the hotel and that is undoubtedly it restaurants, which while they seem to be very nice, the prices are simply outrageous and unjustifiable.

Breakfast in the main restaurant had great variety but the hostesses always wore sour faces and didn't seem very happy to see us. The service staff was much nicer but service was just as awful, it was clear that they were shorthanded. If you have access, then breakfast in the Executive Lounge is the way to go, way more peaceful and not that much difference in selection and variety. Japanese breakfast at Junisoh was a great experience too, definitely a must try if you have access.Executive Lounge was another disappointment. Service during Breakfast hours was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Came the afternoon and evening though, it felt like a completely different place. It was an absolute madhouse every evening with increasingly boisterous crowds. I didn't get what the draw was since the offerings were very poor for Asian standards. The staff also seemed to have given up trying to provide any kind of basic service in the evenings.Thankfully, the hotel does provide a special private lounge down the hall from the main lounge to qualified guests. The staff didn't proactively advertise about the existence of this private lounge though, even to qualified guests, so make sure to ask the staff about it if you are qualified.Overall the whole experience was very underwhelming. I will not recommend the hotel unless you are a Gold or Diamond Hilton Honors member for which you will get additional benefits.

The evening fare is good too, yes not as much of a spread of food as other Hilton lounges in Asia, but they have an ample selection of drinks and the canapes are constantly replenished. It's the staff though that set this lounge apart from others, they were all so polite, kind and courteous at all times. Nothing ever seemed too much trouble. I was blown away when my suitcase broke on my check out date, the lounge manager Keynon went above and beyond, he took care of everything and personally went and got it repaired for me. Such caring and genuine service is rare to find in this industry. In fact the whole team in the executive lounge; Tsukuda, Makoto and Chihiro are all a huge asset to this establishment.

It's Hilton, it's not cheap, my expectations are gonna be higher than if I was at a small budget hotel in the city.The pros: -Large rooms by Japanese standards. Great for families or your American grandparents visiting Asia for the first time. If you still think their rooms look small you need to go to Four Seasons or Peninsula in Tokyo and I'm not being sarcastic.-All the amenities/services from a big brand hotel: gym, pool, sauna, different restaurants, a team of concierge. Everyone spoke great English, had no problem with communication. They also sell the day passes for Tokyo Subway at concierge.-Direct access to underground for the subway, or there's 3 shuttle/hour to JR Shinjuku train station. Many people complain about this hotel not being near Shinjuku JR. Note that there are no big roomy hotels near Shinjuku JR. It's either nice spacious rooms here, or you're walking distance to the JR station but staying in a small cramped room. This is as close as you can get to it for this type of hotel. Personally as a tourist I prefer getting around Tokyo using subway vs JR whenever possible, since they offer a foreigner day pass at 800/yen day which is a fantastic deal.-Airport Limousine stop onsite. When you are going home with bags and bags of stuff you bought you don't need to stress about how you're gonna get on the train to the airport. Also great if you want zero hassle with getting to hotel from airport.-Beds were very comfortable, great view of the city lights. Good closet/wardrobe space for storing things.The cons/room for improvement:-Amenities are not bad but lacking compared to its neighbor Hyatt Regency. Across the street at Hyatt they have a convenience service that'll deliver anything from humidifiers, charging cables, down to bath salts, nail clippers and skin care products to your room free. Hilton offers no skincare products, had a nice bathtub but no bath salts (only shower gel). No coffee machine and only instant coffee mix, I find that unacceptable at this price range. Tea selection not very thoughtful seems random. So the rooms look nice on the Internet, but once I was inside the room all these small things started popping up which detracted from the experience.-Wifi is free only if you sign up for their membership. I understand the membership is free, but still this is a hassle, just give me the password and let me get on the internet. It's 2017, not all of us are traveling on business and can charge to our company so stop nickel and diming people.-I wish the shuttle ran until 11 p.m. With the amount of activities at night in Shinjuku it would be a very nice touch to extend the hours a little.Overall it's still a good hotel, I still recommend this place to families or people looking for a comfortable stay. Also, if you are a Hilton regular/have rewards points then stay here. I hate to say it, but Hyatt Regency across the street offers everything here and a little more for about the same price. If I were to stay in Shinjuku again I'll most likely choose Hyatt Regency over Hilton unless there's improvements, sorry :/","Seattle, Washington","Maggie F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",15,3.0

Check in was quick and was given 2224 ( the executive lounge was on the 37th floor). Although my profile requests a room away from the elevators , the room was right across the hall from the elevator lobby but I did not hear any noise.The room was large, quiet and well equipped with night and a cafetiere as well as ordinary instant coffee.Two aspects of the room design slightly disappointed me;(1) a lack of drawer space and located under the tv and by the door entrance(2) poor design of the bathroom. Although the bath/shower wet room was huge as the door opened outwards towards the wc you had to virtually step out into the hallway then close the shower door to access the sinkThe Executive lounge was excellent with excellent and friendly staff. Breakfast was excellent with a fresh orange juice machine and a made to order omelette station. The lounge has two views one towards Shinjuku and one facing towards Mt Fuji (which you can see on a clear day)Afternoon tea was excellent with a great range of sandwiches cakes and snacks and evening drinks were good also.The fitness centre and pool were excellent ( on the 5th floor)There is a convenience store in the Hiltopia complex accessible via the basement of the hotel.The hotel is about a 10-15min walk from Shinjuku station ( shuttle bus available from 8am) and is close to the Shinjuku city park and the Metropolitan Tokyo Govt buildings ( two free observation decks in the north & south towers.There is a Limousine bus to Narita airport ( first bus at 520am) I took the 550am bus and was at T2 Narita at 725am.

The people are kind and we all know the employees make or break the hospitality industry. I would like to recognize Ernesto in the guest service department for going above and beyond to make my award stay as a diamond member seamless, unforgettable, fun, and every other positive adjective imaginable. He not only recognized my diamond status from the moment I arrived, but fully explained all of the wonderful and unique features of the Hilton Tokyo. He encouraged me to sign up for the traditional Japanese breakfast, upgraded me to a penthouse level tower suite on the 38th floor (yes, you read that right!), hand delivered my luggage to my room, drew me a map complete with subway instructions, shopping recommendations and even found me a great spot to eat dinner. He is a fantastic employee who deserves to be recognized for his efforts. He goes above and beyond in every guest encounter. Even in the 10 minutes I stood with him he held the elevator door for guests, asked everyone around them how he could help, and had a huge smile on his face.

We bought reserved seats on the bullet train so we could sit together but what we didn't realize is that made us commit to the departure time from Kyoto. ($500rt). You can do non-reserved seats for the bullet train for about $12 less. You aren't committed to a time/train but you might not sit together. We spent 20 min (typing translating on an iPad) to actually figure all this out and buy the tickets because we were unfamiliar and language barrier) Even then we made it from the hotel to Tokyo station (and bullet train) in about an hour. We should of asked for a window seat though because she gave us a center and aisle seat and you can't change seats once you board or pay without a fee.

From Haneda airport, we took the Friendly airport limousine which deposited us right at the Hilton's doorstep. The hotel staff greeted us warmly and we were checked in at a reasonable time. The room was adequate in size and while smaller than other rooms in other countries, keep in mind this is Tokyo where space is a premium. We found their gym fullyequipped with treadmills, statio bikes, cardio machines, and a small pool and made use of them on a daily basis. We did not have an opportunity to eat at the hotel but enjoyed the nearby districts' eating places which are numerous. I also appreciated the staff's help in booking our Hakone-Mt Fuji tour and reservation with the airport limousine back to the airport at the end of our trip. For our transport, we had a choice of taking the subway which had an at the hotel or a shuttle which will take you to the Shinjuku station. Form these points, you are connected to almost anywhere. Btw, we got the bundle transport from the airport which had roundtrip bus plus 72 hour subway use which cost us about 3500 yen.

The location of this property is fantastic as we were close to the heartbeat of Tokyo...Shinjuku. Shopping, restaurants, shows, and most importantly, the Tokyo metro station was a stones throw from the hotel. While the lights and action of Shinjuku would have been enough adrenaline to keep you awake, the hotel was nicely placed in a quiet neighborhood far enough away so that when you did retire for the evening, it was a peaceful sleep. What was great about the hotel was the friendly staff and the room which was at the standard of what we were used to. A king size bed instead of the traditional Japanese setup of two twin beds. Views were amazing and the decor of the hotel was in line with what one would expect in a great city as Tokyo was. The complimentary shuttle transported those that wanted to get to the shopping district fast, but with the great facilities for pedestrians in Tokyo, we walked everywhere. The Tokyo metro station is connected to the hotel which was very convenient. When our stay was over we boarded a shuttle bus that took us directly to the airport without ever leaving the property.

The daily charge for standard wifi is 1000 yen. They do offer free wifi in the lobby if you can be bothered going down there - a lot of guests hang around (probably the ones that were not eligible for free wifi in their rooms).The day before we were due to check out, I called the guest services hotline to ask the best way to get to Shinjuku Station so we could catch the Narita Express train to the airport but was told that the only way to get there was to walk (I thought this was strange, as I knew there was a free shuttle bus from the Hilton to Shinjuku but thought maybe we weren’t allowed to take luggage on the shuttle). On my way out, I asked the concierge desk to double check and they said we could take the free shuttle even with our luggage. Not sure why the information is inconsistent. It is also not conveniently located if you want to stay out late. While it is connected to Nishi-Shinjuku station, there is only one subway line passes through here and the walkway closes at around 10pm, which means if you want to get to other parts of Tokyo you’ll have to make a few transfers.

The 1 star is for the helpful concierge and decent breakfast. However, that is where the good points end. We booked our hotel room through an online agent, Japan-Ican. My husband is a Hilton Honors gold member and when we tried to register his membership number to the room, we were told that since we booked through an agent, showing his card has no effect. Meaning that his patronage would not even be acknowledged. I can understand that no points may be counted, but to acknowledge a paid visit would seem to be appropriate if the hotel would like to establish any long-term relationship with it's loyal guests. Further disappointment came when we requested to extend check-out time from the usual 12pm to 2pm. Again, we are told that due to the booking being made through an agent, that the request will not be entertained. That is perhaps the worst and most absurd reason to refuse late check-out. So the hotel wants to make it clear that it doesn't like us or any other customers for booking through an agent. If you don't like agents, then don't sell your rooms through them. Why compromise good service and act in such a petty manner? This will be the very last time that we patronize this establishment or any of it's chain hotels.

In fact, between all of my stays during the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the 2000s, I am certain that I have spend more than one year of my life living at this hotel. So, that lets you know my overall feelings about his establishment.This hotel is very nice and it is easy to get to from Narita International Airport (NRT). There is direct limousine bus and they drop you off right in front of the hotel. Then, the bell men quickly grab your bags for you.The front desk staff is always nice. Checking in is easy and there is always a very nice person who escorts you to your room. Though it is not really customary to tip in Japan, (as some employees find this offensive), this is a Western hotel chain and it seems that the staff have become accustomed to tipping. Though it is not required, my recommendation is to give the bell man somewhere in the neighborhood of five-hundred to one-thousand Yen. They always smile and they never turn it down.The rooms are always great at this hotel and well maintained. If they do not give you a room on one of the higher floors when you check in, my suggestion is to ask for one as this hotel provides you with some great views of Tokyo and beyond. You can even get a view of Fujiyama if you are on the right side of the hotel.More than just a place to stay, this hotel has a few very good restaurant, a nice bar, and a fun shopping arcade on its basement level. Check them out. It will be worth your time.This hotel is located just a few blocks from Shinjuku Station, so getting around Tokyo and beyond is very easy. It is also just a few blocks from the Shinjuku entertainment district. So, again, you are close to having something fun to do. Take a walk, that is one of the best things to do in Tokyo!

I had Visa troubles here in Korea where I live and found myself planning a last-minute trip to Tokyo for an overnight trip and arrived during a typhoon, but my frazzled nerves were instantly soothed when I stepped through the doors of the Hilton. The entryway air is laced with some softly sweet fragrance (rose maybe?) and I found myself relaxing right away. The lobby is spacious and grand but also divided into smaller areas in a way that prevents that “Grand Central Station” feeling you get in so many corporate hotel chains. All the service I encountered was exceptional, from the warm and efficient check-in and check-out, to the bell desk, room service, guest services, executive lounge breakfast, to the the doorman (actually a woman) who called me a taxi when I departed. My room was beautiful, spacious, and had some nice design touches like the fact that you could see through the shower/tub room’s glass walls from the sink to the bedroom and out the window beyond. Of course there were screens you could close for privacy, but I was traveling alone and loved the sense of light and airiness. The bed was super comfortable (and I’m super picky about my beds!), the room was perfectly soundproofed and the room had all the amenities - tea kettle, TV, steam iron, etc. It’s a short, beautiful walk to either Shinjuku station (and all the amazing shopping and dining around there) or a relaxing, leafy green park with a lovely Shinto shrine in it. Its a slightly longer walk (20 minutes maybe?) to the Meiji Jinto and Shrine, which is a must-see on any visitor’s itinerary. If you keep walking through THAT you find yourself in Harajuku where the shopping and people watching is second-to-none. Absolutely perfect location!

We had a BIG room on the 36th floor with a wonderful view, enormous bed,slept great each night!The only thing I could fault in the room is not loads of space.This would not bother me ,but we stayed a long 10 days. I do not think most folks stay that long just in Tokyo itself.Eyeland across the street had loads of restaurants, the hgotel has a shuttle to the Shinjuku Train station that takes 5 minutes to get there, and next to that are worlds of department stores.The weather was horrible(August always is) but the room was cool and refreshing. I used the pool and that was great too. Staff is friendly. The breakfast is probably the best I have ever had in a Hilton,which are always good!The only things I was not crazy about were in the lobby. It is a huge hotel and huge lobby,and there are 9 bench seats and one chair.People do not sit here after shopping or have a visit.Some friends came for me and we had to go directly out in the heat.The other thing was the super lemony tea smell in the lobby, like a beauty parlor hair spray in the 50s..

It was technically a layover as we were moving home, and we decided to stretch the layover into three nights to allow for sightseeing and to stretch our legs before the long flight home.I booked this hotel online with our Hilton Honors membership, which is free to join. With Hilton Honors you get free in-room wi-fi. The cost for three nights are in a King Deluxe room, advance pay (no refunds or cancellations), with breakfast, was 126,302.90 Japanese Yen, which was about $1,139 USD. That comes to about $380 per night. I generally refuse to pay this much for hotels. However, I figured Tokyo is in general an expensive city, and I wanted something comfortable and easy. I looked into many options to get from Narita Airport to the Hilton and settled on the Airport Limousine Bus. I was concerned about how to reserve these tickets in advance, but I ended up just getting off the airplane, going though customs, getting my baggage, and getting in the line at the Airport Limousine Bus counter. There are three counters in Terminal 1, two counters in Terminal 2, and one counter in Terminal 3. There is also one counter at Haneda Airport. It was easy to find the counter. I simply stood in line and bought the tickets on the spot. I had also been concerned that there wouldn't be enough seats on the bus and we would have to wait around for a later bus, but that didn't happen. I bought the tickets around 4:05 pm for the 4:30 pm bus, which gave us enough time to use the restroom, buy some snacks at the convenience store, and wait in line outside for the bus and get our baggage tagged. We had six pieces of luggage plus a stroller which is why I opted for the bus over the train. The bus goes directly from the airport to the door of the Hilton Tokyo (with a few other stops in Shinjuku, the area where the Hilton is located). It was very convenient. One round-trip ticket is 4,500 Yen. I bought a round-trip Narita ticket combined with a 72 hour subway ticket (on all Tokyo Metro and Toni Subway Lines) for 6,000 Yen. I also bought a ticket for my toddler because of how much baggage we had (I think the bus permits 2 pieces of baggage per person), although she could have sat in my lap at no cost. Going to the Hilton the ride took 1.5 hours. Going to the airport took 2 hours (45 minutes of that was picking up passengers at other stops in Shinjuku). I would definitely take the airport bus again if I had a lot of baggage or wanted an alternative to navigating the train/metro upon arrival. Check in was easy. I had purchased baseball tickets in advance and the tickets were safely with the concierge. I had a room request that I made in the online reservation and it was remembered. The Hilton check in representative even gave my toddler a little bag with a coloring book, crayons, a child's toothbrush and toothpaste, and slippers. There are six elevators that serve rooms on about 37 floors, so the elevator lobby is always busy and sometimes you have to wait for a second elevator. Our room was on the tenth floor. There was no special view. The view from the window was of some nondescript buildings. The Crabtree & Evelyn Verebena & Lavender toiletries were a lovely touch. The windows had a Japanese type sliding cover, and for black out purposes there was an even heavier shade to slide over the windows. I appreciated both shades and used both quite a bit. There were disposable white slippers, an iron with a cute plastic cover, fresh white bath towels, and two bottled waters replaced at no charge each day. The bed was comfortable. The room is small by western standards, but I was still able to fit 5 large pieces of luggage, a stroller, and set up my toddler's pack and play in the corner. It was a tight fit but we managed. The Hilton is in a good spot for taking the subway. I was intimidated just looking at the subway map, so every morning I would first check with the Hilton concierge regarding my route, and they were all friendly, clear and helpful. We took the subway to Roppongi (four stops away from Shinjuku station on the red Marunouchi line) for lunch one day at the Grand Hyatt to eat Kobe steak. We took the subway and JR train to Chiba, where we watched a baseball game (we passed Disneyland to get to Chiba and saw Cinderella's castle from the train window). In the hotel lobby, you can take the escalator down one level and walk via an underground walkway to the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. This is how we got to Tokyo Station (about 10 stops away on the red Marunouchi line), which is where we caught the JR Keiyo line. We walked to Shinjuku station one morning to explore. Taxis are not cheap in Tokyo but they are convenient. We've been spoiled by low cost Uber in Southeast Asia. But taxis in Tokyo are safe and clean. The doors even open automatically- just stand/sit there and the driver will press a button to open your door. We took taxis to two restaurants in Roppongi. We took a taxi to a batting cage one morning.I also took the taxi to Shinjuku station (the Keio Department store) one morning when I was in a rush to buy some last minute souvenirs before our flight (less than 1,000 yen). I also took a taxi to the Tokyu Hands store which is next to Takashimaya for souvenir shopping. It was fun walking back to the Hilton at night because the air was cool and the streets were busy and there were lots of shops and restaurants to pass. There is a 24 hour mini supermarket about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a nice park about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. At the park's southern end there is a children's playground. It's a further walk to the playground and we only stayed for about 30 minutes because the cicadas in the summer are so very loud (loudest insect in the world).Breakfast was filled with options but always very busy. It runs until 10:30 am. There is an omelette station which always had a line, many types of breads, pancakes, French toast, juices, fresh kale juice, smoothies, soymilk, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, an assortment of Japanese breakfast items including salted salmon, and some Chinese breakfast items.I would absolutely stay here again assuming I had the resources. It's convenient location, cleanliness and the friendly staff make it a comfortable choice.","San Francisco, California","Lea_Anne97</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",101,4.0

We were able to check in early and our room was well appointed and relatively spacious (most hotel rooms in Japan are on the small side but this was quite big).The hotel is very handy for both Tochomae and Nishi Shinjuku underground stations, though you can get a free shuttle bus which runs every 20 minutes from the western side of Shinjuku Station (and wasn't particularly well advertised anywhere). From either station you can actually remain underground as you walk to the hotel, which is a bonus in the heat of the summer.I walked west, into the more residential area of Shinjuku, and found lots of nice places to eat and a supermarket - as well as a really good, 24h, coin laundry, which has a nice Indian restaurant next door.

Not often. Perhaps never. Hilton Tokyo did just that. It delivered and then some. Having stayed all over the world and experiencing so many different tourist destinations, it is not often that our family decides to forego a trip or delay the start of a tour or rush back early from a day of exhausting sightseeing to get back to our beloved hotel. But this was the case here. The executive junior room with the breakfast included for 8 days and 7 nights was pure bliss. The room was spacious and oh so clean! And those remarkable Hilton beds. Sinking into it at the end of a hot summer day in Tokyo was exactly what the doctor ordered. The next morning we would rush to the marble lounge for breakfast. My kids who never wake up early did so for this hotel's amazing breakfast. And did I mention the subway is attached to the hotel?! Attached!! From that subway we traveled like true Tokyo natives all over the city and even to Kyoto! Want to shop when it's raining outside? Don't worry. Hilton Tokyo has you covered literally. They not only have the subway metro right under your nose but they also offer complimentary shuttle buses to Shinjuku, a thriving shopping district. My husband and I woke up early each morning for the marvelous gym(food in Tokyo can add up to those calories!) and my family so enjoyed the pool. Every request we had and every whim was granted. And the concierge was perhaps the best I have ever experienced. Especially Sato. She gave us the best restaurant recommendations and they were spot on every time.

The staff were all very courteous and most helpful and never failed to greet you warmly. There was a good selection on the buffet breakfast at the Marble Lounge. There was also an option of breakfast at the executive lounge and Japanese breakfast at Junisoh, the Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, we really appreciated all the extra space in the bedroom (44sqm). The room and furnishing looks new except for a few minor brown stains on the carpet. There is a free shuttle bus to/from Shinjuku Station. It tends to get quite crowded coming from Shinjuku Station because the hotel runs many special lunch/afternoon tea promotions. There were one or two occasions where we almost couldn't get on the bus. The hotel could possibly consider utilising a bus with a larger capacity during anticipated busy hours. Alternatively, it is a pleasant 3-5 minute walk underground to the nearest metro/subway station from the hotel. The Airport Limousine Bus for both Haneda and Narita also come to this hotel which makes it really convenient especially if you have a lot of luggage.On a slightly negative note, there are 6 lifts that service 38 floors on this property and they get very busy during peak hours. Imagine trying to get down from one of the higher floors, in a very full lift and stopping at every other floor. And the swimming pool was rather small and nondescript for such a big hotel but who comes to Tokyo to swim right? In summary, the Hilton is an excellent hotel with impeccable customer service.

Two other notes:-The cleaning lady came in and cleaned while we were still in the room...I'm not sure if this was a language issue but it was very awkward as we were still dressing and getting ready.-We asked the hotel for a recommendation to a nice steakhouse for a splurge dinner. Unfortunately, the place they recommended did not speak any English which we found strange for a upscale restaurant. As a result, we had complications with our orders and spent quite a lot of money on food that was only so-so and not exactly what we thought we ordered.",,KellyM5143,6,5.0

I especially want to call attention to the GREAT concierge service. They will help you with literally everything; from directions, to navigating the transportation system, to making reservations for you etc. They go far beyond expectations and go out of their way to get you set up with maps, information so on. Thus definitely make use of their friendly service and help.I would advise against paying for the included breakfast option. It is a buffet that is something like $30 a person, while the property has several breakfast options within a five minute walk, from a Denny's, to a café called the Royal Host, to a Starbucks. At these locations we would get a full breakfast for three for only around $20 U.S.The property is in a great location, less then a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, and a 15 minute walk to the center of Shinjuku's daytime shopping and the center of the evening and night activity.You can't go wrong choosing the Shinjuku Hilton for your stay.",los angeles,"Kepuhi-Dream</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles</strong>",97,4.0

While pricey, the restaurants served fantastic food and was a great dining experience. Choices include a western BBQ place, a Japanese restaurant, and I believe a Chinese restaurant as well, in addition to their dessert shop. The shuttle will quickly take you to Shinjuku station which allows you to essentially travel all over Japan. Luxury certainly comes with a price, but it's well worth it.

Views out over Nishi (west) Shinjuku, and about 15 minutes walk back to JR Shinjuku although the Maranouchi line has a stop just next to the hotel and can be reached in less than 10 minutes. The hotel has a shuttle bus to ferry you back and forth to the station also. The executive lounge on the 37th floor is huge and caters for mainly executive room guests with a separate gold/diamond lounge located on the same floor looking after Hhonors members. We enjoyed the superb service from Waki who hosts the gold/diamond lounge. Both lounges offer a great selection of food, with a chef making omelettes in the main lounge in the morning and supported by friendly English speaking service staff. The pool and fitness centre is located on the 5th floor and has a lovely pool, sauna and onsen which is a real treat. The cocktail bar on level two has a nice ambience and had live entertainment when we were there.

The facilities are pristine, I'd mark this as one of if not the best Hilton I've ever visited. While nice facilities are all well and good, the true high marks go to the staff who were some of the best I've encountered. The concierge was beyond patient and helpful, and those who worked in the executive lounge morning and evening were attentive, polite, and truly were the game changer during our stay. Two in particular (Hilton, this is where you take notes and reward them) - Mami (didn't get her surname) who worked the breakfast buffet went above and beyond, recognizing us and customizing service to our preferences each subsequent day. In the afternoons, I didn't get her name, but she attended Temple university and spent 4 months in Philadelphia.. her English could easily pass for a native Californian, and her personable attentiveness and charming conversation made for an outstanding experience as she offered tips on what we might enjoy seeing.

A 5* room. - Executive lounge wasn't overwhelmed - food options at breakfast were decent, not spectacular. Would probably try the restaurants instead. For light snack, it was a bit sparse but quiet and comfortable. - Of course, the staff was quite welcoming. Got a late checkout. - The health club is solid - 24/7 access, decent equipment. Lots of cardio, weight areas are smallish but workable. - Proximity to transit - walk to the Hyatt Regency across the street (about 5 minutes) to get to the subway - Shinjuku lines are ~10 minute walk away. Depends what you're carrying and your tolerance for heat. Cons- It was a bit of a nuthouse in the lobby - I thought maybe the pricing would keep out the riff raff, but no such luck. Lots of loud Americans. I'm American, but not loud...if you're looking to get away, then I guess Shinjuku isn't the right place.

The hotel also hosts many restaurants that will satisfy your hunger, and a breakfast buffet with great staff that will rush at your assistance. Although, the hotel could change the food menus once in awhile, but other than that the food is great. The rooms are absolutely great, my family was fortunate enough to be served by an excellent hotel manager by the name of Ernesto Bressan, a very kind manager that is a hardworker and goes beyond the call of duty. If you have trouble with anything, just ask for him and he'll solve your problems. The maids at the hotel are great and do great jobs cleaning your hotels. The rooms with the views are gorgeous as they show the bustling city of Tokyo. The toilets at the hotel are quite hilarious but get the job done. Cheers to the hotel. I also have to add that when you walk into the hotel, the smell is absolutely fantastic! I can't even explain it in words, it's just so good! The hotel has a gym and a pool. The gym has everything you need, training your biceps and core and such. The pool also has a view of the city and a window on the top of the roof where you can see the sky. The hotel is very convenient and is around many areas such as Tokyo Station (you will be needing this), restaurants that are fantastic, and walking distance to the Metropolitan Government building where you can access the top floor where you can also see Tokyo, free of charge!

The concierge was able to make restaurant reservations on ur behalf and would even leave a note under ur room door to let u know once ur table has been secured.Location wise it is one stop away from the bustling shinjuku main station on the west side meaning that it was convenient yet quiet. There is also a free shuttle to shinjuku west station entrance outside keio department store that departs from the lobby every 20mins.

I went to the check-in counter and noted that I had two rooms. The front desk person noted that I was a gold member of Hilton Honors and asked if I wanted connecting rooms. I agreed, but then he came back and stated that connected rooms were only on the executive rooms. So he upgraded us to Executive level and assigned me two connecting rooms. It was a great way to start off our stay here.The rooms themselves are very clean. The shower had excellent hot water and pressure. The beds are not too hard, but softer than I would expect for Tokyo. The room also came with a safe that worked as well as slippers.

The shuttle bus travels every 20 minutes between Shinjuku station (the world’s busiest) and the hotel in less than 10 minutes. The trick is to find the bus first time round. Arriving at Shinjuku station with the Narita Express, our instructions told us to find the West gate, which is not available in the station building you arrive in. One has to exit and move across a wide street to the next station building (green JR sign as well as a Lumine2 sign) where you will find signs for the West gate and Mosaic street. Go for Mosaic street which is a small laneway lined with modern boutiques and coffee shops. Once through, take a left, pass the Rolex store and you will find bus stop 21 were the Hilton shuttle stops every 20 minutes (00, 20, 40). If you don’t want to wait, there is a taxistand by the Rolex store and it is less than 1000 Yen to the Hilton.We stayed here for a holiday and happy to stay here again.

The Hilton offers a great value for its location and has very clean rooms (which were recently renovated and looked beautiful). Their overall service was very good too. Our only real complaint was that it was the only place we stayed in our entire 2 week trip to Japan that didn't offer free WIFI?! I mean... seriously? Who does that now days? We thought this was a total joke. The hotel charges $10.00 USD per day for basic WIFI, and an astounding $20.00 USD per day for faster WIFI. We simply couldn't wrap our heads around this why any 'nice' hotel in today's age would charge for WIFI. So that was a big ding for us.

Despite its size, the 1st floor lobby offers a small sitting area. Because there is a large eating area occupying half of the floor, I only saw 2 arm chairs and 2 back to back couches (allowing maybe 10 to 12 people to sit). As to the shower in our room, the glass panel on the tub was too short in my opinion. I prefer a wall to wall panel so that you can take a shower without worrying about spilling and splashing water to the bathroom floor. The hotel has few restaurants (look great but on expensive side). However, it appears that every high rise building nearby has a restaurant floor or two, usually in the basement area.

Most hotels were fully booked and overpriced for a small room, hence we decided to spend just a little bit more and got the Suite in Hilton Tokyo.Location: Strategically located in Shinjuku, it is a great tourist spot which is convenient but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle. If you like a more serene area that's 5-10 mins walks away from the heart of the shopping area, then this is perfect. Cabs were aplenty and there is also an Airport Limousine service that stops right at the entrance of the hotel.Hotel grounds: The facade of Hilton was typical - old and slightly outdated. The entrance/reception area are spacious but also the old world glamorous. Not updated and modern. Being a popular chain, it was definitely crowded.Room: We booked the Executive King Junior Suite which was 44sqm and it was luxurious and very spacious which is so precious in a crowded city. There were plenty of space to put our luggage and walk around. The king bed was comfy and there was a large living area with a huge sofa and coffee table. There was also a counter area with Japanese teapot set and Nespresso machine with complimentary tea, coffee and bottled water. The bathroom was a little small for a large room and the shower area is a little tiny which shares a relatively small bathtub. However I liked the strong water pressure and the Thomas Roth toiletries provided.Lounge: Staying in a suite means we get free access to the club lounge. As a typical international hotel chain, the lounge was big and had lots of variety of food and beverages, including all kinds of alcohol. The only downside was that it was VERY CROWDED. It's almost packed every evening when we were there (around 5/6pm) and this means that it can be a little rowdy. Dining: Other than the typical complimentary buffet or lounge breakfast, Hilton has a special Japanese breakfast (Kaiseki style) and requires reservation in advance and there are also seating timings too. This was unique hence we made an effort to try it at least once. The food was traditional and pretty good (which you can see from my photos) but I could tell that some of the guests were not used to the flavours. My husband and I, however enjoyed the experience.Service at the reception, lounge and all around were excellent hence we will definitely consider staying at Hilton again.","Singapore, Singapore","livefreeange</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",41,5.0

Here on vacation with wife and older daughter. Had a 1 bedroom suite (sounds spacial, and by Tokyo standards probably is but overall I thought the space was small, especially the bathroom). However, overall, I would say this property excels on service, the overall customer experience, the breakfast offering (both on the executive floor but especially on the main floor), and general proximity to all things in Tokyo.Specifics:- Shinjuku is as reasonable as any location in Tokyo. I know it's known for being a business center but access to the subway is excellent, there are lots of restaurants in the area, and the Shinjuku night district is within easy walking access. Shinjuku train station is a short walk away (or, take the Hilton shuttle bus every 20 or so minutes). You could go to Roppongi, or to central Tokyo, fine, no problem, but I found Shinjuku to be quite high quality.- Asian Hiltons are not the same as Hilton properties located in the U.S. (thankfully).- The Hilton Tokyo has an EXCEPTIONAL level of customer service.- Rooms: We had 2, a 1 bedroom suite and a regular room. Bathrooms are tiny in both. But other than that the rooms are generally fine. I would have preferred a bit better lighting in the suite. Beds were excellent. Showers more than adequate. A/C was fine. Internet very good.- Breakfast is awesome. Definitely get that in your room rate. Truly, this is the best breakfast buffet service we've ever encountered. Massive fruit offerings; smoked salmon; superb Asian fare; and the list goes on. I couldn't imagine how to improve on the offering.- Very convenient shuttle service to/from Shinjuku Station. Also direct bus service to/from Narita airport (although I recommend taking the Narita Express train to Shinjuku - it's faster, but not necessarily more convenient given that you have to navigate the expanse of Shinjuku Station.)- Restaurants on site are exceptional. The Metropolitan is special, but it comes at a price, however it is worth it. There are several other food options, and although I didn't have a chance to try them all, I would not hesitate to do so.- The 2 bars are exceptional, if not expensive (but, this is Tokyo), they are definitely exceptional quality and above average service.- Concierge service: Excellent.- Executive floor: Definitely worth it. The evening program of cocktails (free) and appetizers is an exceptional value.Bottom line: Price/value: Exceptional. Yes, this is a large hotel, generally business oriented, but not overly so. Japanese quality in terms of service and customer orientation. Footnote: There are two subway station entrances within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.Final comment: you will not go wrong on the price-value equation here. The Asian Hilton management (and I've stayed at several of their properties, several of which are 'franchised') across Asia, are excellent. Again, exceptional price-value.","Houston, Texas","daveHou</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",108,5.0

As you know, most Japanese hotels are small and usually will only accommodate 3 people in a room. So, our choices were already limited. We are Hilton Honors members and decided to the Hilton Tokyo a try, especially because there was a good deal on suites if I prepaid. So, that's what I did. However, to be frank, as we neared our trip, I was starting to worry about having selected the Hilton, since some friends recommended a few hotels that were more trendy and centrally located. In my mind, I started to compare it to some Hiltons I've stayed at in the U.S. which were not very nice. Luckily, I had already pre-paid and couldn't cancel. Hilton prepay had saved me from myself!!! The minute we walked in, we were all impressed. The assistance and guidance with our luggage and front desk service made us feel like royalty. Accommodations: We had a king suite on the 23rd floor and saying we were wowed is a huge understatement. I felt like I walked into a celebrity mansion on that old MTV show CRIBS. (see our photos attached). Since there were four of us, they had already set up an additional rollaway bed. The shower and bath combo was strange at first, but it all made sense later and we ended up loving it. One of my key evaluations of hotels worldwide is the water pressure and this hotel did not disappoint. The range of water pressure went from gentle spring to all out firehose!!! Wow!!! Let's not even mention the TOTO heated seat toilets and washlets. AMAAAAAZING!!! Everyone in America and the world needs to get a TOTO toilet. There would be world peace just from that alone.Executive lounge: OMG!!! The food and service there were beyond proper adjectives. There's a good mix between Western and Japanese breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice on demand. The omelettes were made with so much love, it was a show in itself just watching the Chef create it. Hard to explain, you just have to witness it yourself. (Caution: The eggs there might be too runny for more westerners, but not for us! Perfecto!) Our entire Japan trip could have been spent in our room, the lobby, the shops below the hotel (Hiltopia), and the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE and we would have been quite content.The RESTAURANTS in the hotel itself looked amazing. The pictures of the food shown in the elevator tempted us each time. However, because we had committed to actually leaving the property to see Tokyo, we opted not to eat at the hotel restaurants. CONVENIENCE: The hotel is conveniently situated between the Nishi (a.ka. West) Shinjuku & Tochomae Stations. Both stations can be accessed from a walkway below the hotel. From Nishi Shinjuku, you can easily hop on the Marunouchi line which connects you to the main Shinjuku Station. From the Tochomae Station you can catch the Oedo line to Ginza district. There's also a free Hilton Shuttle that takes you to and from Shinjuku Station. We never used it because it was so convenient to walk there.Cuurency exchange TIP: Getting YEN is more economical (given the competitive exchange rates) via ATM machines at convenience stores like 7-11. The 7-11 brand has their own banks call 7-Banks. Luckily for you, there is a 7-Bank stand alone ATM right below the hotel across from the convenience store. Hotel Pool: Was not open when we were here, but who comes all the way to Tokyo to sit in a pool??Getting to the hotel: You can easily get to the hotel from Narita Airport in comfort aboard the airport limousine. The bus driver and the hotel bellhops will handle your bags. Sit back and relax.Hotel location: The hotel is situated on the western side of Shinjuku. The western side is quieter and away from the madness of Shinjuku's eastern side. Great for a little respite from the crowds.Summary: During our 8 nights in Japan, we actually stayed at this hotel twice - the first 4 nights, then 2 nights at Hilton Osaka, then right back to Hilton Tokyo! Hilton Osaka was very very nice, but we all missed the executive lounge at Hilton Tokyo! We've been back two weeks already and my sons keep asking if I could make breakfast like the executive lounge? NO, I can't!!! I know everyone has different budgets, but I'm sure every room at this hotel is spectacular. Try to get access to the Executive Lounge. Even though it may appear to cost more, you save money by eating their complimentary and hearty breakfast/brunch. You can save money other ways with good cheap eats all around Tokyo too. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! We will stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo!!!",NorCal,"Steve H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NorCal</strong>",62,5.0

The view from our room, not as great. The Executive Lounge was a huge perk. Additionally, being a Diamond member at this Hilton had its advantages (where some Hiltons don’t even acknowledge that). Our room was not able to be upgraded so they sent up a ½ bottle of wine to our room. Our breakfast options were the Executive Lounge or the restaurant in the lobby. We ate at the restaurant each morning. This hotel is one of the busiest Hiltons I’ve stayed it. However, it did not impact the level of customer service. Everyone we ran into were very attentive and wanted to make sure their guests were happy. Would I stay again? When we went their room prices were quite high. I’m not sure it’s worth the cost, in all honesty. The hotel is a bit dated. I have no problem spending a lot on hotels. But I do if the room itself shows a lot of wear and tear, as ours did.

Shinjuku is a great neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. We had a family of 5, with one triple room with three twin beds, and one double room with two twin beds. The rooms were pretty standard, with a little Japanese flair, with nice views, comfortable beds, and nice amenities. The hotel is a big, bustling, Western-style luxury hotel, at the high end of the various Hilton properties around the world. I often stay in a Hilton Hotel in NYC, and I noticed right away that the lobby smelled very similar to the NYC hotel. We saw where they piped in the scent. I wonder if it is the Hilton signature scent? It was funny, but it did make me feel at home. We had some confusion with our check in, because we had reserved the two rooms separately, one with Hilton points and one with Amex points, so it was difficult linking the two reservations. I had anticipated that, and tried calling in advance to explain, but we had to work it out when we arrived in person. This led to some difficulty in getting a package delivered later, but that sort of thing is to be expected in a big hotel. The staff were very attentive and eager to help, and everyone spoke excellent, perfectly fluent English, as I would have expected in a Hilton hotel. The concierge staff were helpful in giving us directions and making suggestions. The hotel has a big breakfast buffet in the lobby, which had many Western and Japanese selections. Our kids really loved it. There were several restaurants on site, which we did not get to sample, although two kids downed by jet lag did get room service dinner one night, and it met with their approval. We did peek in on one of the restaurants, I think it was a Chinese restaurant, and it looked very nice. The hotel runs a frequent shuttle bus to and from Shinjuku Station, which is very convenient. It is a good way to get around. We had planned to take the Romancecar Train from Shinjuku Station to Hakone, which is one reason we chose this hotel. Unfortunately, the day we were scheduled to take the train, there was an accident, and the train was cancelled, but we got there on a regular commuter train. Best laid plans and all. The hotel also sits above an underground shopping arcade, and the Nishi-Shinjuku subway station, which is also quite convenient. There was a coffee shop there, where we got coffee one morning, and a convenience store as well (maybe a Family Mart?) The subway station is not directly below the hotel. It is at least a 10 minute or so walk underground, but it worked out well for traveling by subway around Tokyo, which is very large. Shinjuku Chuo Park is a short walk from the hotel. It has a shrine, a waterfall, playgrounds, sculptures, etc. My husband enjoyed running there in the morning, and we enjoyed walking there as a family. The hotel is convenient to many other interesting sites. Overall, we had a great experience at this hotel and would stay again. I highly recommend it.","South Orange, New Jersey","jeannie2nyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Orange, New Jersey</strong>",66,4.0
