Both rooms I stayed are with balcony, lovely view there. It’s opposite to Tokyo Olympic stadium and Shinjuku Gyoen, easy access to nature in Tokyo.The hotel is with simple gym, laundry/ dry machine. With good breakfast buffet offer . A rooftop equipped to enjoy the neighbour view. Close to metro station Kokuritsu-Kyōgijō exit of Toei Oedo line.Some notes for reference if you have concern:1. Not a hotel near many restaurants, convenient stores: again, it’s in downtown Tokyo but surrounded by stadium/ parks, not entertainments. The hotel is with vending machine to provide small snacks/ drinks.2. The hotel is more designed for leisure time not for business traveller. The room is with nice tea table but not with working desk. If you need to sit properly for desk works, you can use common room on 2nd floor.In general, I like this hotel and wish to visit again next time in Tokyo","Hong Kong, China","JL23WG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",0,5.0

We were tourists and wanted to see all the sights, its location is in a quiet area, but with a subway and JR rail station within a few min walking distance so that was perfect. The restaurant downstairs was incredible for breakfast and dinner. Would absolutely come back next time.","Adelaide, Australia","jsnoz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",3,5.0

It has a subway right beside (30 sec walk!) on the pink oedo line (stop is called kokuritsu-kyogijo station) or a casual half hour walk to Shibuya central. it's nice and quiet in a lovely suburban area, the staff are SO polite and friendly, the rooms are small (smaller than most rooms we have stayed in - there isn't alot of space for luggage etc) but it's efficient, the shower is amazing, amienties great, gym and public baths on 3rd floor, open rooftop with beanbags for watching sunset, amazing buffet breakfast (high standard), great coffee & bakery, modern sleek restaurant for evening meal but the highlight for me is the view from our balcony of mount Fuji and the sunsets. The hotel feels brand new and I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting toyko. Great value for money too!",United Kingdom,"Beauclerc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

We were so pleased we picked this hotel and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The hotel is right opposite the new Olympic stadium and two minutes walk from Kokuitsu-Kyogijo Station (Oedo Line) and 7minutes from Sendagaya Station(Chou Line). Additionally you have Shinjuku Gyoen National garden close by and can walk easily to Shinjuku if required. Hotel rooms are spotlessly clean and reasonably spacious for Tokyo. Very modern features in the room and we were very comfortable. Breakfast is great in the restaurant downstairs and the onsen and gym were very good. Staff are helpful and friendly and accommodated our request to change rooms to one facing Shinjuku. We will definitely stay here again.,"Greater London, United Kingdom","TR4prez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater London, United Kingdom</strong>",96,5.0

However, its very affordable and roomy. This was the largest space we had in all our trips to Tokyo! Staff is helpful. Large lobby with a coffeeshop. Its a 5 min walk to the train station and not too far from main parts/attractions. Our room had a balcony and we got a glimpse of Mt Fuji on a clear day. Would return!

Walking distance to Meiji Jingu shrine. Ideal location if you want a break from the noise and crowd. Comfy beds, good size bathroom. Coin laundry (500Y including detergent) and vending machines on the 2nd floor. Breakfast buffet includes western and Japanese food but dishes are the same for 3 days. Would help to have some variation. Receptionists are friendly and helpful. We shipped a medium-size suitcase to Kyoto for <2000Y. Perfect hotel for our first leg of the trip to recover from jet lag and not break the bank.","Santa Clara, California","SFBayArea_Mom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clara, California</strong>",29,5.0

With both a train line and subway nearby and only two stops to Shinjuku, it's easy to get around Tokyo from this hotel. The hotel is next to several parks and feels like a little oasis in the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Beautifully appointed, this hotel is highly recommended.","Brisbane, Australia","Timotei20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",13,5.0

It took us a while to find a nice hotel that wasn’t outrageously expensive. To our luck, we found this brand new accommodation that opened weeks prior.We got there via public transport from the airport which was relatively easy to find since the hotel is located about 1 minute walk from a station.They upgraded us upon arrival to a larger room with a beautiful city view.The hotel room is very smartly designed to fit in everything you need to a Tokyo size hotel room.The hotel is really nice and clean for the value, they have a nice small gym, Japanese pool and laundry services. It is within walking distance to many restaurants and the major city park. It only took us about 15 minutes by train to shinjuku. I would give this hotel 5/5 however, when we asked a service member at the front desk for a water bottle (which we asked the day before to another member who gave it kindly with no issues) the front desk employee was extremely rude and unprofessional, denying us a water bottle.Other than that, it was a great hotel and would recommend it if you are staying in Tokyo and want easy access to Shibuya and shinjuku.","Vancouver, Canada","Jordanaexplores</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",5,4.0

As a prime hotel for the Olympics, it is clear MGH have invested in this is a flagship property. Without any activity at the stadium the location feels relatively quiet and secluded compared to other areas of downtown Tokyo, yet is very easily accessible; it sits above Kokuritsu-Kyogijo Station (Oedo line) and is within walking distance to both Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku, etc. We paid just over £200/night for the modern 38sqm corner room with wraparound balcony, which probably represents the best value possible within the Yamanote line. We loved the spacious dressing room area adjacent to the large shower room and closet. It was too cold during our stay to enjoy the large balcony, but in the summer would be a great place to sit with a drink and watch the skyline (and Mt. Fuji in the distance). My only criticism would be the toilet room, which has floor-to-ceiling frosted glass and became very warm even with sparse winter sun shining on it - I suspect they will end up fitting blinds in these rooms to help keep them cool in the summer.The public areas are full of interesting artwork and decor, and the hotel was even drawing interest from non-guests visiting the newly completed New National Stadium. The rooftop terrace was a nice bonus, though the views were similar to that any of the high corner rooms on the south side enjoyed. The baths were clean and very similar to those I've experienced at other MGH properties. The breakfast offering was very reasonable, with the alternative of some tasty bakery items available alongside coffee for take-out. We didn't have time to try the restaurant in the evening, but their tasting menu caught my eye (and again appeared great value at ~5000JPY/person). As far as I could tell - but could be wrong - the Deluxe Twin corner rooms were on the SW and SE corners of the hotel (with views over parkland, the Olympic village and Mt. Fuji in the distance), whilst the slightly less expensive Superior Corner rooms were located on the NW and NE overlooking a fairly busy road and train line. I would therefore recommend going for the rooms on the South side if possible.",,286mattr,7,5.0
