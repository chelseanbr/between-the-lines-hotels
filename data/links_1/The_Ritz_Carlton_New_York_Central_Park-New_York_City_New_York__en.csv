We were there for Valentine's Day night and wanted to celebrate our engagement there, plus our first date out away from our newborn baby. We loved the room and enjoyed the (way overpriced) drinks at Contour. We were surprised that, for a category 8 with a known name, their in-room dining food was so basic and dull and there were limited options for t.v. (especially no pay per view), so it wasn't very thrilling. But the worst part was our experience with check-out. The night before, I called the front desk for the opportunity for a later check-out and he gave me 2pm and I agreed. So my hubby and I planned our day accordingly to that time to leave. The next morning, I got called twice from the front desk wondering if we were extending our stay, to which I told them about our agreed 2pm check-out. Later, they called me and told me I had to check out in 30min, so we rushed out completely unprepared. If I had known there was no true availability for a later check-out, that would've been fine. The short notice that we needed to be out felt like I was another sheep in a herd that needed to shove out.",,mycharlieamor,1,3.0

By day two the odor was so overwhelming when we complained all the did was bring in a air purifier that did nothing to filter out the odor. On day three we requested to be moved to another room and were told that would not be a possibility for another day or two. My boyfriend and I could barely sleep and I had a horrible headache. When they finally were able to move us we were moved to a much smaller room and just overall big disappointment. Managment was rather rude as well because the room was booked under my boyfriends name and kept saying we will speak to him about any requests despite my name being on the room. He was there for meetings and was upset they were treating me that way when I was trying to resolve the problem for both of us.,,lalacey22,6,2.0

It was so horrible that I had a reservation at the Ritz in Washington DC to spend New Years Eve that I cancelled because I did not want to take the risk of having the same treatment. My family comes to NYC every Christmas for the past 15 years. We spend it at The New York Palace where we have amazing relationships and a wonderful time. Including with Becky Hubbard who is the GM at the Palace and used to work at this Ritz. I received as one of my Christmas gifts to spend two nights at this hotel because I wanted to venture out a little from my comfort zone and try something new. We had reserved two rooms with club lounge access. The day before our arrival we went to the hotel just to meet the wonderful Kamal and Kylam for the first time. They were so nice to us. They told us to come around 10 am because our rooms were ready the next day. We arrived around noon and only one room was ready and the other room was going to be ready around 3pm. And that’s when our issues started. We had to store all of our family’s luggage in my room to wait for the other room. Around 3:30pm the room was ready. We went to the room and it had a horrible smell and the layout of the room was completely different than mine. My mom is highly allergic and immediately felt she could not stay in that room. We went downstairs to charge the room and Ella told us that they did not have a single room in e whole building that was similar layout and she only had one room that would be available around 7pm. Yes 7pm!!!!!! Also she began to tell me that we did not even have that category of rooms and we were giving an update.. we never asked for upgrades it was giving to us because the people from the Palace recommended us to the Ritz since we are VIP guests over there. We had until 5pm to decide if we were going to stay or not in the rooms so my mom went back to the Palace and of course even though “there were no room available” they were able to get us our rooms at the Towers. It’s all about relationships and amazing customer service at the Palace. So I tell Ella around 4:30 that we are going back to the Palace since we were not willing to wait until 7pm to see the other room. She proceeded to tell me in front of the concierge desk in front of Celso and Daniel and Suzanna that she was going to charge me for the room she gave me earlier. I was shocked !! We never used the room!!! I took pictures and video of the untouched room. So I called her manager Justin who obviously has no clue about customer service and he told me the same thing. That I had to pay for the room I never used!! Then he said he will give 50% off the rate. If money was an issue I wouldn’t have reserved two rooms for over$ 4,000 !! It’s how I was treated he wasn’t even apologetic !! The Ritz should have paid me for the day I spent there waiting for the rooms to be ready since it was said they were going to be ready at 10am!! Celso and Daniel and Suzanna were horrified and so apologetic!! I am so glad they watched the whole thing happening!! I cried out of anger and disappointment .. I am so glad I went back to the Palace!! I am waiting for the GM to call me. Let’s see if he will deliver the Ritz service that I mostly deserve. I also contacted the Marriott headquarters to bring this issue to them. I was never so mistreated in a hotel. I am so glad the concierge was a witness of this horrible experience .This situation caused me to cancel my trip to the Ritz in Washington. If you like to be well treated do not go to this property ever!! Incompetent staff far away from a Ritz way of treating guests who are spending over 1,500 dollars a night.

We heard doors slamming at midnight on Saturday night, as well as people running up and down the halls Sunday morning.The nicest part of the hotel was the front door staff, who were very helpful getting cabs, and the hot chocolate in the early evenings is a nice touch.All in all, not my idea of a ""spectacular Ritz Carlton experience""...a Sheraton maybe, but not a Ritz or Four Season's.

They also said that they would like to leave a gift for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find a wonderful ""recovery bag"" in my room upon returning from dinner. I also needed an early breakfast which was delivered promptly to the room at the time I requested. I desparately wanted to be at ease before my race and the staff at the Ritz did everything within their power to make it so. For that, I thank you!",,mistachristian,2,5.0

The basic rooms are small, and our room, like many if not most others, has a view of a brick wall and other guest windows on all sides and in close proximity. Walls seem thin. Nothing stands out as remarkable. They don’t honor upgrade requests for Marriott Platinum Elite members. We were told somewhat haughtily that this is the one Ritz Carlton location that does not. Also just tried to find out how to get coffee. There is no Nespresso, tea bags or otherwise in the room and they take away lobby coffee at 10am. We were told they have a nespresso set up available for a $39 charge.... unreal when you spend $1000 for a room. These are provided in other Ritz Carlton’s and much humbler hotels routinely without cost. I would recommend looking for better options — there are many in midtown Manhattan. We stayed last at the St Regis and it was much superior. It’s a shame when a brand relies on its name and address alone.

Our previously three stays were very good experiences. We are currently staying in room #616 through this Saturday (unless I check-out and go to another hotel). Being a loyal Titanium Elite member with over 800 nights spent in 5 star hotels with Marriott & partners, this was by far one of the most offensive experiences I can remember. Here are the reasons I believe this hotel and staff fall below the standards of Ritz Carlton. 1. I was offended that the front desk informed me if I wanted to use the Executive lounge that it would be an extra $250. per night. I informed him that as a Titanium Elite, I have never been requested to pay an up-charge for lounge access at a Ritz Carlton & St. Regis, ever. He informed “we normally charge $500-$750 up-charge per night night in peak season.” I guess August 27th is not peak season…  2. I was eligible for an upgrade with suite night rewards, but was informed by the same gentleman that they did not have availability. I understand, however, I can look on the reservations portal and there are rooms available for sale in every category… 3. I took a cold shower for the 4 minutes until the water was finally warming but he time I was finishing. I understand, it's an old building but we are paying prime money for prime real estate. I do not think a Ritz Carlton should subject their guest to such a discomfort!We have stayed at this property several times over times over the past few years and have always been upgraded without even using my Bonvoy Suite night rewards. To be given a room in the back of the hotel on the lowest floor (which my app preferences always request a high floor) is just not taking the customers preferences into account or even looking at the customer reservations. This is very far below the Ritz Carlton standard or really any 5 star in a conceptive market like NYC. I did not raise an issue with the customer service, but feel the front desk decisions will most likely cause me to take my 14 nights stay per year in NYC away from this hotel to a competitor in the future.",,5StarTraveler777,0,1.0

We decided on an Avenue room with partial view and it was great -- from the bed, the view was of the Park. Check-in, concierge, and room service were all very kind. We had told the Ritz in advance that it was our first night out of town from our six-month-old baby and they left a precious stuffed animal in our room for her with a kind card. I was so touched by the thoughtfulness. The bed was luxurious as was the bathroom. The room was a bit smaller but plenty of room for a night and the view was so restful and pleasing. We had one snafu in that the restaurant recommended by the concierge, Benoit, was a dud. It must have gone downhill since the Ritz recommended -- we were served $21 champagne cocktails in a plastic glasses (and the cocktail wasn't mixed, in ice, very strange), with sub-par, cold, and flavorless food. However, when we shared our experience on our return, the concierge bought us drinks and desserts in the Ritz bar, and the drinks (and awesome bartender!) more than made up for the experience. Also Benoit sent pastries in apology (a little strange to get burnt croissants at 10 pm but again with the great service!).We were made to feel like valued guests by all of the staff there.

That’s a pretty great product.We only stayed 1 night in June 2019 at the Central Park location, but from that stay, the room was great. It’s as quiet and solid as a bank vault. By NYC standards, ours was a very large room (and we had the smallest sq ft room category) and impeccably clean. All the usual accolades of a luxury property: well appointed, fantastic mattress and pillows, thoughtful amenities.And of course, you’re right on Central Park South, so the location is fantastic.My only observation on a short-coming: the lobby is devoid of anything interesting, or even anything useful. There’s no character (or utility) to the lobby: Only 2 lonely, awkwardly-placed chairs in the entire lobby to sit for a second. The front desk has 3 stations, and 3 people were being helped and 2 waiting in front of us. 6-7 minutes later, there were still 2 people waiting in front of us. And nowhere to sit.

While we went out to eat and got room service, ot was completely unnecessary for those that would prefer to eat 3 meals a day in the lounge. Anyone that says you have to go outside of the US to experience an exceptional club lounge in a hotel needs to try this one. The staff was incredible, especially Lazar in the club lounge. I'd like to go into a bit more detail in this post, starting with the dining (focusing on the club lounge cuisine), moving on to the location, room, and price.The food:There was plenty of variety offered as well as some things that remained consistent where we were glad to see them on a daily basis. It was easy to get small portions, which allowed for more variety within a single meal than if the servings were bigger. They had caviar the first night in the lounge. They had rotating things once during our stay like short ribs, large shrimp, fish, etc. They often had a wide selection of cold meats, raw vegetables, raw fruit, dried fruit, nuts, crackers, and cheeses. They probably had fresh fruit, cookies, and scones on a daily basis while we were there. The dessert spread they had available every night was incredible, with some consistent items that were great like chocolate fondue with strawberries and some excellent chocolate that we saw at least a few times and lots of variety as well. They had a selection of wine and you could ask a waiter for additional options that were not visible. They had a nice tea selection as well as plenty of options for coffee lovers. While they didn't have sparkling cider, Lazar even ordered some just for me from outside the hotel, treatment that I have never gotten at any lounge.Everything that never or virtually never left: at least 9 varieties of candy, red and green apples, oranges, teas, wines, coffee variants, sodas, bottled water, and cookies.I only went to breakfast once (we did more room service for breakfast, which was great), but when I went on a Friday options included the following (the only meal I am going to go in detail on):Small muffins with either nutella, apple, or raspberry preserves (excellent).There was chocolate and plain croissants, sliced bread, and 4 kinds of bagels as well as a few kinds of cream cheese.There were 6 kinds of cereal, oatmeal and options to include with oatmeal like golden raisins and brown sugar. There was skim milk, whole milk, grapefruit juice and orange juice. There was a selection of cheeses and dried fruits. There was salmon and a few toppings to add to it. One egg option included a baked blend of eggs, ham, and green onions. The other was zucchini, peppers, cheddar, and egg whites. There were boiled eggs with shells removed, There were blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries. There was sliced cantaloupe, honey dew, and pineapple. There was a yogurt parfait and excellent muesli. There was cold roast beef, ham, olive tapenade, and pickles. As always there were apples, bottled water, wine, sodas, teas, and various coffee derived options.Lunch was varieties of sandwiches, soup, salad, and other things as well to compliment those like veggies, tapenade, apples, cookies, and chips. Among sandwiches my favorite was probably the hot cheddar and pastrami. Snacks included things like chips, nuts, and scones. Of course snacks were lighter than during breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The scones were fantastic and they might have had them every day and you could add options like devonshire cream, apple butter, or apricot jam.Dinner was differing main courses (i.e. short ribs, lasagna, etc. none of which we ever had twice in 6 days as far as I can remember) in addition to cold meats, crackers, cheeses, salad, dried fruits. Large shrimp cocktails were a nice side one night.Dessert presentation and taste were incredible every night. Even if you are going out to eat while staying there a lot, at least come back for the dessert. There was lots of variety within a night and from one night to the next. Lemon blueberry tart, fine chocolate, chocolate panna cotta, strawberry banana parfait, chocolate coconut mousse, lemon tart, excellent macaroons (especially their raspberry macaroons), and strawberry champagne mousse were just some of what we saw. Location:Being able to walk out of the hotel and enter Central Park was incredible. My wife and I loved walks there during our stay. There was a lot to do within a short distance, so whether taking Uber or walking, it was easy to get to where we wanted to be. Uber for us made a lot more sense than renting a car with the high cost of parking in NYC.Room:It was clean, it was comfortable, it was beautiful, and was wonderful for our stay. The view on our side was poor (maybe 20 ft from another building with what may have been an alley underneath), although if there had been a view, noise was a concern since we were in NYC. You can always spend more at the Ritz if you really want a view. We had a free upgrade option via my Gold status to a better view but we opted for the lesser view due to other factors about the room we liked better in the room we stayed in.In NYC rooms tend to be small, and while we were in a basic room there, it was never too small for us. Square footage was clearly advertised in booking and for those that want more room, there are upgraded room possibilities that are much bigger there.Price:For the kind of experience my wife and I had, from the outstanding service like Lazar in the lounge, to the fantastic room, to the ideal location, to the best lounge experience I have ever had, the price was absolutely worth it.Our stay was >95% on points (Marriott points for the room while it was still Category 7 before they came out with Category 8 that they converted it to) and Capital One purchase eraser for the spa, lounge access, room service, etc. The only exception was $ tips. I thought it was a solid use of Marriott points, especially because I got the 5th night free. Because of the points transfers now possible with Capital One, especially as they slowly roll out transfer promos, I probably wouldn't use purchase eraser again. Pictures included in this review are of the club lounge cuisine. The one exception is the chocolate covered strawberries sitting in a bed of dark chocolate with a marzipan label that said, ""Happy 1st Anniversary"" that greeted us as we got settled into our beautiful room.","Hampton, Virginia","AdamBGarrett</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hampton, Virginia</strong>",5,5.0

Right from the cake and macaroons and happy birthday banner in my daughter's room, reservations at the best restaurants and even sending me a foam roller in my room for my stiff back - it was all thought of and done. Not to mention free complimentary water sippers that serve as a great memory. The location is the very best in NYC. The shopping is just round the corner and central park at the doorstep.

Using points and status we were entitled to a room upgrade but the room was not ready when we arrived. An interior courtyard room had been made up and as we put a premium on getting into the room and then getting on our way for our lunch reservation we selected the courtyard room. The room itself was newly refurbished and up to RC standards. However, the courtyard view was uninspiring to say the least. For a frame of reference for those who has seen the Alfred Hitchcock thriller ""Rear Window"", looking into the courtyard was like looking into the window of the apartment across the way in the movie where the murder was committed. Needless to say we kept the curtains closed during our entire stay. Having said this we willingly chose the room so this is really just an observation and not a critique of the Ritz property. We stayed on points so we could not use our club level certificate but looked into the club lounge and determined to use the club level certificate on our next visit as the lounge looked comfortable and well stocked.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Bob S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",5,5.0

When one stays at a luxury property, one presumes a certain level of hospitality. I arrived and while the doorman was helping another, he literally grabbed my bag without even a welcome. Enter hotel, no upgrade for Gold status. Okay and no problem. Enter door man who left bag by my side. No one offered to take my bag to the room. I was given lowest room category with a view of several brick walls, no morning light. I walk into the bathroom and WC was not checked before arrival!!! Disgusting, and that is all I will say about that. Offered another room, upgraded, (where was this at check in)??? but who wants to repack and unpack after a long day of travel? I go to bed and am awakened at 4 AM to an alarm that I did not set, lamenting the one chance I had to sleep in. Went to breakfast and had to get my own coffee in the restaurant, and was not asked for a refresher until I left 45 minutes later. The bill did not allow for the customer to tip freely; it was automatically added. Ostensibly, the server had to get an income and was not willing to help his only table in the restaurant. That said, the hotel update was enjoyable, the ambience appealing. I was offered a coupon to try this place again but why waste my time when the Big Apple has so much to offer? Oberoi Hotels, PLEASE open in NYC and teach the amateurs the true meaning of hospitality.

We used Marriott points for a 5 night stay and it was amazing! I had messaged the hotel prior to our arrival to make sure we were in a 2 queen room and I let them know we would be celebrating both of our boys birthdays. The 2 queen room was much larger than I expected and the bathroom was huge!! The largest I have had in NYC by far!! The concierge had surprised the boys with balloons and cookies along with an Empire State Building chocolate (My oldest’s favorite part. He requested another on our last night at the Star Lounge as a dessert and of course, they delivered!) We didn’t require a lot of assistance but anytime I did need anything (bandaids for a kiddo scrape, or extra bath salts) they were extremely quick to respond! Everyone was so friendly and even staff members who we just exchanged hellos on the elevator, knew our name. They really are spectacular. The doormen were all so friendly. My kids especially enjoyed seeing Felix most days. He always made them feel special. We had a couple evenings in the Star Lounge for desserts and drinks and enjoyed the experience. The location is great! We loved being able to walk outside right into the park! The hotel also had a complimentary house car (a very nice Mercedes with an even nicer driver) that we used some evenings to take us to our midtown destination. Such a nice option to have! The Ritz Carlton Central Park gave us a phenomenal first family vacation! I hope we get to return one day!

Nothing proves this rule more than this property. I stayed here many years ago and now just stayed recently. Things have changed (to say the least). Gone is the elegance, grace, and ""old world magic"" of the pre-Marriott Ritz Carlton. This is a very nice hotel, but it feels like it is part of a big chain. We stayed in a ""deluxe"" one bedroom (couldn't tell what made it ""deluxe""). The hotel is well built and the rooms are of good quality (but they are on the small side for a ""five star"" property). Our room was nice, but felt a little cramped (by ""5-star"" standards). The furnishings are of high quality but they are the pretty much the same as you will find at any Ritz these days (and the higher quality JW Marriott properties). Our room had a spectacular view of Central Park. The hotel has an enviable location and a decent gym (didn't see any pool). We had lounge access. Very good food but very Marriott. When I stayed here way back when, caviar and stone crab claws were served club level--not anymore--but still good. Also, there is supposedly still a dress code in the club but these days it is not enforced (I actually saw a guest in bare feet and not one of the many staff members said a word to him). The service at this property is solid, but not over the top. There were a couple of little flaws. They kept removing my daughter's rollaway when we asked them not to (and one night they made it up with dirty blankets). But, as soon as we brought the flaws to their attention, they fixed them immediately (and most things service-wise were fine). Again, nothing wrong with this hotel (actually quite good and amazing location). I do not give it 5 circles because I believe there are better brands in this price range (Auberge, Four Seasons, Relais properties, etc). However you could certainly do much worse (I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental in NYC and that was a horrible experience). This is a fine choice but not the magical, old world experience of Ritz Carlton past. Also, they DO NOT honor platinum Marriott status at Ritz Carltons. I have totally accepted this fact, but it seems like (from the other reviews) that many are bitter about this. Get over it people. You can use the Marriott points to book rooms, but you get NOOOOO special recognition.

We booked our stay online through the Marriott website, and we remitted Marriott rewards points for a complimentary stay. (This was perhaps our best use of points ever, since the room value was upwards of $800 per night!) A few weeks before we arrived, we received an email from guest services inquiring about our preferences and plans, and we mentioned that we were visiting to celebrate our joint milestone 50th birthdays. (We had already booked our restaurants and theatre tickets on our own, or they would have helped arrange those activities.)The Ritz-Carlton Central Park is located in a Beaux Arts building on the southern perimeter of the park on West 59th Street. (Although it occupies the site of the 1930 former St. Moritz Hotel, the building has since been owned by Harry Helmsley, Donald Trump, and Ian Schrager.) From the moment we stepped out of the taxi, staff greeted us by name. I thought that my spouse had provided our surname, and conversely, he thought that I had given it, but neither was true. Our guess is that the doorman/valet sneaked a peek at the luggage tag on our suitcase and then passed our name on to all other staff that we encountered. It was a lovely arrival experience!The property has an on-site restaurant (Auden Bistro and Bar), afternoon tea (in the Star Lounge), a La Prairie Spa, fitness center, and small sundry shop, in addition to club level accommodations that enjoy a separate private lounge. Many of the hotel’s nearly 260 rooms and suites afford either city or park views. (We were thrilled that the two windows in our standard room allowed us views of Sixth Avenue and a glimpse into Central Park!)Our standard room had a hallway (which was the most convenient place to open the luggage stand for our small suitcase) that led into the main room. We were blown away by the first thing that we saw: two huge silver Mylar helium balloons with the numbers 5 and 0 to mark our special occasion! The balloons were positioned between the comfy king-size bed (with a nightstand on each side) and the small sitting area (with its tiny sofa, chair, and coffee table [which held a plate of sweets plated to mark our special occasion]). The side of the room opposite the bed contained a built-in unit that included two smallish closets (neither was long enough to hang a calf-length coat) and a shelf that held the TV, with drawers beneath (one of which held a pull-out refrigerated drawer). The marble bathroom was large by Manhattan standards, with a vanity for dual sinks, ample shelving, complimentary toiletries (even men’s dress shirt collar stays were offered!), and a big glass shower. (Note that our room did not have a soaking bathtub; in retrospect, we may have been assigned a semi-handicapped room, since the shower seemed as if it could be rolled into.) Textiles incorporated muted and tasteful earth tones, with creative and memorable wallpaper that showcased clouds. We loved the personal business cards that we could give to acquaintances advertising that we were “In Residence” at the hotel!We loved our stay at the Ritz-Carlton Central Park!

My wife and I wanted to take out kids up to NYC to see the tree at Rockefeller Center and so when I went to book the room I knew we were going to give the Ritz a try. Since I'm a Platinum Premier with Marriott I decided to book a room on points (60,000) for a Saturday night and do it right. When you book a room on points all you are able to book is a standard room which was fine for my family and I. Normally I get upgraded at Marriotts but I was also well aware that Ritz's normally do not upgrade award stays so I was not expecting one. Upon arrival though I was able to at least upgrade our view and get a room facing 6th Ave with a partial view of Central Park. We were very happy with that! One thing you have to realize about hotels in NYC is that unless you are staying in a suite, standard rooms are not very large. The standard room size at the Ritz is roughly 450 square feet so it's fine for a family of four for a night but for a long stay you probably want to make sure where you book has larger rooms. As for the service I have to say the employees we encountered were all very nice and very helpful. I expected this at the Ritz and they delivered. For instance when the horse and carriage ride I booked with the Concierge Desk was 10 minutes late to pick my family and I up, one of the head Concierge's, Keoni, made sure to apologize and get my family some cups of hot chocolate to keep us warm on the ride. That was very nice and we appreciated it very much. I must also say Felix the doorman was wonderful and greeted us each and every time we went outside or came back in. He also was very apologetic to us when the valet took some time to retrieve our car and made sure to have our car loaded with our bags and with bottles of water in the console before we got in the car to drive back home. They have great people and Keoni and Felix are two great examples of that. Even while we were waiting for our car another employee brought my 4 year old son a large stuffed animal Lion to play with out of the blue! He did it just because he wanted to. These are the reasons why we will certainly return to the Ritz and stay again. Their people make the experience wonderful. Add to the fact they have one of the best locations in the city right on Central Park and you have the makings for a great trip to NYC.

I'm a Marriott Platinum member, but as most Marriott Platinums already know, Ritz Carlton doesn't give much for benefits to Marriott elites, no suite upgrades, no lounge, or breakfast but that is besides the point.Upon arrival to the hotel, I realized there is no actual lobby/parking for exclusive hotel guest drop off. It's just a sidewalk entrance with minimal signage. The location is great next to central park but come on, a 5 star hotel upward of $800 a night for a lousy sidewalk entrance? Are you serious?If you choose to stop reading here, I don't blame you but there's worst time to come. Like I said I didn't expect much for an upgrade but Iiterally got nothing. Why do you treat Marriott elites this way? I could go next door to JW for half the price and could've gotten a suite almost guaranteed.It could've been the fact I booked with reward points, and thought long and hard about extending an extra night but ultimately decided not to. I'm glad I didn't.I got to the hotel pretty early and the staff said they will call me when my room is ready. Walked around central park and had to come back to ping the front desk for an update and he said ""15 minutes"" I knew the room was vacant as informed by the front desk earlier, it just needed housekeeping and they had 3 full hours to do it.Upon ""checking in"" they did not say ANYTHING about Marriott elite nor anything about the welcome gift. They gave me my card keys and told me where the elevator was.The elevators are TINY. It fits 6 people max. The decor of the hotel tries to be classical but it simply looks old and painted/veneered over. The room was decent sized but half of it was allocated to an excessively large bathroom - most of which is wasted space and could've been used more for the room. The doors in the bathroom didn't even close properly. You had to push super hard to get the door latch to clear the gap.The beds had these black Lutron switches taped to the post. They were hard to find and also once you found them, just plain unsightly. These switches simply show a lack of thought in the renovation. You can get these for $49.99 at Best Buy, probably less since Black Friday is coming up. Nobody wants to see these in one of the most expensive hotels in NYC. The view was other people's hotel rooms/apartments. It was just plain awkward looking outside so we kept the blinds down for majority of the stay.About service, it was fine except they threw away 2 tubes of fresh toothpaste the day after we opened them. Like I get it, rich people stay here, but even Jeff Bezos wouldn't throw away a tube of Colgate after using it for a day.I didn't bother dealing with front desk when I checked out, I just did it on the TV and left. This was my first stay in NYC and first stay at a Ritz Carlton property. Terrible first impressions. To all Marriott elites out there: STAY AWAY. Go to JW for less, hell I got a better experience in the first 30 seconds of checking in at Renaissance Midtown than this place. I honestly don't see why anyone would pay so much for this place. Maybe you need to see the club lounge to enjoy it. Maybe you need a suite.Some SEO tags so you guys can find this review: Marriott Platinum Premier, SPG Platinum, Gold, Silver.

First the good aspects of the hotel:It is in a great location, right on the park, and with easy access to the theater district and mid-town New York. I don't like big hotels, and The Ritz feels more like a boutique hotel. Check-in and service were excellent. The bed was big and comfy. Good charging capabilities throughout the room, including bedside USB chargers. Fast free internet for frequent stayers. The bathroom was big and well-equipped, and one of my favorite features... they had a really nice hand steamer in the room that was perfect for a wrinkled suit.The not-so-good. My king room, while in great condition, was on the small side and very dark, with an inside courtyard view of a brick wall. My smoke detector malfunctioned early in the morning and woke me up. Unlike other Ritz Carleton's I have stayed in - this room does not have a coffee or Nespresso maker (the Ritz should make that standard). I had stayed at the Ritz Denver two weeks earlier - and it was a much nicer room. It was a bit noisy. I was already up because of the smoke detector, but the hallway noise was loud.So while it is a nice room, and a lovely hotel, for the price it did not compare favorably to the Park Hyatt that is just a few blocks away.

I have been staying at this Manhattan oasis for 15 years now. From the moment I arrive (when I am warmly welcomed by name by the affable doormen) to the end of my stay (when the front desk staff makes sure my stay was a smooth one), I am always made to feel that I am a valued guest. And I don’t think this is just because I am a longtime visitor. Rather, I’ve noticed that all the other guests are treated just the same as me, whether they be first-time visitors or returning regulars like me. The hotel recently underwent a top-to-bottom “refreshing”, and the new décor is elegantly stylish and sumptuous without being stuffy. And of course, the midtown location can’t be beat (directly across from Central Park and within steps from Fifth Avenue). The ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz are extraordinary – starting with those affable doormen I previously mentioned. The bellmen are prompt, helpful, and friendly; the front desk staff is totally professional and always anticipates my needs; the concierges are first-class; the Club Lounge personnel provide the utmost in service; the La Prairie spa front desk staff and providers are all outstanding; the in-room dining folks (and selections) exceed my experiences at all other hotels; the housekeeping staff is top-notch (twice daily); and the managers who are often circulating in the public areas are not only perceptive but also engaging. For me, what sets this hotel apart is the sincere and genuine personal attention that awaits when one enters its doors. Family members or friends often accompany me on my stays at the Ritz Central Park, and all of them have remarked how attentive the staff is to their guests. For example, I treated my niece and her friend to a summer trip recently to celebrate their college graduations and the friend’s birthday. Upon first entering their room after arrival, the young ladies discovered a “goodie plate” congratulating them on their accomplishments and the friend’s special day. Over the years I’ve experienced countless other examples of “above-and-beyond” hospitality, from stocking my quarters with my favorite Texas-based soft drink to leaving a Broadway show cast recording as a souvenir following an evening at the theatre. This level of attention, the hotel’s ambience, and the marvelous staff will keep me returning to the Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park for years to come.","Dallas, Texas","UncleVictor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",21,5.0

I have my go-to hotels. This is my first time at The Ritz in NYC. I typically stay in Ritz hotels in other locations. I am a Platinum member and booked with points. When I booked my room I booked a park view room with club access. I enjoy the club at all of the Ritz hotels. They did not provide what I booked at check-in, so I came downstairs and they recognized that they had not given me the room I booked. Make sure you have your reservation handy to prove what you booked. I had to show it a couple of times. We were arriving from Paris and a long flight. It was already late when we were checking in, after 6:30 pm. I was mistaken about booking a club room. But since they did not have a park view room ready we had to wait so they escorted us to the club. It was not until 8:30 that our room was ready. Not sure why the room required over 2 hours at the time we checked in to get ready, but it did. The room was on the 18th floor and had a nice entryway, coat closet, small couch, nice wardrobes for your clothes, wonderful bed and..... That central park view. Yes, it was dark but oh the view. Our room was provided with a telescope. All of the lights surrounding the park. The lights in the park. We enjoyed going to sleep to the view, waking up to the view, & enjoying the view with room service. Our room was a nice size, separate tub & shower, 2 sinks, separate water closet.Yes, the water was brown when I started the tub but I ran it for 2 minutes and it was fine. Water pressure in the shower was nice.The club was wonderful. Usually, the Club is on a higher floor so no super cool views. But, the food offerings, wine, and staff were wonderful! We were able to get 1:00 checkout. I would have preferred past 2 but I didn't insist. Room service was very nice. They do take about 30 minutes to pick up your room service table so call as soon as your done as it takes quite a bit of space in the room. The hotel is quite pricey. The view is why. If you don't have the view or an exceptional room, I can't say the $1000+ a night is worth it. But, if you book the view. It's worth every penny.","Austin, Texas","djveloz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",120,4.0

We were coming in for a fall weekend, and booked the room a few months in advance. We specifically asked for a high floor park view. The reservation's desk said they couldn't guarantee, but given how far in advance we were making the reservation there shouldn't be a problem. When we checked in we were given a park view room on the third floor - lowest floor in the hotel. Clearly this isn't the end of the world, and we still had a nice stay. The rooms are beautiful and it is a great location, but how we ended up with a view of the street is beyond me. The rooms cost quite a bit, and for the price, our view was mediocre at best. There are other hotels in that location - maybe it's time to give them a try.

The service and interaction with the staff was as expected—an excellent standard that shows only the best of the best Ritz staff are generally there. The location is great—right across the street from Central Park, easy walk to numerous nice restaurants and shops. The facilities were well-maintained, elegant, and beautifully ornate (some of the molding and fixtures were splendid). We didn’t get a room with a great view, but it was quiet and we thoroughly enjoyed the comfort/contrast—after walking around in the hustle and bustle of NY all day, especially Central Park the same day as a huge concert event, it felt like we were transported somewhere else when we were back in the room—quiet, calm. The only negatives was that there was not much space downstairs in the lobby area, there was no pool/hot tub/sauna area, and the perfume in the rooms was a little strong (especially the closet area—so if you have allergies to that it may be sensitive). But, once again, the staff were phenomenal, room service was great, cleanliness and facility upkeep was great, and you can’t beat the location. Definitely would recommend (with the caveat that we didn't pay full price--it's a very nice hotel, but doesn't contain the ""wow"" factor that the price indicates).","North Bethesda, Maryland","Eman R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Bethesda, Maryland</strong>",41,4.0

So expectations are high accordingly. Like a previous review, I am a Platinum (Elite) and very little was done for me. I was ""upgraded"" to a room which has no closet, so I needed to ""downgrade"" back in my original low category facing another building (yuck... don't book a low category room in this hotel - nasty). The room itself is nice, marble bathrooms, nice furnishings but nothing surprising - it's similar and perhaps at a lower luxury level than other Ritz Carltons, especially comparing the non-US properties.Then there is the shower. The water pressure was literally a trickle. This is extremely basic and I was rather upset about this. Is the whole hotel like this or only my very subpar room. I was in room 415 - so be warned if you are assigned this room. But given that this is a solo business trip, having a nice relaxing shower is sort of a ""must have"". Given that I was so tired, I just dealt with it rather than asking to change rooms (or even change hotel, which came across my mind). All I can say is that shower was so unacceptable that it was possibly the worst shower I took in the past 5 years in my 300+ nights of hotels. Totally unaccepable for a Ritz Carlton.I will absolutely not return.

So we checked the shower only to find all the hardware on the shower floor (faucets, knobs, screws etc.). Further, I am a lifetime Platinum member and was entitled to an upgraded room. When they figured that they had to move me because of an inoperable bathroom, the suddenly had these upgraded rooms to move me.

We weren't quite sure exactly how friendly was, ""Pet Friendly"", when we decided to travel with our 10lb. Pomeranian. As it turned out, very friendly indeed. The location, across from Central Park, was perfect - no in room accidents, a readily available bathroom across the street, and lots of sights and sounds to keep a little dog fascinated.

He went above and beyond to help us and he was extremely friendly. He was able to get us a reservation at a popular Italian restaurant and he found a very special and rare kind of whiskey we were looking for to celebrate a 60th birthday in our party. The doormen Felix and Al were superb as well - both extremely welcoming and gracious. We will stay here again for those three men alone. The lobby is beautiful and a great place for a night cap.

The bell men are so helpful and very sharp. All the staff can address us by name which really makes it feel like home. We have had a couple of occasions with delayed flights and needed last minute accommodations as we did not want to wait out at the airport. The Front desk team are were always there to help us check back in and find us a excellent place for last minute dinner. We used to stay more up town but one stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park and I couldn’t picture myself anywhere else in NYC. This last stay we received a newly renovated room. More techs stuff added to the rooms and it’s much brighter and cleaner looking.

Our family's choice does not wane - we do from time-to-time search out those ""boutique"" experiences looking for that new thrill - only to know where we have to return for the refined, exceptional service that only the Ritz can offer. This weekend was no exception, a welcome reminder of the refinement that flows, freely, from this gentle giant. Our weekend was set to drop our daughter at Fordham, Lincoln Center, to begin her college career. A move that would be as emotionally charged as it would be beautiful. Coinciding with my 50ish birthday, the Ritz was on task. No moment of our weekend was overlooked. The welcome gifts, the ""diet aware"" treats, the service, all unparalleled in our experiences elsewhere. We visit the RC Central Park around once or twice a year and are always pleased. This trip however re-set the bar. The newly renovated rooms are exceptional, and a delight regardless of your budget (deluxe or super deluxe).

My wife and I recently stayed at the Ritz for our Anniversary trip. The concierge staff is the best we’ve experienced in any hotel we’ve ever stayed. They helped with dinner reservations, getting us into the hardest to get places in NYC. I casually mentioned it was our anniversary and received an email from Guest Services asking if I could send a couple pictures of my wife and me. When we arrived to our room, they had left us a bottle of champagne and framed pictures of the two of us from over the years. Everywhere we went in the hotel, we were acknowledged by name and wished a Happy Anniversary. Even at our Afternoon Tea, they brought us macaroons with Happy Anniversary written on the plate. One staffer asked if we needed help getting tickets to a show. I mentioned we had tickets to The Band’s Visit on Broadway. When we returned from the show to retrieve our luggage before heading to the airport, they gave us a small gift bag with a note and copy of the Musical’s soundtrack. This hotel has small touches down to a science. This is in addition to the beautifully renovated rooms that have to be some of the most spacious in NYC. The Ritz should be commended for all they do to make their guests feel so comfortable and welcomed. I cannot imagine a better place to stay than this hotel. Thanks to the entire Ritz Central Park team for making our anniversary trip so special.

We stayed at this Ritz Carlton last September (2017) and it was obvious the rooms were in desperate need of being refurbished. Hotel management offered us a free three night stay in one of the newly refurbished rooms if we returned. We decided to take them up on their offer as we needed to be in NYC anyway. Our room was a newly re-done Deluxe Park View Suite on the 16th floor. In fact, we were only the 10th guests to stay in this room. The room was beautiful and HUGE. We had a wonderful view of Central Park. The room was clean and very well appointed. The public spaces have been updated and re-painted as well. It is obvious that the hotel has made a real effort to bring this magnificent property back to the high standards one would expect for a Ritz Carlton property. The staff were excellent. Very attentive and they anticipated our needs. When our travels bring us back to New York city, we will stay at this property again.

Hotel’s location is convenient, and room is big and clean.Unfortunately, we faced number of issues.1- I called up guest service and asked for a scale. The agent was speaking to me over the phone but I could barely hear her. I said “sorry I cannot hear you” and pushed the volume up button several times. She scolded at me saying “P.L.E.A.S.E DO NOT DO THAT ON THE PHONE WITH ME. IT BEEPS REALLY LOUDLY BUT I WILL SEND UP THE SCALE AT THIS TIME”. I apologized to her that I couldn’t hear her but what does she mean by “at this time”?2- A gentleman brought the scale up to the room and asked me if I needed anything else. I asked for a black coffee as there was no coffee station in the room. My coffee order was never delivered this day.3- 5 star hotel without a coffee station. I had to spend 26 dollars (with tips) for a pot of coffee the next day morning. It was delivered quick which was good.4- fridge in the room was not working. 5- “privacy” means nothing. Even if we had put DND sign on the door knob, housekeeping came 3 times knocking on the door and even opened the door with the master key! This happened 3 days out of 3 nights stay. 6- bad odor comes up from the carpet in the room, had to have strong AC on at all times. 7- you can hear the sound of metro passing by every single time, all day and all night. Our room was on the 10th floor and we were able to hear and feel it’s pass.8- there was “bellman gratuities of USD 22.25” charged to the room. I’ve never seen a hotel charging bellman service to bring the luggages up to the room after tipping the bellman directly. 9- internet was super slow.10- there was a package arrived to the hotel before our check out and no one notified us. We went back to the hotel and had to wait 20-30 minutes to collect a package from the Conciege as it seems they didn’t know where it was placed. Overall, it wasn’t a 5 star experience.

Parts of the stay were amazing and magical and some facets were just bad.. Let me start by saying my wife will only stay at Ritz properties if they are available, Ritz properties usually give her nothing to complain about, but unfortunately she complained quite a bit about this one. Biggest gripe was no espresso or coffee machine in the room and the small room size. I don't think we've ever stayed in a room that small or a room without a coffee machine, which upon waking up the first morning we discovered no nespresso or coffee machine which made for a very grumpy morning as we got the family ready for the first day of vacation. We need to wake up with coffee to function well.. so on the second morning we scheduled coffee to be delivered to the room at 8am with the front desk after we were told we couldn't get a coffee machine in the room. I set the alarm and woke up early and got dressed to receive coffee from room service at 8am.. And Nobody showed up from Room Service. So i waited and went out to get Starbucks at 8:45am with the family all still asleep.. by the time I got back my wife woke up and called and let them know the coffee was not delivered.. they did bring her the $27 coffee at 9:45 am just in time for us to leave the room for the day.. I think she took 2 sips of that delicious $27 coffee pot.. It did not get drunk at all.. She did rave about how great the coffee was later on at breakfast though.. The 3rd day I just went directly to starbucks and couldn't rely on the hotel at all for life's most essential requirement. The other bothersome issue we had was with getting a rollaway bed delivered to our room for our son.. We had to ask for it 3 times the first day.. We asked for a rollaway upon check-in.. Then as we were leaving for dinner the turn down service lady was coming in and we discussed the rollaway with her and she said she was there to take care of it and set it up and I tipped her and we went off to dinner.. When we got back to the room around 11pm with a sleeping child on my shoulder there was still no rollaway bed in the room.. We had to call and ask for a 3rd time.. just annoying and pathetic.. especially when you are paying an additional $75.00 a night for a rollaway bed and then tipping the turn down service lady $20 to set it up and she lies right to your face and does not set it up.. not a wonderful feelingOther than the very small room size and no coffee machine the room was perfect.. it was impeccable and so clean.. The rooms were just newly renovated and everything was so fresh and brand new.. not a blemish in the room.. The room was super tiny though, I guess thats probably customary and a given in New York, I'm not holding that against them.. just don't expect a very spacious room here. The Bathroom was plenty big enough though.. The bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom, but we got an interior room and I certainly would not make that mistake again. We could barely move in the room.The Concierge was always amazing in our interactions and sent us to many amazing restaurants.. I definitely recommend having the hotel set you up for a picnic in Central Park.. they provide an amazing experience with Blankets, awesome food and picnic baskets and was so much fun for the kids.. the picnic they provide is top notch in every aspectBest Part of the hotel is definitely the concierges and lobby lounge.. Lobby staff and food were so nice and a wonderful part of our trip..

Absolutely one of the best shows in television history! And I inform Ender - who is in charge of guest relations - as to the reason for our visit a few days before we come out.Wait for it...wait for it.We walk into our hotel room - and there it stands: A frame - made out of chocolate - surrounding an edible picture of the TV show.Yes. You read that correctly (see pic).WHO DOES THAT???!!!And what’s more - Loic (the hotel manager) took it upon himself to source imported candies from France. Why is this a big deal? Because during a previous visit he learned of our upcoming trip to the South of France and prepared a four-page document on places to visit (he did this from scratch as he is from France). And later - when he found out we had to cancel the trip - he proceeded to get these French treats for us as a condolence.

We had a seamless adventure in NYC for our anniversary weekend and the Ritz-Carlton made our stay one to remember.A huge thank you to the staff for answering my endless questions and always greeting us with an umbrella and a smile last Saturday!

I booked a standard Club Guest Room, and that's exactly what I was given, no consideration given toward my Ritz Carlton Platinum Elite status More on this in a bit.Service wise, the hotel is up to typical Ritz standards with professional and polite service Room was a fair size and resembles the ""old school"" Ritz style, i.e., very elegant Even though the hotel is an older building, the bathroom was pretty updated, offering a separate tub and shower and separate water closet and very nicely laid out. One note, though, the room did lack sufficient power outlets and no usb ports. I'm sure this will be resolved in the upcoming renovation. View wise, as advertised, it was an interior view which is mostly of the adjacent buildings' brick walsl. Unless you specifically reserve a view room, you'll most likely have a similar view. Club lounge was a bit disappointing, as some other reviewers have mentioned, and compared to other Ritz Carlton Club lounges, you can definitely notice some lacking items.  Wine selection was limited and unlike other Ritz's, where if the club doesn't have a certain wine or other cocktail, most other Ritz lounge staff would offer to get from the lobby bar, not happening here. The offerings here are on the limited side, which is especially disappointing being that this is to be considered the Flagship Ritz Carlton, and one of the more higher priced club lounges. Another missing aspect was not one single hot item was offered during the evening presentations. When I inquired, I was told they do not offer hot items due to the smell of food. That makes no sense to me. I've been to many many Ritz Club lounges throughout the USA and overseas and everyone I've been to has offered 2 or more hot items. Now on to the Elite benefits. As with a lot of Ritz Carltons, they just don't like to honor the Elite Benefits. As a platinum, one of the benefits is an upgrade, even to a suite, per the terms and conditions. Right before I checked in, I went on to the app to see what other room types were available. They were still selling better view rooms as well as a variety of different suites. At check in, I inquired about a suite upgrade and was told, all suites were sold out. While I know this wasn't true, I then proceed to ask if at the least, I could receive a nicer view room but received the same answer. I wasn't in the mood to argue or create an even further awkward situation, but I really dislike when the front desk agents are not honest, and use the sold out excuse. I checked again later that evening, and still, higher category rooms were available. I get the hotel does not like to give away upgrades for free, but this is a benefit of being platinum, and if it is available, it should be honored, even more so if it's requested. I've experienced the same situation at the San Francisco property. If they don't want to honor the benefits, I'd respect it more for the hotel to just not participate in the rewards program, than in comparison to being dishonest. I'd stay here again, and recommend to others, with just the caveat to elite members, of not expecting many of the promised benefits. Hopefully, after the renovation, the club will step up it's game, and by then, the newly merged rewards program will be in effect, and hopefully better honor the program benefits.","Chicago, Illinois","WorldTr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",11,4.0

Cassidy Davis was outstanding and guided us through everything , even making dinner reservations at a great Italian restaurant at the last moment. She answered every question I had and made the trip smooth. Once we arrived at hotel it was luxury at its finest. Champagne upon arrival. An escort to the room and just flat out great service all around. Even upgraded us to access to the club lounge for the weekend ( which if you stay here is a must) . We just reserved a basic Basic deluxe king room and it was outstanding. Clean , roomy and luxurious. The hotel knew we were seeing Billy Joel Friday and even left a Billy Joel CD in our room when we got back. I also must give a special shout out to Damien at the door and valet he was awesome. He was helpful extremely nice and went out of his way for us. He made sure we had house car to go to the concert and to restaurant before our broadway show on Saturday and he personally left a frozen CD in our room to remember our show.

The hotel has limited amenities if you don’t get access to the club lounge and despite paying $925 for a king room, we didn’t get in. Also had to pay for WiFi access which is really poor in this day and age - it’s free in a coffee shop for the price of a coffee, so I expect it to be included in a premium room charge. The bar was nice and the lounge a nice place to while away some time. The Auden restaurant was ok, although the food was quite ordinary (I had the lamb loin which was tasty but really tough). The worst part was the flagpole mounted right outside our window which clattered and clanged all night in the wind, so avoid room 312. Overall we had a pleasant experience and nothing went wrong. I just felt my experience was only worth about $500-600 a night rather than the price I paid, so I would prefer to stay elsewhere next time I am in town.

Wine list was great, but service was awful. Had to flag down server for a drink, and soon after that another server approached us saying that there was ""an accounting issue"", that if we were ""paying with cash we should pay right away...but that we could wait if we planned on using credit or debit cards"". A bizarre occurrence at such a well renowned establishment. This gentleman soon brought us a check, and came by repeatedly to check for cash. We told him we would be paying with a card and he backed away for awhile. A few minutes later, our server came and asked if our card was in the black bifold. I couldn't believe it! There were several other tables in the room, and even in the tackiest of Applebee's, I have never been asked that question. Appalling. He came back again five minutes later to ask if we were ready. Our glasses were halfway full, we were still munching on the plates we ordered, so no. The time was 11:30pm and several tables remained. Another server paced in front of our table and picked up the bill. It was ridiculous. We paid before the bar closed and before other tables in the restaurant, yet we felt completely rushed.

I then asked her about the club level and she quickly told me that our reservations doesn’t come with access. I politely told her that was what we booked and we had even received an email from them welcoming us. She said again that it didn’t show on our reservation and that we didn’t have access but we should go ahead and go to our room and she would check and IF (yes she even stressed the word IF) our reservation had access she would bring new keys. Well of course she had to bring us new keys because our room did have club access as we tried to politely tell her.

Clearly, the person who took my car radioed in who I was, but it was a nice touch that really helped to make me feel welcomed. From there, staff helped at each step from getting through the check-in up to my room. For a few reasons, though, I give my overall stay four rather than five stars. First, this is a very expensive hotel and I'm just not sure my standard sized room was worth all of that money. Second, my room window looked to the back of the hotel and the view consisted only of the brownish brick walls of other buildings. Finally, when I got my car back upon leaving, the attendant had changed my radio settings.

We’ve decided to stay here for my wife’s 50th bday celebration. The “deluxe” Central Park view room was nice, clean and there was lots of drawer/closet space; however, it was on the smallish size, no coffee machine, the TV flickers and some lamps that were outdated (eg. hard to even turn on). We did have a nice view of Central Park but too bad the windows were a bit on the dirty side and one of the blinds was broken - it didn’t open/close properly; we did not complain as we were only staying for one night. The shower stream was on the weaker side - who wants a shower saver head when we are staying in a hotel? There was only one (1) USB plug in the entire room (via a very outdated alarm clock which no one will use) and there’s NO outlets on the two nightstands - the hotel really needs to get with the times and update the electrical outlets to accommodate basic electronic devices. Thank goodness I always bring my own USB outlets with extra long USB cables to charge my devices. We were told by the stocking bar person (who came into the room soon after we checked in) that the Ritz Carlton small water bottles are free even though it’s listed for $2.50 - hope we don’t get charged for that. We had free wifi as I’m a Ritz Carlton member - unfortunately, you cannot download anything via Netflix as it’s extremely slow. Ritz Carlton emailed me a few days prior to my arrival on what they can do for my stay ... I emailed back that it would be nice to have something in the room to acknowledge my wife’s bday (chocolate or fruits - which I gladly would’ve paid for) but there was no acknowledgment in the room whatsoever (not great customer service for this type of hotel). Also, they don’t seem to have 24 hour doorman as we’ve had to open/close the main entrance door several times ourselves - we don’t mind doing that but that was unexpected for this hotel. We’ve been to smaller, boutique NYC hotels and they have 24 hr doorman (eg. all 24 hours). On the plus side, the location is right across from Central Park, the staff was extremely friendly, helpful and even said “Happy Birthday” to my wife - so I know they got the email :)","New York City, New York","PYLI19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",43,4.0

We did ask for a room change after our first night, but reception they said they were fully booked. Disappointing, but understandable.Problems with this particular room:* There's what sounds like an air compressor starting up every 25 minutes, lasting for 1 minute (this was not the aircon unit in the room). If you're a light sleeper or suffering from jetlag, it makes getting to sleep unbearable. The bed was fantastic though!* In and approaching the room, some of the decor is coming away from the walls.* The carpet had visible staining, especially around the TV area.* The shower head plate wasn't connected to the marble correctly.* The bath filler tap leaked, causing water to run onto the bathroom floor.* Plus other general ""tattyness"", such as large scuff/gouge marks over the wardrobe doors and other furniture, paint spilled onto the marble etc..Overall we had a great stay mostly because the location, but weren't in the room for too long - other than sleeping.

Whilst checking in I didn’t feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on. Overall staying at Ritz Hotels is amazing experience but this particular stay did not make me feel like a valued customer....","Southport, United Kingdom","DiJones36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southport, United Kingdom</strong>",19,3.0

On the 3rd night we prepared to celebrate my mothers 50th and as always dressed and ready to go the last thing was to put our jewellery on. To much shock my mothers Rolex watch wasn't in the bedside table where it had been earlier in the day, turning the room upside down for several hours without any luck (and missing reservations for the bookings we had) we had no option to call security. Whilst we discussed the watch we suggested that before my mother had placed the watch into her bedside table she had laid out all of the items in her bedside table onto the bed to organise them (she had done this as with jet lag she woke up at 4am and without disturbing us just tidied her draw) therefore we come to the conclusion there was a possibility the watch was in the laundry as the cleaner would have just folded up the bedding and thrown it into the shoot, so the plan was to wait for the shoot to be checked the next day. This night was now gone so we took a short walk and went back to the hotel with too much drama we didn't feel like staying out. I might add that the safe in the hotel is so slim and the size of an A4 sheet of paper (but about 5cm thick) unless you have tall items its not hard to fill, we had been Black Friday shopping and completely filled it. The following day I was offered club room access, which I should have got anyway due to the fact I am a platinum member and stay no where in the world without club lounge access plus it was on the booking, so this was resolved. This is a conversation I had when I checked in but was unable to resolve. The following evening it was confirmed the watch was not found in the laundry- we were then asked to complete a report with the police, bearing in mind this was our last evening of a short 4 day trip! We agreed and waited for the police to arrive - again missing all the reservations we had made. The police arrived and we were asked to go to the police station. We were taken in the police car to the station this night was now completely ruined!! in fact the whole trip now was the biggest waste of money ever!!!The security guy I dealt with at the hotel had given me his number and email and was very nice to deal with but knowing we were departing the next day didn't respond to emails or we didn't see him again nor has he responded to date, I was advised Marriott claims would call me when I got home.Sure enough the hotels claim department called me to tell me they don't hold insurance liability for the watch, I explained I didn't want them to replace or pay for the watch, the watch was gone however I wanted to know what the outcome was. I said I could not believe how I was treated at the hotel and how my family and i were made to feel the criminals and left so upset and disappointed!! - I advised I was a valuable customer, to which I was told we do not offer good will gestures!! I again advised I wasnt after compensation or money I wanted to know what actions had been taken and how serious the situation was to me and my family... nothing.... not only was my £5,000+ holiday ruined, special memories lost, a watch stolen, what felt like being arrested and interviewed - but as a such loyal customer not even an email apology not even a response to my emails to the security manager. I am genuinely gobsmacked this is how a company wants to treat its customers, let alone how they are actually treated... I would not recommend this hotel other than its location based on my experience.",,651SJ,39,1.0

But to our dismay, this experience which was supposed to be one of the highlights of our NYC trip was truly disappointing. Thankfully, we manage to find humor on whatever went with it and still enjoyed the company of good friends.First, there was a big hype on the ""STAR LOUNGE"" as the venue for the afternoon tea, but this place doesn't even have any view of the central park at all, nor does it exclusively cater for afternoon tea ceremony on pre designated time. The lounge is basically a small confined area of the hotel here guests can either have cocktails, or simply chill out in the area, read news paper or do office work. Literally, half of the customers were there with their laptop and not there for the afternoon tea ceremony.Considering it is The Ritz , you would expect to be welcomed warmly but to our dismay, no one was paying attention to our arrival or even leading us to our table. The waitress is not very keen to her attention to details and seem to be serving us haphazardly. Literally, when she served the tea, the hot water spilled in our table. We had to look for server to ask for honey, and replace our tea because it literally taste nothing, like water.. The sandwiches are too small, very cold, and taste like they have been prepared 2 days ago. Scones were dense, moist and we enjoyed the cream that went with it. The cookies are extremely tiny looked like a store bought cookie.Please do not call this HIGH TEA because high tea comes with hot meal and the small amount of serving they provide is definitely not worth the price you pay for.Also, Ritz should train their staffs to smile, and serve with finesse and sense of elegance. After all, it is Ritz Carlton so we pay for the premium of better service than this.

Only have kind words for the Concierge and the Bell Staff. Had a family vacation with two rooms and was surprised at the continuous and persistent mishaps and mediocre service in many areas, specially the Club Lounge. In short, we had issues with service - staff at restaurant, Club Lounge and Bar seemed more interested in taking to each other than in their clients. Food served burned, breakfast dishes served cold, inattentive servers, etc. etc. Room service was very good, fast and food served hot and as ordered. Housekeeping in their own time, one night they would not do turndown, other nights yes, last night one room yes and other room no. Last night issue with the AC, didn't work well below 70, next day repaired men in the hallway. Elevators very slow, seemed at least one out of service, room keys didn't work in another elevator. Club Lounge was the biggest disappointment, for $150-$200 a night/ person it is really not worth it. Staff at the Lounge were always cold and impersonal, no greetings, no interest in service or offering drinks ( like other lounges ), minimal offer of wines and drinks, limited offer of breakfast, hors de oeuvre and others. The only thing good at the Lounge were the cookies and lots of candy, that is expensive candy. We were really disappointed at our current stay, would have though that this Ritz had a name to maintain, but it really felt like a downgraded hotel and that is a very expensive downgraded hotel in service, attention and food offer.","Panama City, Panama","Ancon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Panama City, Panama</strong>",96,3.0

Our room was dark and old. throughout the stay, there were several of the housekeeper carts in the hallway by my room 24 hours a day. On 9/14, we returned to the room and found that my Mom's special orthopedic pillow was gone. Pilar from housekeeping came to our room and told us that they couldn't find the pillow, and would keep looking. She also said that this wasn't up to Ritz standards. That was the last we heard about the pillow from anyone at the Ritz. We didn't get a follow up call the next day or ever despite frequent attempts. On 9/15, the rude front desk clerk informed that I had to check out at noon despite gold status and assurances of a 4 pm check out when I check in to the hotel. The New York Ritz is old and needs upkeep, but the reason I would definitely never stay at this hotel again is the poor customer service from a supposedly five star hotel especially with the $1000 per night room cost. surprised at the poor customer service at one of my favorite hotel brands.

We really appreciated these kind thought. It is surprising in a hotel of this size that the staff remember your name, I didn';t expect this!The room overlooking Central park was huge with everything you could possible need close to hand.

Housekeeping manager was called in, she took some pictures and offered us deep room cleaning and comped bottle of wine. We agreed and when we started to get ready to get out of the room and venture into the city, strong smell of cigarette smoke started coming out of our bathroom. We were finally fed up and demanded to move to another room. From this moment on the hotel staff mostly delivered the expected level of service. They put a nice camping tent in our room for a 3 year old, changed linens in the tent daily and she was enjoying it for the whole stay. There was no funky smell of cleaning supplies in the room.If you want better park view please book deluxe park view rooms. Floors 8-9 are on the level with treetops from the park.

The treatment we received was far beyond anything I've ever experienced (or expected) and I'm sure some of it had to do with the fact that the room was booked by a friend. With that said, the Ritz-Carlton Central Park is a 5-star establishment in every sense of the rating, and I'm sure a place like this would make your stay very special regardless of whether you do or do not know the staff.--------------------------------------------------------------I was proposing to my girlfriend, and I had a full evening of events planned which included the following: the actual proposal at the Lincoln Center fountain, dinner at Marea, Tchaikovsky at the Metropolitan Opera, and a 1-night stay at the Ritz-Carlton Central Park.I arrived at the hotel around 3PM, and I was an absolute train-wreck. I had just gotten out of work, and I was going out of my mind trying to make sure that all the evening’s details were in order, and at the same time texting my girlfriend a cover story so that she would not find out what was going on. I was in desperate need of a both a shower and a shave. I was also loaded down with about 20lbs of overnight bags. I'm quite sure I looked like a vagabond.The moment I got within 10 feet of the Ritz’s door, a tall gentleman smiled at me and asked if I was checking-in to the hotel. I replied that ""Yes indeed I am sir"" and he immediately relieved me of my 20lbs of luggage and whisked me away to the front desk.I was then greeted by a cheerful young lady who smiled and said ""Welcome to the Ritz-Carlton, sir! Are you here for any occasion in particular?"" I said that I was proposing to my girlfriend, and upon that revelation another gentleman immediately stepped in and offered to keep the ring in their safe. I patted the right-side of my pants and replied that ""The safe will be right here in my pocket!"" and the entire front desk staff began cracking up (another thing about this place is the staff has an excellent sense of humor). When it came time to assign me a room, I asked if there was any way to get a room with a view of Central Park. She grimaced as she looked down at her computer screen and said that unfortunately none of the park-view rooms were currently available, but if I were to come back in a few hours she would surely have one ready. I told her that unfortunately I needed to clean myself up, and so I would just take what she has available at the moment. She then smiled and offered something that truly astounded me: ""Why don't we check you into a room right now so you can wash up, then we will transfer your things to a park-view room and have it ready upon your return?"" My jaw dropped. I have never heard of such an accommodating, hospitable offer in all my life. I replied that ""sure, that would be just wonderful,"" and slipped her a few $20s as a thank you for her efforts.I was in a bit of a stupor at this point, and didn't fully remember where I was, and so one of their lovely, front-desk gentlemen personally escorted me up the elevator and into my room. Before he left, he asked if there was anything special that I would like to be done, and so I slipped him a $20 and told him to just surprise me. He smiled and said that he would ""surprise me with his surprise"" and left me to get ready.I looked around at this initial room and examined what I was dealing with. The furnishings were superb. Solid wood details, and all of my stuff had been neatly put away (and hung) in the appropriate closets. I then examined the bathroom. Boy, does the Ritz know how to do a bathroom! The entire thing was built of solid marble and was nearly the same size as the room itself. Needless to say, everything was spotless, and the room was immaculate. Ahh! I was finally beginning to relax! Since I was seeing Tchaikovsky that evening, I opened up my iPhone, put on The Nutcracker Suite, puffed a few spritzes of Green Irish Tweed into the air, popped a new blade into my double-edge razor, and began my shower/shave engagement-preparation ritual.When I was done, I dried myself off, slicked back my hair, put on a freshly-pressed suit, and carefully examined the results in the mirror. Boy, does a shower/shave at the Ritz make you feel like a million bucks! I left the room and walked into the hotel lobby a new man! I said my goodbyes to the lobby staff as they wished me good-luck, and just as I was about to leave the hotel, wouldn't you know it, that same wonderful lady from the front desk ran over, handed me a new room key, and said that she had managed to secure ""one of the finest rooms this hotel has to offer."" I said ""thank you"" and then decided I would visit this new room before I left.As I entered into the elevator I noticed that the room key was for the 22nd floor. As I pressed the button for ""22"" I noticed that ""22"" was the highest floor the elevator would go to. ""Interesting,"" I thought to myself as the elevator arrived at its destination. I stepped out, and proceeded to the room’s door. I swiped my key, I heard the mechanics of the lock “click” and unwind, and as I opened up the door to this new room my heart lept out of my chest as I saw two magnificent, 10-foot windows overlooking classic Central Park. Boy, what a sight! A penthouse-suite overlooking the 39 million square feet of foliage that composes New York City’s grandiose Central Park! Now, I have lived off of Central Park West for nearly 13 years, and I have been in many multimillion dollar apartments… never in my life have I seen a view like this. Extraordinary! The Ritz had truly outdone itself!Regarding the proposal: I won’t bore you with all the details of my time spent away from the Ritz except to say that she said “yes,” and that the two of us are currently betrothed to spend the rest of our lives together.So after a wonderful evening of love, dinner, dance, and music, I suggested to my fiancee that we take a stroll down Central Park South. A little sidebar - if you are a couple and have never walked down Central Park South at night (in all its lamp-lit glory) - I would highly recommend it. It is one of the most romantic things you can do and will make you feel like you’ve been transported back to Gatsby-era New York. So like I said, we were walking down Central Park South. When we came upon the entrance to the Ritz, I suddenly stopped (I had managed to keep it a secret up to this point) and our conversation went something like this:“Oh, interesting, here’s the Ritz” - she gave me a funny look.“Oh, interesting, here’s a room key” - complete shock and awe as I revealed the rectangular, plastic card.“Oh, interesting, the penthouse floor” - nearly in tears as we travelled up the elevator.She was full-on speechless when I opened the door, but her vocal chords soon revved back to life with proclamations of joy as she walked around the room and examined its opulent accoutrements. Once again, the Ritz had truly outdone itself! They had decked the room out like a scene from Snow White! There was:-A rose petal pathway leading up to the bed, where there was a rose petal heart in the center-A room service cart with chocolate covered strawberries and an ice bucket with Taittinger champagne, compliments of the house-A bouquet of flowers neatly arranged on the ottoman by the bed-And to top it all off, they dimmed the lights and had “Swan Lake” playing (a fitting end to the evening since we had seen a collected works of Tchaikovsky at Lincoln Center)The hospitality of the Ritz extended well into the next day. They have a little thingy you can fill out and hang outside your door telling them what you want for breakfast the next day, and they will bring it right up to your room at the exact time you specify. So a large pot of coffee was brought up to our room at 9am sharp. Let me tell you, there is nothing quite like sipping coffee in morning with the woman you love, while looking out the window to a perfect view to God’s wondrous creation in New York City’s magnificent Central Park. Spectacular.We checked out around 12 noon, and asked if they would hold our bags while we walked around the Park. They held our bags for nearly 2 hrs (again - what lovely hospitality). When we came back to pick them up, we ran into the nice gentleman who decked out our room, and he asked us if we had taken the Swan Lake CD? I told him we didn’t because we thought it was property of the hotel, so he told us to wait one moment, and he ran up to the room and brought it down. He said we could have it as a keepsake. I slipped him another tip for his fine service and then said our final thank-you’s and goodbye’s to the lobby staff. So that was it for the Ritz!Needless to say, the entire ordeal was a massive success, thanks in no small part to the staff at the Ritz-Carlton. Bravo, Ritz-Carlton Central Park! Bravo! I would quite literally applaud you from my computer chair if I thought that you could hear it. What an introduction to the Ritz brand! My fiancee and I are now in love with the Ritz, and want to stay with them every chance we can get. We will probably stay at the Ritz for our honeymoon - we are thinking Kapalua or maybe perhaps the St. Thomas location. We also recently stayed at the South Beach location for a day, and it was also a great time. Well worth it. But I do have to say, staying at the South Beach location (which was an excellent time) did make me appreciate how truly special the staff at Central Park location is. Honestly, I don’t think there is another hotel staff anywhere in the world quite like them.Well beyond five stars.

Overall, I must say the service was 5 star...Ritz-Carlton Personnel are well trained to deal with their customers in the most helpful and accommodating fashion. I especially want to single out the concierge, George, who is on another level of helpfulness. But every interaction...from the front door bellmen who will offer you an umbrella the minute the weather turns rainy, to smiling front desk personnel (Denise from Germany....the sweetest!!) ...you are made to feel like a treasured guest! Now, for the not-so-good stuff:the hotel facilities themselves....outdated, worn, even...it has to be said...downright shabby!.My first room (which I adamantly rejected) was like a dark, bleak prison cell with shabby, stained, worn rugs and no sunlight at all. My second room (personnel does really try to make you happy) was better...I had more windows and some distant park views along with some views of 60th street below...not horrendous. But, a rather small, musky smelling room with...again...stained and worn rugs and a hallway that isn't air-conditioned right outside your room....there is a fan standing in every hallway that's both blowing hot air around and an eyesore to boot! The elevator is likewise hot like a sauna. On some days there would be a table outside across from my room in the hallway with many dirty glasses and dishes on top of it to greet me as I left my room and stepped into the hallway...and even still be there when I'd return hours later....My sink in my bathroom wouldn't drain (it got fixed after I complained...but ran slow again 2 days later...)...my toilet got clogged (also got fixed...but, why was it clogged in the first place...?)...the TV never had good reception....i was watching everything as if living in a war torn country...lots of static and noise in the background. People, this is the Ritz-Carlton, for crying out loud!!! I've stayed at Ritz-Carlton's in Hawaii, in Puerto Rico, in Miami, in St. Thomas, and many many more...never would I have expected this level of neglect and disrepair! The best personnel in the world can't save an experience that falls this far from 5-star that it really should be 3 star or even less!! (Wouldn't really know, I've never stayed in anything less than 3.5 star and even that's been a while...)...but because the people who work there are so so nice I gave the hotel 4 stars. I truly hope they are paying their employees well bc, boy, do they deserve it! As for me, the only way Ritz-Carlton can have me back as a customer (and I do travel to NY all the time)...is if they totally upgrade their hotel and then send me an invite to experience their new and improved accommodations as their guest....then, if I like what I experience, I would consider booking there again.

We had booked 3 nights here on July 4th, 5th, and 6th 2017 with the intention of extending longer. We were celebrating my daughters special 10th birthday. I am a RC Platinum rewards member and my wife booked this stay with Melody directly at the hotel and we were paying for this stay and not using any points. Upon booking my wife stressed the need for a double room with a roll away bed and was told this wouldn't be a problem. Upon check in we did get a double room #617 but were told that roll away beds were not permitted. After we got to our room we called the front desk a couple times (spoke to Denise) explaining the difficult situation that we were in and that we were assured a roll away bed at time of booking but again were told roll away beds are not permitted and they were sorry for the miscommunication. We were absolutely stunned. Not only did anyone we talked to seemed very concerned they sure were not very understanding and seemed like they could really care less! They did offer us an upgrade to a suite for another +$250 per night but at this point we were so upset we knew we were going to leave the next day and just decided to stay the one night and checked out the next morning. Looking back on the situation we should have just left and not even stayed the one night.We have stayed at many RC Hotels all over the world and were never treated so poorly at any RC Hotel ever. The service and attention to detail is a lot to be desired here. I sent an email to shortly after check in to David Cassidy in guest relations and I predicted a same day response but didn't get it. Finally the next day I got a response and after all that happened to us they offered us a free $40 carriage ride in a predicted response that stated how they pride themselves on service and detail and corrected the problem in the reservation center so it doesn't happen again.While I do appreciate the offer it was actually very quite insulting and a free carriage ride doesn't fix our problem. Really, is this the best they could do for the prices they charge during a time when the hotel was not very busy? They sure didn't have any problem trying to upgrade me to a suite for another +$250 per night! I don't feel they gave this very much thought? This is totally unacceptable and inexcusable. Not for one moment do I feel anyone of the staff at this hotel was considerate enough to put themselves in our situation and how we felt and they should be ashamed of themselves. I plan to immediately cancel my Ritz Carlton credit card and pull right out the rewards program. And once again I will predict that the hotel will respond to this review with the standard form email response apologizing for the miscommunication and how they pride themselves on excellent service and look forward to making it up to me on our next visit.

Stayed for 2 nights with a family of 3 including an 8 year old on his first visit to the city. Here are all the pluses to the property:Location is fantastic. Right on the edge of the park away from all of the noise but a close walk to everything. 5th Avenue is right there and Columbus Circle is just a short walk down Central Park. Staff is also excellent and serve as perfect ambassadors The the Ritz brand. All were extremely kind and attentive including Ronald with pre-registration, Denise at check in, and Ender. A special note about Ender: he asked my son if he wanted to go ""camping"" during his stay. He came up to the room and set up a tent! It was awesome. I also want to make note of the doormen and everyone at the front who are equally friendly and helpful. Room was great and relatively spacious for a standard room in the city. I've read the reviews about the need for a renovation but we found the room to be in great shape. It is traditionally appointed but the decor is in line with the building. Bathroom was also a good size. Opt for a park view. We had a nice partial view on the 14th floor which was perfect. My only true minus from our visit was the turndown service. Sunday night they came at almost 9:00 PM and the next night at 10:00 PM! Way too late especially for a weeknight. I've never had turndown service that late. Certainly not a deal breaker but a bit surprising. I would make sure to ask for early turndown service. Overall a great stay. The hotel staff truly makes the difference!

And of course, in the USA, my home country. I share this so the reader has context for the statements I am making in this review - statements that might, at first glance, seem over the top. Believe me when I tell you, I embellish nothing.As one would expect of a Ritz-Carlton, the staff are excellent. The food is phenomenal. The club level is unparalleled. And the property is exquisite. But that's not what makes a Ritz-Carlton a Ritz-Carlton. That's just par for their course. What make a Ritz a Ritz is that extra special ""something."" That small (or big) gesture that catches one by surprise, and that reveals the true character - and captures the essence - of the culture of a company dedicated to its craft. And that essence is embodied perfectly by Ender, the gentlemen who greeted us upon our arrival.We took our daughter to NY to celebrate her graduation (and her scholarship as she pursues a career in theater). What better place to do so than Broadway? Because she's never been to NY, I put us up in the heart of Times Square at the New York Marriott Marquis. But I also knew of the quality of The Ritz-Carlton, and opted to book one night at the hotel (our last night). How I wish we would have stayed there the entire time. On the day of our arrival, we enter the lobby and Ender greets us and escorts us to check-in. I happen to be wearing a Ritz-Carlton ball cap from San Francisco - and before I know it he's handing out ball caps from his hotel to each of us as a gift.Then he offers to escort us to the club (we were early and our room wasn't quite ready). My daughter was holding a few posters from Hamilton and The Phantom (we saw both the previous two nights), and we spoke briefly of our stay, letting him know we had one more play to see before heading home (Anastasia).And this is where The Ritz-Carlton shows that, like Porsche, it has no substitute.We head out to dinner (at the fabulous Quality Meats - no the name doesn't do it justice - which the concierge recommended), and then to the play. We get back to our room around 11:00pm. And then...Remember that ""special something"" I mentioned earlier - the one that makes one feel special, and cared for? While we were gone, Ender took it upon himself to go shopping. He purchased not one, not two, but all three soundtracks of the plays we saw while in NY!!! We opened the door to find them displayed on the entertainment center - and he had Anastasia playing on the Bose speaker system in the room!!!WHAT? Are you kidding me? WHO DOES THAT? With I don't know how many thousands of people that go in and out of that hotel, and this is the kind of attention we get? And note - I didn't reserve a suite - we were in a regular room!Never, and I mean NEVER have we ever been made to feel so special and wanted at a hotel (or any other establishment for that matter). Staring down at the thoughtful gifts and listening to the music of the play we just watched on Broadway, I watched my daughter wipe a tear from her eye. We were all touched by the gesture. In today's world, this just doesn't happen.It was then that I turned to my fiancé and declared that we would never again visit New York City without staying at The Ritz-Carlton Central Park....

We visit New York City frequently and stay at 5 star hotels. This was our first time at the Ritz Central Park location. It is certainly well located in Manhattan, within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants, top tier retail stores, the Theater District and of course Central Park. We had very nice large room facing Central Park. However at the 8th floor level we were not high enough to see over the trees to see much of the park. If you want a better park view get a room on a much higher floor. We ate breakfast every day in the hotel. The basic ""American Breakfast"" (two eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes. juice and coffee) was tasty but at $50 per person is a bit high priced even for New York City standards. This is especially true in light of the fact that you can get basically the same breakfast next door at a diner for $6.95.We wanted to try dining at the hotel during the evening but were scared away because we never saw anyone else eating there. We did have a couple of late night hamburgers in the bar area which were fine as most hamburgers taste but at $30 a burger, we expected better quality from the Ritz.The service provided by the front desk, concierge and by the doormen were excellent. We have stayed at other Ritz Carlton's and have always been impressed with these type services. The bar service and dining room service was spotty however. A couple of times we had to flag a server down to get a coffee refill, another time the server brought the check with the breakfast, and still another, we asked for some A1 sauce which never arrived. The bar service was equally spotty with long waits for service despite the fact that there were not that many customers to warrant the delay. Granted, these are not major complaints but for a $800 a day room and high prices for basic food, we expected better from this Ritz Carlton.As with any review, I post, I intend it to be helpful to potential travelers and also constructive criticism for the management to consider. I am in business myself and I want to know how I am doing so I can improve. To this end, if I ran the Ritz Carlton chain of properties, I would model each hotel after the Ritz Carlton in Cancun for service and quality of food. To this day, it had the best of each in all our 40 plus years of visiting top tier hotels.","Louisville, Kentucky","derbycityvisitor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",126,4.0

Ritz Carlton's Central Park spot may be my favorite so far. The location is ideal, situation right in front of the park and within walking distance of Broadway. You're near Fifth Avenue and most of the prominent museums in the city. The rooms are luxurious, and the staff is equipped to match your needs. For those trying to choose between this and the Battery Park location, if money isn't a major issue, I would totally go with this one. The rooms are nicer, and the location just can't be beat. The ambience of the Ritz Carlton brand is so much more apparent at this location and carries that feeling of luxury I feel sometimes absent from the other one. After staying at Ritz Carlton properties in a number of cities, I've come to expect some surprises. In the past, I've arrived to free food, magazines, and other items in my room after a long day. That wasn't the case here, but to be completely fair, I never requested such and this location is much more in-demand than some of their other properties who want to spoil guests to lure them back for repeat business. Overall, you can't go wrong. I was very pleased with my visit and will certainly return.","Nashville, Tennessee","alexbeene</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",10,5.0

But NYC really raised the bar on this most recent trip. I made my reservations through the website, and was happy with our rate for a regular, non-park view room. About a week before, I got an email from guest services asking if we were celebrating anything, and whether we needed help making plans. I responded that we were celebrating my son's first trip to the city, and a milestone birthday for my husband. I also provided my ""in process"" itinerary, asking if they might assist in filling in some holes in my schedule. I received a response noting our celebrations, and suggesting some good things to do. When we checked in, we were a bit disappointed with the size of the room, and the view inside an interior court yard. We are gold members and often get upgraded. But, all was forgotten when we saw the lovely treat they left for my son welcoming him to the city. On my husband's birthday we returned from dinner after seeing Hamilton to be surprised with the soundtrack playing on the CD, and a birthday treat for my husband. All that attention, but never feeling like the staff was ""in our face"" is a wonderful balance that is hard to get right. The coffee in the lobby was delicious. Food in the restaurant was great. Location is tough to beat. Easy walk to Rockefeller Plaza and Broadway. The front of the property could get a little stinky with the horses across the street, but it's part of the charm, I guess. We were absolutely impressed with this property. And we are getting harder and harder to impress. We will be back.

They do have a coffee cart for complimentary coffee in the am. Be aware the hallways are not air-conditioned and they had to put fans in the hallway to move the air. The room is just a room with a comfy bed and a lovely bathroom. I used the tub to cool off after a hot day in the city. A couple of tips. Go to the Plaza food court just down the street to catch a bite to eat. Many different food choices and when in town we always stop in usually for lunch before hitting Bergdorf's.

I have stayed in many Ritz Carlton's (Aruba, New Orleans, NYC - Battery Park, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Washington DC, Toronto). This was my first trip to NYC - Central Park. This was Reward Travel as well, we were upgraded to a Deluxe Room, with Park view for a small fee on top of the Ritz Carlton reward points. Even though the room was not booked with American Express Reward Points, we were extended a few of the Centurion benefits as if it were. I was traveling with my sons 7 & 9. It was a basketball weekend in the city. Service, as always, was exemplary, but even more so at this location. I was greeted by name at check in, my children were greeted and introduced to several members of the staff, each of these staff members remembered their names throughout the stay. The children were given plush horses as a gift and invited to some Ritz Kids events that they passed on, excepting the feeding of the horses at noon. My youngest really enjoyed that every day of our stay. Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The mechanics on the windows did not operate properly and engineering came up to assist, and got them closed tight, but advised against operating them as the mechanics were stripped. Some of the upholstery on the chairs and stools were worn. The desk was perplexing as there were no receptacles for laptops, chargers or anything easily accessible. FREE (with Marriott elite status) WiFi was very fast. It was quite pricey $20 a day, if you had to pay for it though. I had to use the business center to print some show tickets, I found the need to use a credit card and the ridiculous $3 fee to use the internet in the business center a bit disparaging, but everything there worked perfectly.The bathroom, was elegant, and my only issue was with the makeup mirror, the light did not work. I needed it to put in my contacts, not a big deal, but it should work. The kids loved the deep soaking tub and the shower that provided great pressure. Extra towels and toiletries were made available daily just as we requested. Ice was also provided daily for a cooler we had brought, for kid stuff. We ate breakfast in the restaurant Auden, the breakfast was very pricey and just ok. Pancakes were served cold, eggs were cold, toast was cold. Bacon was delicious. Total for 1 adult, 2 kids - $100. Service was a bit over the top, but quite friendly. The concierge was knowledgeable and quite helpful on several occasions. Front desk was attentive to our concerns. The bellman and doorman seem a bit perturbed by guests using Uber & Lyft, to arrange transportation, but I have found that the norm in city hotels these days. They were in no way rude about it, just could tell they feel like they are being squeezed out of a job a bit. The Detroit Pistons were in town staying at the hotel, several team members and coaches were very nice to the kids. They seemed to appreciate the accommodations and remarked to me that they enjoy the hotel on their trips to NY. All in all a very nice stay. I wouldn't say the hotel physically, is as nice as some other properties, I would say that you are paying mostly for location here. The staff is top notch though and while some things are a bit dated, service never goes out of style and that is why I stay at Ritz properties.","West Pittston, Pennsylvania","JimWPPA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Pittston, Pennsylvania</strong>",95,5.0

He had been to NYC before but had never been to the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where as I have stayed there and eaten there on a previous visits to NY. As we are based in the UK I organised everything via email and liaised with a lovely and extremely helpful lady named Rachel K!! We were booked to be in NY over the 4th July holiday period so in between organising a date/time for the afternoon tea booking I was also asking Rachel numerous other questions about where to go, what to see other than the normal touristy landmarks. Rachel was extremely helpful and went way beyond what she needed to in helping with our trip.We had our afternoon tea in the Star Lounge area of the hotel, the décor is beautiful, traditional but not old fashioned, it is designed in a very luxurious, classy style. Our afternoon tea was absolutely beautiful, how it was presented, how it tasted and how it was served to us by the staff there. Sadly Rachel wasn’t working the day we were there but the staff that were working on the day were a credit to the hotel, we had excellent customer service. Drinks were topped up regularly, check backs were done throughout our meal but never in an intrusive way and we were extremely well looked after. As this was for my partner’s birthday Rachel had also organised a couple of little extras on how the desserts were presented to us, a few extra chocolate goodies, we had a chocolate Empire State Building which we thought was a very lovely touch.Afternoon Tea at the Ritz- Carlton is not cheap (around £170 for ours) but it was worth every penny (dollar), would I do this again yes absolutely. The food was amazing, it doesn’t look much when it is brought out but there is definitely plenty there and it is very filling. I can honestly say there is nothing we could have complained about during our afternoon there, it is a beautiful hotel, the service and standards were extremely high and we were very much looked after. The only downside was that we didn’t see Rachel on the day we were booked, but luckily we still had time during our holiday to call in and say thank you for arranging this for us. Rachel K is a credit to the hotel, nothing was too much trouble for her and she was more than helpful regarding all the emails I was sending backwards and forwards to her regarding other questions not just about the afternoon tea.If you are visiting NYC we would definitely recommend you must experience Afternoon Tea at the Ritz-Carlton…and ask for Rachel K.","Yorkshire, United Kingdom","Holimoli18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",75,5.0

We have stayed at other Rita's and you normally sleep on air in their beds - extremely comfortable due to all sorts of comfortable layers. These beds however were very hard with just a feather topper on it, and I slept poorly each night as a result. Maybe it's just me, so I won't call this a show stopper but I think it's something management should invest in so you get that Ritz Sleeping experience. Anyway, the staff were great as was the Club Level, which was on the second floor and had a nice view of the Park.

Our room with a park view was ok but the bathroom was the best part. A nice soaking tub. Except it was broken.

After 4 visits from the (very lovely and helpful) handyman, our room was finally in working order.

Must say, though, that the rooms are starting to look a little worn. Miss having the beside plugins for electronics and other minor upgrades, aka RC in Boston. Our visit this trip was fine but not quite up to prior stays. We come every year for Christmas for a long -- sometimes short -- weekend. In years past, the front desk would welcome us back and they would make sure we got a room with two double beds. I booked online so not sure what went wrong with the reservation but we didn't get the correct room and no acknowledgement of our annual return. Not a huge deal but in the past, it was a nice touch. Our program status was not helpful either. We arrived late in the evening so I called down to ask what time the lounge stopped serving food. I was told 12:30 but when we got downstairs, we were told 12. Thankfully our waiter was nice enough to take our order anyway even though the head waiter scolded him for helping us out. Jenny Liu checked us out and she was very nice. Gave us her card and offered to help with the reservation next time.

I had requested a room with two beds, as there are three of us, along the parade route. When we arrived we were told that the rooms along the parade route would be an additional $1000 per night. We were also told there were no double bed rooms available, so we agreed to be in a room with one bed and a rollaway. We waited for three hours for our room to be cleaned and finally checked into our room with one bed on the park side. There was a strong odor when checked in our room due to a spray that housekeeping uses. The smell was so strong it was making us cough, so we tried to open the window which required a call to maintenance. Unfortunately after maintenance left we were unable to close and they had to come back to close it. We had to do this every time we wanted to open and close the window. We were told we would receive a rollaway bed; however, after waiting several hours, we were told there were none left. This meant all three of us (my husband, 10 year old son and myself), had to sleep in one bed. In my opinion, one of the best things Ritz has to offer is their bed. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The bed was the most uncomfortable Ritz bed I had ever slept in due to a very large ridge in the middle of the bed. We were told there we would receive a rollaway bed; however, after waiting several hours, were told there were none available. There were also several other maintenance issues. The sink in the bathroom wouldn't drain and the light in the bathroom blew out which required another call to maintenance. The second night we were given a rollaway bed, which made an already very small room much more cramped. My husband slept in the rollaway and I slept in the bed with my 10 year old as the bed was that uncomfortable. The third morning we were awoken by a phone call from the assistant manager Lindsay telling us she needed us to move to an inside room as she had someone that was requesting a park view room. I told her that there was no way we were moving after I finally got a rollaway bed and had everything in the room repaired. I couldn't believe how rude she was. I was not losing any more precious time in the city to pack and move just to convenience her. I couldn't even believe someone would have the nerve to ask. I asked to speak to her manager, and he immediately said that we would not need to move. The assistant manager is definitely in the wrong profession. We had limited time to spend in the city as we were only there over the Thanksgiving Holiday. When I think of all the time lost due to all the inconveniences it makes me sad. I wish we could get that time back as there was so much we didn't get to do. Other than the assistant manager, everyone was lovely including Jenny at the desk, the doormen and the house driver. It's too bad that one bad apple can ruin the whole bunch. ",Brighton ,"WhiteX3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brighton </strong>",48,3.0

It is a lovely hotel in a wonderful location. The service used to be a positive aspect. This time was different. The check in was strange. Someone left a package for us and the concierge seems confused and put upon. In addition while another couple was offered bottled water at check in we were not. We also noticed that we had to open the main doors for ourselves, coming into and out of the hotel. That isn't hard to do, but different from our past experiences. Our suite was strange. We did not get a park view and that was perhaps the problem. However, the configuration of the room was more like two adjoining rooms rather than a suite. There was no flow and it certainly didn't feel like an indulgence. The rate is 2000/night, so perhaps based on location we should not have expected more. The view from the bedroom was of the other side of the building and in between was a filthy outdoor space. We were on the 4th floor, that made it worse. It was really unappealing. We kept the shades drawn and it was kind of unpleasant. We ordered room service and the food was not great. We mentioned it at checkout and they did not seem interested. Overall it seemed more like a 3 star hotel. We will be looking for another hotel for future trips to NYC.

The Club is on the second floor next to the wonderful La Prairie Spa ( treat yourself, you won't regret it). The service at the Club is not to be found at any other hotel in NYC. The food presentations could use a little more variety but they are still delightful as well as cocktails, wine and champagne.

You know what you're getting. But, on another point, be careful as you may not know what you will be getting for a specific room once you are in the hotel. We had a very odd experience here. I booked a room with two queen beds and a view of the park. I booked it online, and then called the hotel directly to confirm. When we got there, they told us no such room was available and took us to a king - bedded room. When we protested , in a polite, not hostile way, they took us to a double queen room facing an air shaft. Eventually a manager relocated us to a nice suite (which by the way STILL did not have the bedding we requested - I slept on the pull out couch) but not before insulting us and accusing us of being rude to his staff, which we most definitely were not. He was the most obnoxious man! The only thing that saved the day was a lovely room service butler (Stavros?) who brought us a bottle of wine, apologized for the hotel's mistake, and really demonstrated what service was all about.

People are quick to damn and slow to praise.We moved to The Ritz Carlton Central Park South for 6 days after 5 days at The Crosby Street Hotel Soho. We did this to experience two different areas of NYC as we have done 3 times before on our trips to NY and it works well for us.New York was in the middle of its third heatwave this summer and although a newer hotel, The Crosby air conditioning was fantastic from the nightmare heat.However, we were so sorry we left it as The Ritz Carton's aircon was abysmal and unable to cope, especially in our lovely room overlooking the park.The engineer who came to help, changed the filter and said that 18.5 degrees Celsius was the lowest setting and he couldn't help further. It was completely unacceptable and made sleeping very difficult as on high speed the noise from it was not tolerable either. It took 24 hours to reach something like 22 degrees Celsius which still was uncomfortable.We complained further, to no avail.The hallways were unbearable with no apparent air con at all, but one only had to tolerate this in order to get to the elevator from the room.As it wasn't possible to stay outside for more than 10 minutes without difficulty in breathing, our plans to walk and see the sites and use the most beautiful park in the world were curtailed. Everyone was suffering, even the hotel's doormen.This climate and temperature is not the first time NY has experienced such heat and humidity. ""Fourteen of the fifteen hottest years have occurred since 2000 as heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense and more longer lasting"". (The New York Times. Aug 20th. 2016) . So, not exactly a new phenomenon for NYC or the hotel.The Ritz Carlton is an oldand clearly in need of much renovation which is obviously happening soon.But, to expect guests to put up with such conditions when clearly this has been experienced by the hotel before is unsupportable.Inexplicably, The Auden restaurant's aircon blasted such Arctic air that it was impossible to eat there without returning to one's room to get a jacket and long pants......the contrast from the rest of the hotel such an outrageous anomaly.I sincerely believe that the hotel morally owed it's incoming guests an explanation and apology about the poor functioning air conditioning in the extreme heat and humidity. Then, possibly the ethical thing to do was to offer them alternative accommodation, should they choose.But, this probably would have meant a certain loss of income at a relatively quiet time in the city?",Sydney,"Maxine S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",19,2.0

Housekeeping maintained it well throughout our stay. Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with the club lounge. It was very small and we often struggled to find somewhere to sit. Drinks service was slow and our preferences were not remembered and breakfast and the food presentations were extremely limited and repetitious.

To be fair, my 6-year daughter and I stayed only one night. I redeemed 70,000 Marriott points for the stay. The hotel was smaller than I expected, but nicely furnished. The hotel was unable to give me the complimentary upgrade I was entitled to due to it being unavailable. When I asked if I could be upgraded to the next available room, they said it would cost $900 for the upgrade. No thanks. The room I was given (an interior room with no view) was quite large at approximately 500 square feet. It was well appointed, but in need of refreshing as the bedskirt and wall fabric had some stains. The hotel's location is great. We were so close to Central Park, the Time Warner Building, and Times Square. I will say that I was disappointed by the hotel's service. Last month we traveled to the Ritz Carlton Naples for nine days and perhaps, we were spoiled by Naples' superior service. In comparison, the Ritz Carlton New York was lacking. However, my daughter loved feeding the horses outside and was gifted a Matilda soundtrack which we listened to on our drive home. I will say that the size of the room and the location makes this hotel very desirable. I would consider returning just to take advantage of those two benefits but I would not pay the rack rate for them.","long island, ny","am470</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>long island, ny</strong>",86,3.0

A Ritz visit has long been our favorite splurge. We honeymooned at Ritz Kapalua, had our first anniversary at Ritz St. Thomas and are regular visitors of their Toronto property. So when we chose NYC for our second anniversary, Ritz Carlton's Central Park property was our first choice. There is no service like Ritz Carlton service. Full stop. This property was no exception, and we were thrilled with the front desk and maid service folks. We opted for access to the concierge lounge, which turned out to be very disappointing. I found the staff to be very stuffy (despite the sometimes stuffy clientele, the concierge lounge staff has, at other RC properties, proven to be super friendly). The food selection was atrocious -- small flavorless appetizers, food running out, etc. The drink selection was also quite sparse. The NYC culinary scene is daunting. I tried to use the concierge for restaurant recommendations, but wasn't impressed with anything they recommended. I explicitly asked for 'local' recommendations (i.e. nothing touristy) and was continually referred to overpriced, underdelivering restaurants. Eventually, I just did the leg work myself. From a location perspective, now knowing the layout of Manhattan, I would avoid staying near Central Park. Everything that's 'happening' is south of Central Park, and my wife and I found that we spent hardly any time at all in or around the hotel.

Plenty of closet and drawer space in the bedroom and more space than two women needed for all of our toiletries in the bathroom! My only complaint with the room was the hair dryer. I almost always travel with my own but this time I chose to leave it at home to save space in my carry on bag. The dryer provided produced almost no heat and the little bit that it did provide came along with hurricane force winds. I even requested a replacement and they bet quickly brought a brand new dryer up, still in the box. They get points for that, but alas it was only marginally better than the older model. A very small issue as I can always bring my own. A nice touch was the free shoe shine service that is provided nightly. Place your shoes in a bag outside your room and they are returned prior to 7am, nicely shined, no charge! Check in was a breeze. We arrived several hours prior to check in time and they had a room ready for us within 45 minutes. Late checkout (2:30) was provided as well so we could stay until we had to leave for the airport.

I did book a club lounge room and we were upgraded to a deluxe room. I will always get a club lounge access room, well worth the money, the food there is enough for meals and delicious. Before our stay I worked with guest services to arrange a small surprise cocktail party with local friends at the Lamb's Club before the play Hamilton. They were helpful in arranging that party there. When we got back from the show, there was a birthday cake for my husband with music playing from the show and a CD from Hamilton as well! The customer service in the club lounge is fantastic. After we checked out of the hotel and were at the airport in Teterboro, NJ. I realized I left my wedding ring and engagement ring in the bathroom on the sink back at the hotel. I immediately called the club lounge and spoke with Felix who along with security found the rings. They then arranged a driver to bring me the rings in a secure envelop to the airport where I met the driver. Yes, I had to pay for the car service to bring my rings to me, but the outstanding customer service to find the rings and deliver them to me was above and beyond! This will be our only hotel now to stay at while visiting NYC. Thanks to Felix and all the great staff in guest services, I can't thank you enough for finding my rings and delivering them to me, I was beyond frantic.

We're not anyone special, but we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived to the minute the doorman helped us into our cab on our way to the airport. And while I'll admit that the cost of the experience caused us -- at a couple of points -- to think twice about staying there again, what they did for us on our special night totally blew us away and reaffirmed the Ritz-Carlton as our hotel of choice in New York City.A few basics: The Ritz-Carlton is located just south of Central Park. While the exterior isn't much to look at, the interior is elegant and classy. It has a peaceful, classical feel. We even loved the art! Unlike some other hotels the lobby is fairly simple with just the front desk and the concierge. There is a restaurant/rest area that we didn't eat at but enjoyed walking through. There is a tiny gift shop behind the concierge desk we didn't enter. There is a spa which we didn't use but I toured it and it looks beautiful, modern and very spa like. The fitness center was impressive. The men's locker room felt like a men's club.Our room was beautiful. We had a courtyard view room -- which, on the high floor we were on, meant that we couldn't actually see anything other than other people's windows. I will say in ALL fairness that there are plenty of rooms that face the park -- we just didn't want to pay for them! I certainly don't blame the lack of view on the hotel in any way, shape or form. But I will say that if city views or park views are really important to you, then less expensive courtyard rooms at the Ritz-Carlton may not be for you -- you should either pony up the cash for the view or maybe consider staying somewhere else.The room itself was BEAUTIFUL. A mix of modern amenities in a very classical shell. The walls were covered with framed fabric -- I don't know what you call it, but it was pretty. All of the furnishings were what you would expect from an modern, luxury hotel so I'm not going to go into those. But I will say that the bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom and as far as I can tell it was completely up-to-date. The shower was about the best shower I've ever experienced and it made me re-evaluate our own shower heads at home which up until now we really thought were great.No complaints about the room, the location, or the amenities. What about the service?Look, the service is WHY you stay at a Ritz-Carlton. It was (and always is) the best part of our experience. Sure, everyone is nice. But they go beyond nice. Every single person we came in contact with clearly, consistently WANTED to know how THEY could make our experience at the hotel better.When we checked in they casually asked why we were in town. ""For our anniversary,"" we replied. ""Oh, and because we are seeing Hamilton!"" Good news -- they had a town car that could take us to the show. Great, we thought. We left our stuff in the room and went off to get dinner.When we returned, there was a bottle of champagne in our room and a personal note congratulating us on our anniversary. ""Awww,"" we said -- really touched. But I'll admit we weren't surprised. That's kind of what we have come to expect from the Ritz-Carlton.What BLEW US AWAY was what happened on the night we went to see Hamilton. First, they gave us a ride to the show. They didn't charge us (we did tip of course...we're not savages). The show great. We took a cab back to the hotel afterwards, still humming our favorite songs. We went up to our room, opened the door and....huh? My wife's favorite song from the show was playing in our room.Whaa? At first we were REALLY confused. How was that even possible? Sitting on the desk next to the CD player was the soundtrack from the show and a card from one of the hotel's guest relations agents. They of course knew where we were, knew what we were doing and went out of their way to make an already incredible night even MORE amazing. Wow. Wow. Wow. I should note, by the way, that my wife's favorite song was playing on repeat. How they knew is was magic (or maybe everyone likes the same song...I don't know. I prefer to think it was just magic).How often does a hotel successfully write itself into the narrative of an already incredible memory by doing something so unexpected and wonderful? It was a great surprise, and certainly will make us think twice next time we're considering another hotel. So...to sum up: great hotel, great location. Incredible, amazing service. Great place to go for a very special occasion -- or, great place to go if you want to be treated like royalty even when you're not. It's expensive, but still an great value when you consider level of service you receive. We will definitely stay there again.","Southlake, Texas","kupferman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southlake, Texas</strong>",3,5.0

Our 7th floor suite overlooked the treetops of Central Park. It was perfect in every way, from the view, to the beautiful furnishings and spacious rooms. The best part, though, was the gracious staff. They went out of their way to help us celebrate, right down to having the soundtrack to a show we went to see queued up on the CD player when we got back. This was the kindest, most attentive staff we've ever had at any hotel we've stayed at (and we've stayed at some pretty great hotels).

The problem, as I see it, is that the Marriott, or whomever owns it at this time, don't seem to recognize previous guests or keep track of your information accurately, like a guest appreciation program should. The hotel, as a gauge against other similar properties, such as The Surrey, Carlyle, Mandarin or The Regis, has a premium location on Central Park. It's incredibly quiet and they have an attentive staff.Pros: The bartender has no peers. The property is comfortable and, if you're on the park, rooms have incredible views. Cons: Their customer ""appreciation"" system needs some work. For instance, we've stayed here numerous times and there is no record of us being here for years on end, even though we were here six months ago. The room we were just ""assigned"" is quite a bit smaller than the previous rooms we've paid for. If you're in the AMEX program, that can be a bit disappointing (although it seems that if you've stayed in a hotel before, you naturally compare your previous room to the one you're currently assigned). If that is the gauge, then these guys fail, but if you're a first time guest staying in any room that looks onto the park, it's incredible. Don't opt for the club lounge, it's not that great as club lounges go, and if it's more expensive than the room you've chosen, skip it.Do upgrade to a park view; we've stayed in the back of the hotel, and although it's quiet, it's dark and the view onto the park is exquisite.We haven't tried the new restaurant yet but it looks ""clubby"" and red-leather-ish. The gym is always adequately equipped as city hotel gyms go and we sometimes pick this hotel just for the gym. The spa is also great. We always joke that ""it's not the Four Seasons,"" which seems ironic since the Ritz Carlton built their whole reputation on over-the-top service.If you get a good deal on the room, jump on it.",,rkr727,177,3.0

From Ander at the front desk who walked me up to my room and made sure I was well cared for to the assistant manager that I ran into in the hallway and road down in the elevator with who told me he would check me out if I gave him my room number.

We booked a 'city view room'. Don't expect panoramic views of New York though. Our room looked out mostly on to the building opposite but with a good partial view of Central Park. I have had much better views at much cheaper US hotels. The room was nice rather than stunning and the individual staff service was always polite and friendly. However, we were excluded from the bar, lobby and restaurant one evening with not a great deal of warning due to Euretha Franklin's birthday function. During afternoon tea (which was seriously underwhelming and I would not waste the money on) there was a foul mouthed business man on the next table ranting and f'ing on the phone which spoilt the ambience somewhat. I did ask staff to speak to him as there were also children present. However, they would not do this as he was a good customer who obviously put a great deal of money their way. Therein lies a problem in that the big spenders obviously have priority over the little folk like us - not good really when we, proportionately speaking, have also spent a small fortune to stay there. Another point is that the price of food is frankly an insult to one's intelligence and the choice is poor. Including tax and 'auto gratuity' (don't bother adding additional gratuity is it seems to be added for you here) we paid on average 150 dollars for two sandwiches with fries and a couple of average deserts before you get on to spending on any drinks. Afternoon tea worked out at around 180 dollars for what was very underwhelming. Do yourself a favour and eat out - much cheaper and more choice. So, all in all, nice hotel but very poor value for money generally and get ready to be treated like a second class citizen if you are not dripping gold!","Preston, United Kingdom","Edward P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston, United Kingdom</strong>",46,3.0

Before we even arrived, we started experiencing the Ritz's amazing customer services. I responded to an email about the purpose of our stay, etc. I mentioned my daughter's birthday and literally within five minutes I received an email from Cassidy Davis (one of Ritz's Guest Recognition Coordinators). She asked us questions about our daughter's favorite color, dessert and interests. When we arrived, our room was ready for early check-in (as we requested) and we were greeted with balloons (in my daughter's favorite color), some amazing cupcakes and two coloring books featuring my daughter's favorite Disney characters. She was so incredibly excited and happy when she saw all of this. Another example of how the Ritz really goes above and beyond - in the evening when we headed out for dinner, my daughter (having missed her afternoon nap) started to have a bit of a meltdown and started crying in the lobby. One of the doormen immediately went and got two stuffed animals and gave one to her one to my younger infant son. He also offered some soothing, comforting words to my daughter and she immediately calmed down. These are just a couple of examples of how the Ritz made us feel incredibly welcome during our entire stay. The room and amenities at the Ritz were superior (as you would expect).

From the moment you set foot into the hotel, you are welcomed by courteous, polite and smiling staff who will take your luggage and escort you to reception. After check-in, concierge will escort you to your room. This was actually a really nice touch after a long flight and nightmare journey in due to traffic: the man who took us to our room was really friendly and chatty and i though it made for a very warming welcome without being too much.Our room was on the 9th floor and had a side view on Central Park and the opposite building. I believe there are higher rooms with a full view of the park though that didn't really bother me. In terms of size, the room was very spacious including a super comfortable and large double bed, marble bathroom with walk-in shower and a separate toilet.Room also has a minibar, TV and benefits from turn down service every night.The decor of the room and the hotel in general is very upscale and classy, though it all looks a bit 90s (though everything is very well kept and not tired looking - I think the hotel would just benefit from a little refresh).The hotel restaurant is amazing - staff are so polite and welcoming and the food is fantastic albeit rather pricey. A breakfast for two can cost you over $150!There is also a small gym onsite equipped with weights, machines and treadmills which is always a bonus - unfortunately there are no spa facilities but that really wasn't an issue for me.In terms of location, the hotel is 2 minutes from 5th Avenue and a short walk from the subway so it's really well connected.I had a fantastic stay at the Ritz Carlton - it really made a difference to my stay in NYC and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting the city!","London, United Kingdom","Unlabeled</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

The overall theme of my review is incredibly inconsistent service. Upon arrival, no one was manning the front door. No bellman, nothing. The weather was below freezing and it was very difficult to manage my luggage while trying not to catch hypothermia and get the incredibly heavy front door open. Not a good first impression. However the following three days there were several doormen manning the doors, who were very nice and helpful. The Room They were able to give me an early check in... To the room closest to the elevator (1009) with zero cell phone reception. The wifi was spotty and with no cell reception, communication to the outside world during my stay was a challenge. This room was also somewhat loud due to the proximity to the elevator. The decor is very traditional but also very dated. I think this place is definitely due for a refresh. On my first night there were 4 small waters delivered with turndown service. I never received water again until the fourth night, got 2 waters with turndown and then no water the last night. Very inconsistent. My bathroom door had something that looked like smeared blood on the door surrounding the handle. I grabbed a housekeeper from the hall as soon as I found it, pointed it out to her and she wiped it. However after she left, there was still stained residue on the door. Meaning she only half way cleaned it up. GROSS! No one ever cleaned it during my 5 day stay. Room service was $100 for a pot of coffee and oatmeal with a side of berries. I'm not sure how that is possible but it is. The food was just so-so. One afternoon during the blizzard we had friends come to visit us and we sat for cocktails in the lobby. My sister and I eventually got hungry and grabbed salads from a nearby take out spot (Chop'd - great salads). Once we started eating, a hotel woman came over and asked us if we were staying in the hotel, to which we responded ""yes."" She then told us we couldn't eat in the lobby because it's hard for them to know who in the lobby is and is not a hotel guest. Note this is the only area to sit in the lobby. We asked her what we should do and she told us we would have to eat our salads in our room. Even though we were drinking drinks from the lobby bar and had a colleague visiting (with whom it would have been very awkward to have sitting on my bed in my hotel room while I ate a salad). We packed up and left the lobby (furious) and called the manager. She apologized and sent us a bottle of sparkling wine and told us that was not their policy in the lobby and that the woman was mistaken. We sought assistance with show and event tickets from the concierge but found that their prices far exceeded StubHub tickets, so we bought them on our own. In summary, the service was quite inconsistent and hotel seems to need a refresh in decor/cleanliness and retraining of several staff members. With all the great places to stay in NY, I will not return to this hotel. ","San Francisco, California","Arielkelleysf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",1,2.0

Information on car services and cakes and balloons to a detailed and thoughtful list of restaurants nearby. I never felt like I was imposing with so many questions and, quite honestly, continually felt that she was just as excited as I was that this trip be a special one.Valet parking is made extremely convenient for the guests - just pull up and someone will take your bags and take your car for you. Check in was warm and welcoming. (Thank you Ms. Myers) It was as if we were old friends coming back again.

The cake was ready in the room. And there were even balloons to make it extra fun.Everything was perfect and not a single detail was overlooked. When I mentioned that we would not be having the cake until later, a refrigerator was immediately sent up to keep the cake perfect until we returned later that evening.We booked a Deluxe Park View room and the room and view were spectacular!

The temperature in the room was never too hot or cold - I could not find a single complaint about it if I tried.We loved the location of the hotel. The park and the skating rink and the shops on 5th Avenue and restaurants and it was very quiet in the evening, which made sleeping much more pleasant than other hotels we've stayed at in Manhattan. Just perfection.We went down to the bar to have a couple of cocktails prior to leaving for a concert and little did we know that we were about to have a brush with greatness. Norman is the epitome of the quintessential old school New York City bartender. His skills and personality are everything to the point where we did not even want to leave for the concert! We are both grateful to have had the opportunity to meet him and hope to again in the future. We would return to this Ritz Carlton for a thousand reasons - and Norman is absolutely at the top of the list.I can not say enough about the service here. Every single person we came in contact with was knowledgeable and professional and friendly. That includes valet parking and the doormen, bell services, the front desk, concierge services, housekeeping, room service, the bartenders - every single person.We did finally manage to pry ourselves away from Norman to leave for the Billy Joel concert. My fabulous contact person had made me aware of the house car and we were fortunate to have it available at time prior to the concert to take us to Madison Square Garden. The driver was made aware in advance that the location we were going to should not be disclosed as it was a birthday surprise. Again - not a single detail was overlooked.When we returned to the room that evening - there was a Billy Joel CD playing in the room. There was also a children's book wrapped in a bow. And then a hand-written note saying that she hoped we enjoyed the concert and would continue to enjoy the music back in our room and with hopes that reading the book to my grandson would bring back a fond memory of our visit.We were absolutely blown away.I did not even recall mentioning my grandson. But obviously I did. And obviously she was listening to me and to every single thing I said.Attention to the details is everything to me. That is where good customer service becomes extraordinary stellar EPIC customer service.Bravo, Ritz Carlton.BravoThere has not been a single person that I've shared this experience with that was not beyond impressed with the service we received.It has been exactly two weeks now since our stay at this hotel and I still smile every time I think about it. I recommend to anyone who will listen to make it a point to stay at this hotel when visiting New York City. I will never forget this place and these people and we will absolutely be returning in the future. We couldn't imagine staying anywhere else.Thank you Ms. Carreno-Urena for making our stay a wonderful memory that will last us a lifetime. Thank you for giving us the best customer service and the best hotel experience we've ever had. You made it all look effortless and you a truly gifted and an invaluable asset to the Ritz Carlton.Until next time, Ritz Carlton Central Park - Thank you!",New Jersey,"shamrock0421</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",282,5.0

We were all pretty disappointed and underwhelmed by the Ritz Carlton, especially given we were paying USD1,50 a night for our suite. Firstly, incredibly Wifi was not included but extra, and per person. And when I questioned this they provided us a free code which whilst good simply highlighted the out-of-touch policy and very strange reactive-approach to customer service! Secondly, we asked for our extra kids beds to be setup at 5pm. Come 5pm, nothing. I had to call at 6 and ask again. Thirdly, no extra towels were included in our room for the 3 kids, even after the extra beds were setup. Again, I had to call and ask. The TVs were fuzzy. The heating noisy. It just all felt very out-of-date and not worth it. It's as if the staff felt they could lazily sit-back and think that their old brand name was a privilege enough in itself. Very odd. To be clear, much of the experience was nicely done and there was some OK service. But given we had been staying in fantastic stylish hotels earlier in our trip that were half the price and twice as nice, I really don't know why you'd bother with this old classic (even given its location on the park).

We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. We had a standard room with two double beds located in the back of the hotel. There was no view to speak of but that didn't matter. The room was very spacious. The room included a large foyer, ample closet and drawer space and a small sitting area. The large marble bathroom had a deep tub, a large shower and a toilet room. Every imaginable toiletry was provided. The beds were well equipped with luxury duvet and linens. The service was impeccable. We mentioned to the room steward in passing that we were going to see Wicked on Broadway on our first night. After the play upon returning to the room, we heard music from the play coming from the CD player in the room. The room steward, Ronald, left us the CD from Wicked along with a lovely note. What a wonderful gesture. We ordered room service twice. Each time our order arrived hot and on time. The food was so good. The crab salad sandwich is amazing. I had it two nights in a row. However, the price of room service is too much for me (I'm not the typical Ritz customer). Each night our order exceeded $160 for a burger, an omelette and a crab salad sandwich with three soft drinks and fries. It was really good though. The location was very convenient.

We were escorted to the lounge for a complimentary drink while we waited. I was hoping for a room upgrade which I always get with SPG but unfortunately not. We did however get a high floor and the room was awesome and roomy for NYC. Lots of nice amenities, very comfortable bed and a fridge in the room. The room was also super quiet and we got 3 glorious nights sleep so the view was not really that important. The first night home after dinner we had a bottle of champagne chilling with a spectacular fruit plate and balloons for our Anniversary it was a very nice touch. I do agree with the place is needing cosmetic upgrades but our room was very clean and I know they have renovations in the works. We did have high tea which I highly recommend doing. The food was wonderful as was the service. Reservations are an absolute must. One evening we did come back to have sandwiches in the lounge. The food was not great and the service wasn't as you would expect at a Ritz property. The last morning we had breakfast in the restaurant which was delicious and the service spectacular.

The rooms are a great size but you can't watch TV and have the air conditioner on at the same time due to the noise of the air conditioner! It may not really matter as the hotel only has 8 or 9 Digital TV channels the rest are analogue with such poor reception you can't really watch any shows! Seriously!Service within the hotel was inconsistent, which was interesting, however, after raising my concerns at the experience I received at the hotel, the Hotel Manager responded in a manner expected.At the prices charged it is also hard to understand why the hotel gouges on Internet charges in the business centre. The days for this type of behavior are well past.As a loyal Marriott customer I would not recommend the Ritz Carlton to anyone and perhaps suggest considering the JW Marriott a few doors away on 59th Street or an alternative hotel.Having recently stayed at the Marriott in Newport RI the Ritz Carlton management could learn a lot from this team.Disappointed!","Perth, Australia","3mL17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",55,2.0

The first time was for the NY marathon and the second was for business. Both rooms I had were very nice, although my most recent room was the best. It was on the 16th floor and had a Central Park view. It was definitely worth the extra cost because waking up to that view every morning was amazing. The rooms were large and decorated in the classic Ritz style. Same with the bathrooms - nice and large. Beds at the Ritz are very, very comfortable.Service was great as always. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.The restaurant, in my opinion, is just okay. I think they can do better. I've only had breakfast, but I think the food could be kicked up a notch or two. Instead, go two doors down to Sarabeth's - it's definitely a good alternative. The food in the club lounge was good. It was fun to sip on champagne while looking out and watching people at Central Park.I went to the spa for a manicure. The staff at the front were very nice. My manicurist was very friendly, professional and gave me a great manicure. They give you a class of champagne to sip on while relaxing and enjoying the treatment.While I was there, the elevators went down due to a fire alarm. Although I had to walk down 15 floors, the staff was very calm, professional and on top of trying to get the alarm turned off and the elevators working. Everyone has their favorites and I'm not stuck on just one type of chain hotel, but the Ritz is definitely a good choice. It's in the perfect location - across the street from Central Park, near great restaurants and the best shopping. The subway is also a couple of blocks away. And, if you like service, you'll like the Ritz.","Santa Barbara Island, California","TravelGirlAdventures</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Barbara Island, California</strong>",47,5.0

I was really looking forward to the high tea as I imagined it couldn't get better than high tea at such an exclusive hotel in the heart of New York. Unfortunately we were a bit dissapointed. The service was quite slow to start with although was more efficient towards the later part of our stay. The first course of the afternoon tea consisted of savoury sandwiches and pieces. We found these stale, dry and flavourless. The second course was freshly baked scone. It was nice but was hard to eat as it was so huge (about the size of 4 scones put together) and quite crumbly. The dessert petites were very nice. As it was our honeymoon , we were surprised with a small plate of chocolate petite fours which were complimentary. When paying, we factored in a tip and paid cash, a bit extra, however were never returned with any change. We were happy to tip the standard 20% but assuming a 30% tip was rude and presumptuous.

A special mention to the receptionist Orlando Ocampo who realised right away that I only had my accommodation booked that morning and asked why is that so. When he found out I was very disappointed with our room at Trump Soho, he right away went into action -""Since you had a hard time at Trump Soho, let me see if I can get you a very nice room...Oh, there's one but the occupants hasn't vacated yet. Can you wait for it to be vacated?"" I obliged. My sister and I went around Central Park just across the road and had a great time. @ 4:30 PM we went back and it didn't need for Orlando to show up but another bellman who right away recognized us and he said right away: ""Oh, welcome back Mrs. Hoyle, I have your keys ready for you."" It is really amazing when people do this extra attention to you as a guest - make the guest feel special. Then off we went to the 22nd floor and the rest is history....Love it here!

I just have to admit that it can't really compare to all the really luxurious hotels out there. It has many things in its favor: a great location on Central Park South, right opposite all those horse-drawn carriages and central park, near Bergdorf's and Barney's for those who like shopping, great strolling along Madison Ave. The staff are wonderful, and the Club option is a great value: the Club Room on the second floor serves great light breakfasts, lunches and dinner as part of your room cost and is a great way of avoiding restaurant hassle (though the Lobby Restaurant is good too, and has a lovely ambience). Prices, of course, are astronomical--that's just the way it is. But on our last stay, the worn-out beige color palette of all the rooms, and the empty space in most of them (as if there was a furniture shortage) couldn't help seem lack-luster in comparison to the brighter, more updated hotel rooms elsewhere. Everything (!) is beige--no color anywhere--floor, carpet, sofa, chair, curtains, bedspread, etc--and I really think the RC should be in line for a renovation. The other beef we had -- and this one is brand new -- is that our room *reeked* of cleaning product. We opened the door and were hit with a throat-gripping aroma that made us feel slightly queasy. It would get better during the night, but after each day's cleaning it was back. Are they cleaning the rooms with industrial-strength products? Why? It's hard to be comfortable when your room smells.I hope these complaints will be noticed by the RC management. There's no reason for such an excellent hotel to be going downhill in these regards, even if it remains top-notch in every other way.","Chicago, IL","TravelLovingProf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",84,4.0

I find this hotel to be charming, however it could use interior upgrades. Its location on the park is a big plus. If you prefer modern features, higher ceilings, updated interiors, a big lobby area or an impressive entrance - you should consider looking at other options for this price category. NYC has so much to offer in the luxury hotel market. The location makes this Ritz a great selection, if you do not mind passing on more updated design and modern room features.

In short, the hotel and the ladies and gentlemen who make it what it is - are absolutely spectacular. There was only one issue with the Club Lounge which I will get into later. Despite this issue, I have given the hotel the highest rating as I believe the Club Lounge almost operates under different rules and culture.This Ritz is THE quintessential luxury hotel in the most perfect location imaginable with its entry right across from the south entrance to Central Park. It is a 1 minute walk to the most luxurious shopping imaginable, and its prime location puts it in the culinary heart of NYC as well. Let's break the experience down into some categories because this hotel deserves that.ServiceThere is no other hotel chain on earth that has better service than Ritz Carlton. I have said it before in other reviews. The front desk staff are second to none anticipating your needs just as the restaurant staff and the concierge staff. In short, they made me feel welcome.RoomThis is also one of the Top 5 rooms I have ever stayed in. When I checked in, I was a bit earlier than check-in time, so they had me go to the Club Lounge. To my surprise, they upgraded me to a Park View Suite which was spectacular! I had a corner suite with full views of Central park, a gorgeous living room which was tastefully decorated, and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.Room ServiceThe food at this hotel as well as the menu are first class. I loved the creative green salad with quinoa and skirt steak I had in the lobby lounge, and I loved the house smoked salmon I ordered in room for breakfast.Club LoungeThe club lounge in this hotel is not like other Ritz-Carlton club lounges I have experienced. This particular one is not friendly at all. During my stay, neither of the two attendants at the front desk greeted me during my stay in the lounge. They were busy when I walked in, but neither even came over to introduce themselves although I was there for over an hour. This stands in stark contrast to the amazing experiences I have had in the club lounges of the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas and Marina del Rey. In short, for this hotel, the club lounge is not worth the money. The club lounge is supposed to be a highly personalized experience which affords the guest a higher level of service. Central Park fell very far short of that.Overall, again, despite the Club Lounge experience, this hotel is 5 star all of the way. While it may be pricey, there is no better placed hotel you can stay in within New York City, and the experience is second to none.","Medford, Oregon","JasonCharlesBourne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medford, Oregon</strong>",67,5.0

We would end up leaving our bags and getting to some wedding related appointments but during that time we received a text that our room was ready. Upon our return we were checked into a very peaceful room on the 9th floor with access to the Club and its numerous presentations. Ender was the sole reason our trip started on the right foot...and it just flowed from there.The room itself was clean, well appointed and very comfortable with a turbo charged AC to compete against the 90+ temps outside. Everyone we came across over the next three nights either remembered our names, knew we were guests and otherwise were genuinely interested in seeing that we wanted for nothing. Let me also remind you that i was here on points...my hoard not so large anymore but so well worth it.Nightly drinks in the lobby, snacks in the club and taking advantage of arguably the most perfect location for a hotel in NYC are certainly just a handful of the numerous highlights this property has to offer. And for those who think this hotel is even remotely stuffy, i beg to differ.

The staff was solicitous. We didn't feel like we were in a big anonymous hotel but rather an intimate luxury inn. We were greeted by name as we came and went. The front desk staff was accomodating to our needs and the concierges were helpful. Quite a professional staff. The gym is functional and while not exciting has everything you need for a workout. The onsite restaurant Auden, was great for breakfast (it was included for us during our stay--but it is very expensive). The staff there was exceptional. See my review on that. We didn't do club level. Also, if you have to feel anyone who missed breakfast by sleeping in, there is a good sandwich shop around the corner south on Sixth Avenue for a quick bacon, egg, cheese sandwich. The location of this hotel is central and convenient. While the rooms are clean and beautiful they do need some freshening and an electrical outlet bar for iphones and other devices would be an nice updated feature. The carpet needs to be replaced. For an NYC hotel room there is ample space both in the room and bathroom. Water pressure good, separate WC, ample toiletries and hairdryer at the ready. A/C was very effective so getting into that incredible bed while the room is cold in the middle of the summer was delicious.We didn't stay in a park view room so we never really looked out the window. For us being price motivated we were fine with that. The room itself was beautiful so we didn't care. All the rooms are furnished the same so the quality is consistent minus the view.

This time they did manage to get us a table at Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar, which is not easy. This particular property has been high on my list as it is located next to the Central Park and views from the Park View rooms are simply amazing. Otherwise, this location has started to deliver mixed service standards mainly in Food & Beverage Area.I always stay at the club level and I found that the service level had really dropped drastically since my last visit few years ago. The presentations during cocktail hours were very poor from variety perspective and the breakfast was kind of disappointing as well. Lunch and Afternoon tea service was pretty nice. We also tried the room service once and the food was less then innovative. In the lounge, the staff was not very proactive for example they did not ask during the breakfast if we would like to have cappuccino and during the cocktail hours guest had to go to the kitchen to ask if they could have a drink as the staff was not managing the tables. Generally, only the person at the concierge desk said something to us. Others did seem pretty much tuned out.Usually, the Ritz have had employees at the main doors in uniforms to greet guests, when they leave and return to the property. This time they did not have them there. Few times some employees without uniform were opening the doors, and I was not really sure if they worked there or not.Few times we sat down in the lobby bar and there were people working behind the bar, but nobody came over to us to ask if we wanted to have a drink or something. It pretty much seemed that they did not have proper amount of staff in duty during the evenings.Overall, it looks like attention to detail mainly at the Club Lounges is something that some Ritz Carlton hotels, like this one, have started to fall behind and sometimes for this reason the better choice from price-to-service ratio perspective could be to stay in other Marriott brand hotels like the Edition or JW Marriott (or maybe even ""outside the family"" in the Peninsula or the Four Seasons). I may not return to this property after our experience.","Helsinki, Finland","TomSjoberg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",116,3.0

We arrived early and thought that we could enjoy a drink in the bar but we were shown to our table straight away. The seating area was dark and gloomy and lacked ambience. For most of the afternoon there was no one else in the lounge and we were the only ones it seemed booked in for afternoon tea. We were each served a small teaplate of approx 5 buns with fillings after which we were given a warm scone and finally a small selection of cake which was served on a very plain silver platter. There was nothing special about the food or presentation at all and cannot be compared in any way shape or form to the fabulous and opulent experience at the ritz London. The one saving grace were the waiters who were very pleasant. We did share our concerns with the duty manager but left feeling our comments would make very little difference. Such a shame as this very expensive experience was booked by my husband for our anniversary.

But since it was our 20th wedding anniversary this week, my husband, who works in the Caraiben for half a year decided to surprise us! He had emailed the hotel about it before. So they knew, we didn't. We stay a lot in RC hotels around the world and whenever in NY we always stay at Ritz Battery Park. We love the view over the water and still so close to the city! It was always a dream to stay here...My decisison to stay here this time was of the location, close to the park, shops, restaurants etc. Check in was smooth and Adam gave our daughter her Ritz check in.. he spoiled her! He was so nice to talk to! Our room was way in the back, low floor, no view at all....I saw in an earlier review this might have been because we sked for 2 queen beds...Should I have known I would have asked for a King..Being a Marriott Platinum member I expected more...We went to the lounge which had a beautiful view overlooking the entrance of Central Park and the horse carriages. There was a nice food presentation. But somehow, it didn't feel good...We almost had to beg for a drink, after we tipped the men, he was a little more friendly. However, our daughter is very well behaved, very well travelled, she was very quiet, has good manners, some guests looked at us down for being here with a child. Also the staff in he club-lounge were polite but not over friendly. We liked Charles (?) very much! He was great! After our 9 hr flight we decided to sleep. Loud airco so you couldn't hear any noise from the streets behind ;) Same stand-off atmosphere in the lounge the next morning. We had breakfast, overlooking the park with poor people (do not know the english word for them, sorry) on the banks sleeping in front of us. Nice choice of breakfast but like warm egg or waffle or pancake was missing..No-one offered it to us as well... After a walk, we came back to the hotel, our daughter did the horse feeding with a very nice lady from the hotel! It was a great adventure and she was so nice to talk to!!! When my husband talked to the very friendly and very experienced lady conciierge I had a look at the bar-menu on one of the tables and the waiter came to me with an attitude of ""what I was doing there"". We decided to have a cold drink after the hot temperatures outside in their lounge but we were ignored totally by waiting staff...And we tipped the man the day before ?!?! Why, we did not know. Finally, after I went to his kitchen and asked for a cold beer, he served it. It was definitely not his best day. They took all the beautiful paintings from the walls (for renovation or inspection) and you could see how long the paintings had hang there already.must have been for years.....After being ignored again we decided ; ""this was it!!"" From my room I called to the Ritz Battery Park, made reservations there and we checked out. The doorman called a cab for us, he was very friendly at first, my husband came a few minutes later, check out took longer than expected. But my husband expected I had tipped the doorman but I did not have any dollars so nobody tipped him unfortunately, he slammed the door of the taxi behind us and said something not nice.....I am not sure why but we had very much the feeling that we did not fit in the hotels's picture.... for some reason....maybe because we are Europeans?!? Maybe we were just tourists at that time....We travelled all over the world, stayed in the most up-class hotels, but even in the Burj-al Arab in Dubai where we have stayed several times we did not feel this 'snobbish' atmosphere!!I still have to say that communication with the hotel before arrival was great!!! The concierge gave us a nice envelop with tips of excursions I asked for! Great!Not sure if wifi was free, it was for us, being a MRW platinum.We were so happy when we came back at Ritz Battery Park, glad to be home!! See my next review!

We were welcomed as warmly---as always--- by Joe, the Door Gentleman who began there years ago and whom I have come to know and respect greatly. The other greeters and Front Desk Staff were also friendly and helpful. I upgraded by choice for a suite with a Park view and wanted to have a special stay for a special business occasion with a person from Australia. I'd suggested The Ritz. I asked if we could please have a telescope and they said that yes, they'd get one out of another unused room for us. Bags were brought up promptly and we were happy and felt at home as always whenever we stay here. We had a drink in the longs and the server was distracted and hurrying. We wanted to feel relief from the pace, so it was what it was and we left, tipped 20% anyway. Anyone can have a hard day! The room (1514) was dingy, lifeless. The decor was tepid and unwelcoming. No spark, nothing special. We were very disappointed. It was certainly NOT worth an upgrade. Housekeeping was terrific and collected laundry and had it back to us promptly the next morning cheerfully, and we tipped with appreciation. Breakfast: VERY disappointing! We expect more from Ritz than this! Mustard in the Eggs Benedict was too strong, arrived cold--not on the side as ordered. Waffle was not hot. Fresh fruits were lovely. Even the coffee (!) was NOT HOT. I'd called for a NYTimes which did NOT arrive. The bed linens were fresh but turndown service never arrived. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? The telescope---you guessed it: it never arrived, either, and it's the reason we upgraded so that we could watch planets in the night sky along with the moon. I'm a Ritz Club Member. This stay gives me every reason to consider The Four Seasons or The St. Regis next trip. I've stayed here so many times that I cannot count them. Upon departure, employees were observably stressed---too much so. They were working hard, too. The Bellman was doing his best but the man in charge at the front door (not Joe) was barking orders at workers! This was rude and embarrassing for all. We left amid a chaotic front entrance and management was observably poor. What a waste of a suite, here! The Ritz needs some major changes: this was made clear to us.Note to management: Happy employees=happy guests. Get back on your game. I have NEVER written a review for Ritz that has ever been anything but complimentary. Bad stay, bad food, bad feeling when we left.Problems with Internet connection required the maintenance tech to come to the room, and then it only worked until morning. NOT a good stay, Ritz!","Portland, Maine","Janner2323</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Maine</strong>",30,2.0

I travel more then five times a year, and I travel only luxury style ( meaning first class only and stay at only top 5star hotels ) yet still some 5star hotels need more improvement to reach that standard. To us ""Ritz Carlton Central Park South"" deserves a 7star standard in my opinion. We checked in July 11, stayed in room 1205 with a Central Park view ""a big wow""From the moment our limousine arrived to the hotel, the welcoming that they greet you at the entrance door is unbelievable. Then, the check-in was superb, everyone is there for a reason and that is to make you feel so welcomed. I have never in my entirely life experienced such great service. Indeed, I would have to say the Ritz Carlton Central Park South staff are top notch, well trained, nothing is too much for them when it comes to your happiness and making your stay as pleasant as ever.

Our first stay (a few years ago) was very good but not quite perfect (which is totally ok, as perfection is hard to attain!) It is safe to say that our second stay was as close to perfect as it gets. The highlight of our stay: A staff person (whose name I have forgotten, sadly!) was riding the elevator with us on the morning that we checked in. She asked about our plans for the day. We said that we were taking our 11-year old daughter to her first Broadway show -- Wicked. She wished us a great afternoon and we went our separate ways. Hours later we came back from the show and walked into our room. Imagine our surprise when we heard the Wicked soundtrack! It was playing in the CD player. Next to the player was the CD cover and a note from the staff member that she hoped we enjoyed the show and to please keep the CD as a gift on behalf of the Ritz. Incredible! My daughter was over the moon. Magical is really the only word to describe it.That experience just set the tone for our entire stay, and everything else was as wonderful as you would expect from the Ritz. In addition, the location can't be beat.

There were lots of hotels to choose from, but Ritz Carlton was always a favourite given previous reviews, plus my experience of reading about the Ritz Carlton values and ethos in a number of business books I have read.Staff remembered our name and ensured everything was made easy and ran smoothly. Worthy of particular mention is Sumi, one of the concierge staff. She was excellent. Her knowledge, warmth and helpfulness was exceptional. Now here's a really nice touch... Sumi knew we were going to see the Jersey Boys on Broadway and, when we got back, after the show, she had arranged for the Jersey Boys CD to be playing on the Bose player as we entered our room. That's special! It was a gift from them to us. One of the breakfast staff, Cathleen was also very welcoming. After day 1, she remembered our name and room number and always thanked us for choosing to have breakfast at the hotel. She also remembered which table we liked and tried to keep it for us.We had a Park View room, which is a more expensive option. It was certainly worth it for the view over Central Park. The room size is larger, with more closet space. The beds are very comfortable and I slept really well. The windows are double glazed and noise is very minimal. We were on floor 16, which gave a great view into the distance.The Ritz Carlton do their best to anticipate a need you don't even know you have.

This included things like a welcome gift (blanket), kids experiences (Ritz Kids) like feeding the horses at Central Park where she received a printed photo and stuffed horse, etc.The property was in great condition and met every expectation I have of a Ritz Carlton property and luxury accommodations. One touch that we especially appreciated as parents is that every light in the room is dimmable, which meant that my wife and I could have some light available while our daughter was sleeping.Some of the service was unfortunately hit-or-miss. For example, the person who walked us up to our room offered to have our refrigerator emptied. It didn't happen, and we saw him twice more throughout the week and he would ask if it happened and each time he would say that it would be taken care of. It never was over the course of our six-night stay, and we eventually gave up asking. The housekeeping service seemed to miss different things each time they came. I'm not sure if they were trying to rush to not disturb my wife and daughter in the room, but there were a few times where we didn't have any shampoo or body wash and had to ask for it later. Fortunately there was always evening turn down service and we could get any issues resolved then without much trouble. One night we got a phone call at 9pm that woke our daughter up to tell us that maintenance was outside of our room to install a missing second toilet paper bar in the bathroom. We didn't request it (I guess the turndown person did) or even know it was coming, and we would have preferred to have it addressed the next day when our daughter was awake.The highlight of the club lounge for us was the food. Everything presented was amazing; the quality of ingredients, detail, and presentation were excellent. The personal service was also impressive. Since there were a small number of guests and staff they got to know some of my habits like what drink I liked in a to go cup each morning and would just have it ready as I left. The convenience for my wife and daughter who were near the hotel all day was great as well. One thing that was apparently miscommunicated to us when we made the reservation is that the breakfast is primarily cold. Especially for my daughter, but for my wife and me also we like things like eggs, hot meats, potatoes, pancakes, etc. at least occasionally. This is just a personal preference, but the person making the reservation set our expectations that we would get at least some of these and we were looking forward to them. Because of the miscommunication they did try to accommodate us, but it's clearly not what the club serves and so the club probably just isn't right for us, which makes us sad because everything they did have was amazing and much better than comparable items at say the JW executive lounge down the street, which is included with our elite membership (since the club offers much more it's not included). The only other concern I had was that many things other clubs include were not included here, such as a club floor on a high level (there's no club floor here), upgraded bath amenities, private check in/out in the club, and hot breakfast. None of these were promised anywhere for this hotel, but they're available at some other clubs and would have been welcome touches.At the end of the day, we have a trip back in a month and we need to decide where we're staying. Overall we really liked the property for all of the reasons above, but we're not sure that we can justify the cost of the club lounge when we'll also end up paying for some breakfasts from the hotel restaurant or elsewhere. The alternative is something like the JW where the food included in the lounge is more our style but not at all as good.","Barrington, Illinois","awall222</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barrington, Illinois</strong>",11,4.0

The only problem is I should have stuck with the room in the back due to the street noise from our room 614. We did move to a higher floor the next night to room 1510 for some extra money, but it was from the regular room rate of the park view not the regular non view club level room we already had. $ 941 for a AAA non view club room/lounge is pretty steep, even for NYC, but we do like the club level perks, stopping in there throughout the day for food and drinks. Staff in the club lounge were first class and helped us book a dinner cruise and get us moved to a higher floor. If we do go back again, I would get the club lounge room, but skip the view and get a quieter room. Having been to NYC many times this is my first time at this hotel, since we usually stay at another due to it's location for business.

I did not get an upgrade, which is the risk you take. The only issue I have is that the view (2 windows) to a central, roof/exhaust area was simply disgusting. I wish I had known just how bad the view was, so I could have reserved for at least a city view - but it was too late (none available). Word of warning - these rooms are not worth the rate.Pros: Great location, easy access to Central Park and subway. Bed was comfortable, room was clean (great housekeeping service), although there is not a nespresso machine in the room and the club only has coffee for the breakfast service - otherwise you have to ask for a coffee. Good size room (425 sqft) and bathroom was large with separate tub/shower and great amenities (water pressure was ok). Offer afternoon tea in the club and it was lovely - great English scones with clotted cream. The fitness center was clean and had what I needed for my workout. The staff was friendly. No problems with wifi, but I'm not a huge user during vacation.Cons: Club-The food presentations in the club were the same for all three days that we were there. They only have wine, water, soda and tea out for self pour, otherwise you have to ask one of the attendants for any other drink - including a cordial or coffee after dinner. Worst Ritz Club candy cart-ever. We had to haul our luggage through the two entry doors, which are heavy glass - no bellman in site. No pool and one steam room in the spa. The relaxation room is immediately outside of the treatment rooms, so it could be a little awkward going in/out - or possibly noisy if a couple chatty ladies are waiting. Our dinner at Auden Bistro was meh- the sushi flatbread was good, but the monkfish was a bit tough and really tasteless.I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing that they are preparing for a renovation in the very near future. You get the feeling that they are just trying to get by with what they have and will not go out of their way to improve what is currently available. They may be a little under-staffed.If you desire to have a luxury stay near Central Park, I would have to recommend Mandarin Oriental at this time, even though I'm a RC fan.

As a member of the Ritz club the complimentary wifi is nice and always ask for a view if possible for the inside room are darker and look out at the side of a gray dirty building .....

It would be easy to write off the high level of service we received by simply stating: ""It's the Ritz, what do you expect?"" but it was so much more than that.Pre-trip we were very familiar with the location having stayed before at the New York Athletic Club down the street. I don't think you can beat midtown for a tourist weekend...especially being on the park. You have lots of close-in subway options for both the East and West side as well as the NR down Broadway. It's also easy to get a taxi or uber being in such a dense 5 star hotel area.We arrived early in the day after a long flight and were overjoyed they had a room available. We had told them while making the reservation we were celebrating a weekend away without the kids and they upgraded us to a room on the park. Even though just on the 5th floor it had a beautiful view and was QUIET. I don't know what is in those walls and windows but we literally could not hear a thing from the street which is rare in NYC.The room felt large, huge by NYC standards. It has an enormous marble bath with separate soaking tub and a separate WC. Wow. Great water pressure and amenities. The bed was top notch...great mattress, smoothly pressed sheets and pillow slips.There was a nice personalized note of welcome for us with juice and pastries! Later we would find a very nice bottle of champagne as well as plush toys to take home for the kids. The absolute topper was our bed covered in rose petals on our last night which blew both of us away.Aside from the over the top in room spoiling the few requests we made to the front desk, housekeeping, and concierge were carried out perfectly and with a smile. The complimentary coffee service in the morning was nice to enjoy after our morning runs as well. Somehow the doorman knew us by name was very helpful when waiting for an uber. On our departure day Central Park South was closed as was 6th Ave for a bike race. We already had an uber en route to pick us up upon checkout. The front desk was quick to explain the situation and recommend where we should meet our car. That was a huge help.Although we were outside of the hotel most of the time, whenever we were back it felt like our luxury home away from home with lots of very friendly staff to ensure we had everything we needed and then some.

Is it because I wasn't in a corner suite this time (which would make this far too personal) or is it indicative of a broader resting on its laurels (probably).My title and surname were used correctly about three times across four days and used incorrectly a couple of dozen times. Poached eggs for one breakfast were set hard by the time they reached my room; breakfast on the following morning delivered an eggs benedict that was almost cold. I had booked a high floor looking over Central Park only to find on arriving that I had been allocated the very first level of these 10 upper floors despite, when I asked, discovering an identical room available several floors higher. Any upgrades, even to the executive lounge? - ""no, Sir, we're very busy"" - to which I replied ""yes, I'm one of the many reasons you're busy"". I was surprised given my stay history and my silver loyalty scheme status.These are indeed generally small irritants but they do add up to diminish the customer experience. Overall, it spoke to me of a lack of attention to detail and a certain resting on its laurels.

Great location on South Central Park. Generous sized room and bathroom but no view. I paid using Marriott points and cash and had selected the lowest tiered room.Used the spa which was nice.The gym was very small and doesn't seem like it was custom-designed, more that it was the only available space to put the gym equipment. It is an L-shaped room and not very wide so not a lot of space. Had afternoon tea there also and was disappointed in the service. Whilst the food was good, they kept the tea pots off the table as they want to pour it themselves. That's fair enough but they really ought to be faster. I was finishing courses with an empty cup sitting in front of me. First world problems I know, but the service just wasn't right. My other complaint also involves tea! There was no teamaking facility in the room (there was for coffee) and so I asked for boiling water and a tea bag. They brought it alright, but it was accompanied with a $12 charge! That one really annoyed me. $12 for boiling water and a teabag just isn't right, especially when you consider what the hotel costs.Staff overall were great. Door staff were especially helpful and courteous. Pre-Christmas, there was warm apple cider and cookies in the reception which were a great way to warm up when returning to the hotel.It's a classic hotel, and I would stay here again despite the minor flaws I have pointed out.",Ireland,"the_outcast</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ireland</strong>",23,4.0

It is centrally located, with access to the best shopping, restaurants and of course, Central Park. The staff is always very accommodating, and service is top-notch. The rooms are not huge, but they are luxuriously appointed, immaculate and comfortable. The Ritz Carlton beds are some of the most comfortable beds out there, even better than the Westin Heavenly Bed. I usually don't like wall to wall carpet in a hotel because they tend to be dirty and have visible stains, or are very worn, but the carpet in the RC rooms are light and clean. I am a stickler on bathrooms, and they are always clean and have a lot of counter space for make-up and toiletries. The bar is upscale and serves a good selection of wine and cocktails. They close fairly early, as do all the other bars around that area so if you're looking for a late-night drink, you might have a hard time finding it.","Atlanta, Georgia","BizTravelerfromATL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",19,5.0

The room was large, beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. We were upgraded to a view of Central Park, which was nice. The bathroom was very nice as it had separate tub and shower and products I would use other than at a hotel. There was only 1 sink in our room, but the vanity was large enough for 2 and there was storage for my toiletries, which is always appreciated. Admittedly, I am a bathroom snob and this one I liked. The super comfy bed with luxury linens was hard to leave in the morning. This property is unusually quiet. We never heard hallway noise, not even the slamming doors you usually get in hotels. If you hear anything from the street, your window is open. Yes, that happened to us and you can hear traffic 10 stories up.Of course, the excellent service is what sets the Ritz apart. We came back from a theatre performance to find the soundtrack and a nice note from the guest services gentleman that had greeted us on day one. How he remembered we were seeing that show on that evening is beyond me. As we checked out, the desk clerk asked me how I liked a different show we had seen. Mind you, we bought the tickets ourselves, not through the hotel. The concierge delivered spot on recommendations for lunch and dinner and gave helpful hints on getting around during the cold and snow. Everyone called us by name, making us feel as though we were the only people in the hotel. The proximity to Central Park (across the street), shopping, theatre and restaurants makes this one of our favorite places to stay in NYC.There is a small, but very nice spa at the hotel. I enjoyed an excellent deep tissue massage that worked out the kinks from flying.","Houston, Texas","lizd988</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",39,5.0

I answered ""It was the best night of my life!""It wasn't just because the hotel and staff were amazing, I proposed to my girlfriend of 6 years in the room that night. The staff of this property went above and beyond for one of the most special moments of our life. After hours of research trying to find the right place to stay the night of my proposal. I decided on the Ritz Carlton Central Park because of their reputation and the famous surrounding landmarks we love. My original plan was to propose somewhere outside but as the day approached, weather was not going to comply with my plans.I contacted the concierge to explain my dilemma, this was the beginning of how much the Ritz Carlton showed me they appreciate their guests. My revised plan was to propose to her in the room as we walked in. I asked him if they could make a path of roses petals from the door leading to a rose petal heart on the bed. It was something I saw online when researching the property from a previous guest. He promptly said yes and was extremely kind and helpful.The night of we pulled up to the hotel where I was quickly greeted at my car for valet parking. Within in seconds I was checking in. The front desk associate was so friendly and upon hearing my name began smiling even more than before...no doubt because she knew of my plans which made me happy. My original reservation was for an interior king guest room but to my surprise she explained we were upgraded to a Central Park View Suite. At that moment I was blown away. As we opened the door, my girlfriend walked in first and noticed the path of rose petals. Immediately she knew something was happening and began to cry. I took her hand walked to the middle of this beautiful suite over looking central park and went to one knee and proposed...she said yes!The warm and over the top customer service continued from our in room dining waiter to the lobby staff and front desk at check out, all of them congratulated us and knew of the proposal. It was a magical night that we will never forget, without the Ritz Carlton and their excellent staff it would not of been possible.","Southampton, New York","Daniel T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, New York</strong>",4,5.0

This is a great location and we were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking Central Park. The location is convenient to shops, restaurants and theaters. Front desk staff are courteous and accomodating as well as the bell and doormen and the rooms are beautufully appointed and spotlessly clean. The Club Lounge was very disappointing, though, from the standpoint of service and amenities. I have been to RC club lounges all over the world so in comparison this one rates at the very bottom. First, the staff seem more inclined to converse with each other than anticipate and serve the customer. For example, they were very slow to clean up tables, replace food items, or bring requested items (that are not out of the ordinary such as expresso, gluten free bread, plain yogurt). No anticipation of the guest's needs-just a total sense of uncaring and complacency. In fact, on my third morning for breakfast, i asked for these items for the third time and was greeted with a reluctant acknowledgement plus I overheard the concierge make a snide remark to the servers. As a female executive traveling often, I have never encountered this in an RC club lounge previously. My gluten free bread arrived with one heal of the bread loaf, quite shameful in a 5 star hotel. Overall, in spite of the lovely location and beautiful rooms, this experience does not compel me to return nor recommend to my business colleagues. There are plenty of other excellent hotels in NYC who will appreciate your business.","Raleigh, North Carolina","joy1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",115,3.0

Location - perfect. View - perfect (in my opinion, the extra bucks are worth the bird's eye view of Central Park and the fun going on at street level on Central Park South - particularly if it snows ever so lightly, almost on cue). High Tea - perfect. Bedding - oh, so perfect. Staff, none better. So why only a ""very good"" rating? Well, I found myself in need of help with my hair, and they don't have a hair salon (first time this ever happened to me, so I just assumed they had a salon, but no). Also, I had wanted to spend the better part of one day at their spa, but it's really not that kind of spa - they offer great treatments, no complaint there, but the space is what older hotels have to do in order to have a spa in the first place - they're small and crowded, and no ""water works,"" like a pool or hot tub, or even a quiet room with a view. So it's slightly disappointing and not the relaxing treat I had anticipated. I don't like going elsewhere for a spa, I like having it on site. And NYC isn't the place to go traipsing around for a spa anyway. So I love this hotel and we've stayed there many times and will continue, but I won't be looking for a hair salon or an elaborate spa the next time.","Asheville, North Carolina","lynl2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Asheville, North Carolina</strong>",33,4.0

The location, right at 6th and Central Park South, is hard to beat as it is central to everything and within walking distance to so many different NYC sights/options/etc. First, allow me to comment on the wonderful.The people. The personnel are beyond fab. From the front desk folks (especially Jenny) to the club level concierge team (Felix and Lazare were on it along with EVERYONE else there) to the housekeeping staff, everyone gave us 110%. The lobby lounge had the only staff who were not 110% - and they still were at a solid 95% haha so seriously....great teams, excellent service. Next, the not so wonderful.The rooms are starting to show some wear and tear. And when your most basic room is at 700 bucks per night, well, let's get on this, shall we?? Also, the room service was consistently sub par. And beyond that? Room service pricing was beyond absurd. NYC food is going to cost you. But this was well beyond anything I have seen. My son would order 2 scrambled eggs. He is 6. He would order them in the club room and RS would deliver. It was 50 dollars each time so after a few days of this, when we realized the ridiculous cost for cold and mushy eggs, yes....we put an end to that. The menu is limited, chicken noodle soup is beyond flavorless (seriously - how is that even possible? Campbells chicken and stars tastes better!!) and we gave up after a few days. The same applies to the high end restaurant downstairs. Food was so so and way overpriced for quality. We had Christmas day dinner and the service was slow, order done wrong (a couple of times), and it was not conducive to a classic top notch Ritz experience. Go to Sarabeths or Villagio or around the corner to Angela's for great sandwiches and crispy fries. If I am going to pay 20 bucks for fries they better rock my world. And that did not happen. ;)While I still love the location, and I personally feel the service can not be beat (especially club level), I would suggest the St Regis, Peninsula, Palace, or Plaza for location and food until the Ritz can get back to a solid 5 star rating.",Florida,"FloridaPeapod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",120,4.0

We checked in Saturday, November 8 through Wednesday, November 12. We booked through American Express Platinum Travel. We arrived at La Guardia airport and took a taxi to the hotel. The rates to be picked up in a private car via the hotel were very expensive - $260 and up, so we decided to take a taxi from the airport, about $60. There was a lot of traffic. The ride was about 40 minutes. As soon as we arrived to the hotel, the bellmen took our strollers and bags right away and we headed to check in. While I was there, a gentleman came out with a wagon full of toys so that our 2 kids could pick out from. That was very nice. I love how the Ritz always puts a smile on my kids and us too :) We then headed to our room. We had requested a park view and did get it. The view was perfect! We were on the 8th floor. Enough to see the horse carriages down below and also the park as well as the buildings near us. Our room was the perfect size. It was clean and we were very content overall. Although it's loud outside with all the traffic and the echoing of sirens when they went by, it was pretty quiet overall. We had breakfast in the restaurant. The cinnamon buttermilk pancakes were so GOOD! Everything we ate was delicious. When we called down for room service or anything we needed, it was delivered quickly. The doormen and other workers called my kids by their first names. Hands down the best customer service. This hotel is located across the street from central park.

I was extended many apologies and given the group rate for the second night before I moved but did not expect this at the Ritz, particularly since I reside in one of their properties and belong to the ""owners club'.I booked the remainder of my stay at the Pierre around the corner.

The double pane windows kept out the noise because we didn't hear any traffic sounds. The beds were very comfortable The Club Level offered continuous food offerings throughout the day. The menu changed throughout the day depending on whether you were there for breakfast, lunch, tea, cocktails or after dinner drinks. The food was nicely presented and quite good. It was a peaceful retreat for us to enjoy a glass of wine, cup of tea, canapés and complimentary WI-FI when we needed to take a break from NY noise. The bar is fairly plain, but the surrounding area is quite nice relax with a cocktail . If you are looking for a European feeling and traditional service I would recommend the Ritz Carlton Central Park South.","San Francisco, California","Traveltattle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",13,5.0

From the moment we pulled up to Valet the car, the service was simply excellent. Beyond anything my wife and I had experienced (even at Four Seasons). Our valet was named Felix, and he was outstanding, from letting us know about a 100,000 person protest scheduled the next morning, to directions on anywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan. Felix helped us with our bags (and must have radioed to the doormen (holding the door) as they both greeted us by name (literally 2 mins after we pulled up to the curb).Orlando was at the front desk when we arrived - he knew it was our 5 yr anniversary (I had called ahead) so he gave us complimentary club lounge access (beautiful room overlooking Central Park, with complimentary soda, water, wine, champagne, and light sandwiches and snacks, coffee/tea!!). Ronald came to fetch us from heaven (AKA the club lounge) and escorted us to our room where they had (unknowingly to either of us) spread out white rose petals all over the room and bed. My wife was amazed. They also had a bottle of champagne and choc. covered strawberries waiting for us. Shortly thereafter, Jose arrived with our bags and proceeded to arrange a courtesy car for that evening to take us to the FlatIron district for our dinner reservation. The hotel itself is just AWESOME. Lobby and lounge are great, the bar is very ornate. I didn't get a chance to visit the spa - but it looked inviting.

She was beyond gracious and was most helpful. She made dinner reservations and arranged for cars for us as well. All her restaurant recommendations were wonderful. The lobby, reception area, the dining rooms and our room were all beautiful. On the evening of our anniversary, we mentioned to her that we were attending the Broadway production of Cinderella. When we returned to our room, the music from the show was playiing on the CD player. A member of the customer support staff had purchased the CD of the soundtrack from the play. He left a note saying that the hotel staff hoped we had enjoyed our stay and that the CD was ours to remember our visit. This was one of the most considerate and thoughtful gestures I can ever remember experiencing in my life. It topped off our most wonderful trip.

Still, it's great to just walk across the street into the park, and it's convenient to be close to the Time Warner Center, which is a great upscale mall (has a delicious Bouchon Bakery by Thomas Keller for breakfast) and also has an enormous subway station. I liked the lobby a lot, very luxurious and comfortable, and big enough so that it was never over-run. There is free coffee in the morning, iced tea and treats later in the day, that was a great touch. I saved up a year of business travel points to redeem 3 nights here, and got Gold status in the process. Supposedly I should get a room upgrade for my troubles but there was no way to tell, got a small room facing the back (not exactly an elevator shaft but from the 4th floor room there was really no direct sun in the room ever). The room is nice enough but the furniture is getting worn and the bath fittings are fine but no question outdated. This is in distinct contrast to the St Regis in Aspen where we just stayed, everything is top of the line and it does feel more luxurious. Aren't you expecting the best when you stay at a property like this?Had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, service was great, food was ok. Coffee is good. had room service for dinner, again the food was average but not outrageously expensive at least.The staff is phenomenally trained, everyone was professional and incredibly helpful. That was very impressive.The last night I knocked a glass of red wine over onto the carpet and this was handled in impeccable fashion. Of course it was just so embarrassing but within 2-3 minutes someone from housekeeping was at the door with a steam cleaner and had it all handled in 5 minutes, looked like it had never happened. I was very impressed and they told me not to worry about it and really seemed to mean it, I was very appreciative.One final note: I did like that there were absolutely no charges for the room when redeeming points- no resort fee, taxes, nothing!

But let me tell you, after the RC of DC, i am not sure that this RC is at bar. We were a group that checked in 23 rooms at the same time. Of course you expect best treatment! but they put me in a lower floor with dimmed lights. Called the reception manager, George, who was nothing but unhelpful if not rude! he lied about availability of other rooms and spoke with condescending tone and language that made me hit the roof. So I requested to speak to the manager who was much better person and managed to relocate me to a nicer room at higher floor. I told them that this person should not talking to client.

And the overall customer experience you get in return is just not up to par. The rooms are nice, but small and in need for remodelling. As are the hallways and some of the public spaces. Furthermore we would have expected more qualified staff as well. At slightly lower rates we would have given the Ritz a score of 4. But, again, good hotel in a great location.

Andrea checked us in quickly, offering us bottles of Ritz-Carlton bottled water while we waited, but informed us that our room (which was upgraded to a suite overlooking Central Park) was not quite yet ready. While we were perfectly happy to wait for a bit while the room was prepared, Andrea offered us complimentary access to the hotel's Club Level, which featured four types of wine, several types of light food offerings (which appeared to change every 30 to 45 minutes, which was quite nice), and a very knowledgeable dedicated concierge named Felix who really knew about NYC. Although we already had several restaurants and other activities booked, Felix told us about various food trucks, coffee shops and stores that we simply would not know about without his advice. After about 20 minutes, Andrea came to the Club Level to tell us that our room was ready, so off we went.I have stayed in hotel rooms in several cities around the world for business and pleasure, but none to date have made such a positive first impression upon entering. It could have been the size of the room (which is quite large for NYC), the fact that we had ""his and hers"" closets, the lovely welcome chocolates and letter, or the bathroom that contained everything that you would need or want in a bathroom (separate toilet closet, independent shower and bathtub, large mirror and counter space, surround sound speakers that are connected to the television in the main part of the room, among other things), but we were very impressed.If there is one flaw with this hotel, it is the same one that affects all of the 5-star properties directly adjacent to Central Park - that is, all four streets immediately around Central Park (8th Avenue, 5th Avenue, West 59th Street, West 110th Street) naturally have a lot of traffic on them, but none more so than 59th Street West. This street noise is somewhat audible from the sixth floor, however, the reason that I do not subtract a star from this review (aside from the rest of the hotel being so amazing that it still deserves five stars) is because the audio dock next to each bed offers different musical and ambient noise settings which, when combined with the good speakers in the room, more than drown out any noise that you might hear from the street. The Ritz-Carlton Central Park really has thought of everything, and I can only give it my highest recommendation.","Ottawa, Ontario","Ippocalyptica</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Ontario</strong>",134,5.0

The concierge was equally accommodating in planning our trips out.

We were traveling with our children ages 7 and 8 and from the moment we arrived the hotel staff made us feel like we had stated there 100 times. Service was amazing and while I could note multiple examples, one moment sticks out in my mind. I went downstairs to the front desk one am and mentioned that I needed some cold medicine for my wife. After a full day in the city we arrived back at the hotel. 10 minutes after we arrived back into our suite the staff delivered chicken soup with a handwritten note for my wife telling her that she hoped she felt better. Beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms, awesome club level amazing staff. We are from savannah, ga (voted the second friendliest city in the country) so we know a thing or two about it!

With the hotel being quite full, I did not receive my typical upgrade. But, the front desk attendant, Denise was extremely helpful in finding us the best possible option for the room type that I booked. We enjoyed well made cocktails in the lounge, while waiting for our room to be inspected. The prices are what you would expect for NYC and the Ritz Carlton. Denise personally showed us to our room and offered to bring anything else that we needed. We elected to have complimentary coffee service for the morning (no coffee maker in room, unless requested) and it was delivered shortly thereafter. The room is large, by NYC standards and extremely well appointed. I was particularly pleased with the very spacious bathroom. The bed and pillows were absolutely heavenly. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Overlooking Central Park and within walking distance to several areas of Manhattan. The concierge helped us with last minute dinner reservations and we ended up at Porter House. The meal was very nice and the service was impeccable. But, the restaurant lacks ambiance for the price that you pay. Had I realized that it was inside the mall, I would have made a different choice. The morning of our departure, we didn't have much time for walking and waiting in line somewhere. So, we enjoyed the coffee service in room and headed down to Auden for breakfast. Service was fantastic from the moment we were greeted till the moment we payed the bill. The meal (once again priced like a Ritz Carlton in NYC) was wonderful. We split an omelet and the pancakes and loved both.There may very well be less expensive options that provide a better ""bang for the buck"" experience.

This room was tiny and featured elevator noise. We have stayed at a number of Ritz's recently, usually club access. There are no vintage wines, and the usual appetizers. They couldn't come up with my beer of choice and made no efforts to acquire. Housekeeping is exceptional. The rear bumper of our Acura 2014 MDX had damage, dented in, which we noticed on checkout. This car was loaded by me at home, driven directly to the hotel and I unloaded the bags at the hotel. This car has 6000 miles and I unload my own suitcases to avoid problems.The Doorman instantly produced a damage report. We denied that our car arrived damaged. We were told this report was filled out on our arrival, although we were not copied. We learned our car was picked up by an outside garage employee, who fills out a report, a service that the Ritz farms out. Your car is not on site and will not be available for in and out service. We have since learned that this report does not get completed if it is really busy. That means it can be filled out anytime while the car is out of your possession. I don't drive or have cars with dents. If I had that misfortune the car would be in the shop getting repaired, not driven. I have other cars at my disposal, so why would I chose a dented car to drive to New York. The lesson learned, take photos of your car at checkin. Smarter yet, google parking garages in the area and park your own car. What is the Ritz/ Marriott position? They have a damage report and I Arrived with a damaged car. ""I should contact the garage"". ""Maybe the garage might compensate me"". This would be their contracted garage, who I neither had any knowledge of our contact with. I Paid Ritz for Valet parking.

The location is superb, the staff are welcoming and extremely helpful - especially Al at the door and Maria the concierge, the beds are super comfy and the decor is very grand. As a young couple we wanted to be in a good location where we could experience the whole atmosphere of the City that never sleeps, the Ritz Carlton is situated in a perfect place right by the park with breathtaking views, not too far of a walk from all the shopping locations and a short cab ride from most of the main 'attractions' as a tourist. There is an amazing restaurant which has opened next door called 'villagio' I would defiantly recommend a visit there and so would the doormen!!... Nothing seemed like too much of an effort for any of the staff they was all very attentive. The only one thing I would say is on our last day we had a late night flight, so we was asked to leave our room for 11am and had to wait around until 6pm to be picked up, they was happy to look after our suitcases but other than that there was no late checkout option etc. ",,Hannah-Louise S,1,5.0

From the golden elevator doors to the large rooms (of course relative to other New York City hotels) to the beautiful lobby with immaculately-shined marble floors, everything oozes luxury and class. The location is ideal, right across from Central Park and pretty close to most things - easy enough to access Subway right around corner, centrally located if you're taking a cab. The room was large, with an almost-wasteful entryway, a wonderful bed, a chair (but no footrest), and a gorgeously large and opulent bathroom. In terms of physical facilities, the hotel and rooms are beyond reproach.Unfortunately, along with that comes quite a bit of stuffiness and pretension. If you’re a younger traveler, or don’t enjoy dressing in couture, you might get strange/unfriendly looks from other guests and even some staff. Both happened to me more than once during a one-night stay. Further, service seems to be relative to expected wealth; my requests of the concierge were sometimes honored, and sometimes more or less blown off (I asked where I could find bath bubbles for the bathtub and was directed to the salts already in the room, which, I know, is totally minor, but nevertheless not service going ""above and beyond"" in any way). The exception was the bartender, who was very friendly, but the wait staff in the lounge area were not very knowledgeable about their drinks, and, again, seemed to attend to certain clients more than others. Wi-fi was not free, which is shameful in 2014, but did work as advertised. There was somebody (security? butler?) walking around my floor occasionally who never introduced himself and made me feel less rather than more comfortable, but that could have been due to a specific guest I imagine.If money is no object, go for it. You certainly won't be disappointed in anything about this hotel. But if you're somebody of average means looking for a special occasion, as I was, you might find yourself better served somewhere more welcoming.","Racine, Wisconsin","Charles S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Racine, Wisconsin</strong>",43,5.0

The complimentary congratulatory gestures from the guest services team, including a giant bowl of chocolate-covered strawberries and a nice card, were very nice touches. NOTE: This is not a place for you to come and complain because its offerings are ""overpriced,"" or ""dated."" Yes. The restaurant is pricey, even for coffee and water. If old-fashioned door handles are a bother, or you need a large lobby and the most modern furnishings, then this may not be to your liking. If you want something ""just as good for less money..,"" then consider going elsewhere. But if you want to treat yourself, or be pampered just because you can, and absorb a little history in the process, this is a nice option. The price for accommodations seems comparable to that of other luxury hotels.Considering what I read of some of the other reviews, I'd be interest to know when the last renovation was completed on this property.

We had no problem walking everywhere even in the pouring rain! We walked the entire stay in New York and the Ritz is convenient to everything. The rooms are impeccable. Very clean and very spacious. I cannot say enough about service. The doormen are helpful and very very friendly. The font desk staff very very courteous. Call for extra towels and within minutes your needs are taken care of.

Upon entering the hotel, everyone made us feel welcome and they were attentive without being obtrusive. The rooms are spacious (by NYC standards they are huge) and meticulously appointed. We booked the Club Level (well worth the extra $) and upon returning from afternoon tea, we were greeted with a beautiful display of chocolate covered strawberries that read ""Happy 2nd Anniversary"" left with a card, in our room.

The hotel has a lot going for it but lacks the finesse to be truly rated 5 star and to be given a review higher than 3.5/5 on TA. ProsThe rooms are lovely - large and well appointed with a good size bathroom. The rooms were quiet with no street noise at all. Concierge were helpful and the doorman friendly. Coffee was served in the lobby each morning which was not charged for which was a nice touch. The bar was cosy and pleasant with attentive servers. ConsThe shower in our bathroom took 10 minutes to produce hot water. This was reported to the hotel who looked at it when we out. They assured us it was fixed. Took a shower the next morning and it took 10 minutes to run warm. Not fixed. I reported it again on check out. I was disappointed that on having emailed the hotel prior to our arrival that it was a very special birthday for my friend during our stay that this was not acknowledged in any was by the hotel. A small gesture would have been appreciated and frankly expected from a 5 star hotel. Turndown service was hit and miss. We only received bottled water by our bedside on 1 of the 3 nights we stayed.

Bad weather in the Uk meant our flights were cancelled so we arrived a day late. Our travel agent had made all the arrangements for us and the RC was advised. When we arrived the front desk said that they had cancelled our whole booking and were treating us as ""no shows""!!!. They eventually found us a room but it was dreadful. the view was awful - see attached photo and was right next to the elevator and every time it went up and down the room vibrated.the next morning we asked to see the Duty Manager and he listened and said we would be moved to a better room and to leave our things and he would call us at 2pm. The call didn't materialise and we waited until 3.30. We were shown 2 rooms which were miles better with a view of Central Park. This room had issues though and the toilet was broken and kept overfilling to the point one day it spilt out all over the bathroom floor, with effluent everywhere. We had to call on 4 different occasions to ask for the loo to be unblocked and no one seemed to actually fix the problem.We also had issues with one of the staff in the club lounge, called Kelly. I asked her for a decaf coffee one morning and I got an eye roll and a huff. The food presentations were not replenished so if you arrived shortly afterwards there was just scraps for you to eat.. I did mention this and was told it was a busy time of year...there are some good points... If the Management team had not responded positively to our complaints we would have rated this hotel and stay as terrible. The senior staff did try and resolve our issues but added together we had quite a few.Gabrielle in the Club lounge was very professional and efficient and it was a much better place when she was on duty.Lazar is a star, a true New Yorker who looks after his guests very well.The Duty Managers including Samuel did their best. We eventually have been refunded for the first night by the hotel. which was good of them.The location is fantastic... maybe it was the time of year that was a problem, but this is nothing like we are used to with the Ritz Carlton chain of hotels... our stay the last time we were in New York at The Pierre was far superior.","Isle of Man, United Kingdom","Sue B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Isle of Man, United Kingdom</strong>",195,3.0

This Ritz Carlton however, provides luxury and immerses you with the local culture. Like what many neighbors of the Ritz Carlton experience, I felt like I was returning to a luxury residence building. You enter effortlessly past bellman that remember you, and into what feels more like a private foyer rather than a ""lobby."" From there you can be up to your room in no-time given elevators that you rarely have to wait on and our rooms proximity to the elevator - which is what I loved given my 35pound dog traveled with me.The ""Parkview Guestroom"" we had on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and had unforgettable views into the park. Since it was winter, we were able to look right into the park - specifically viewing a sanctuary and large pond. The room was also very well laid out, and even with a rollaway bed it felt spacious.A spa treatment at the onsite LaPrairie Spa was very private and relaxing. Auden Bistro & the Star Lounge feature classic menus with discrete service. Espressos ordered through Room Service arrived quickly and hot. And the complimentary coffee and tea in the bar was appreciated.The Ritz Carlton certainly extends their service and amenities to pets as well. My dog was treated like a prince! He was given several welcome amenities and genuinely recognized by the staff each time he passed through the lobby.The purpose of this stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday with my parents. They recognized the celebration and provided a unique amenity for my mom - a large silver frame with the Ritz Carlton logo! I even really enjoyed the location, with a great espresso bar around the corner, a very casual Italian restaurant recommended by the concierge, and of course the park.Some staff outshines others, there is a faint sound of street noise from the 6th floor, and there's the smell of horses when in front of the property - but none of this takes away from the hotel's well deserving status of being a Forbes 5 Star & AAA 5 Diamond property.

It would be difficult to pick one over the other but the Ritz is special. My wife and I had a beautiful suite overlooking Central Park. The rooms are beautifully appointed with some of the finest furniture that I have ever seen in any hotel room. The Staff is relentless in their pursuit to make you completely satisfied. The Concierge Floor is always an added treat. The food selections were varied, well thought out, and very well prepared. Here's what probably sets this hotel a level above most. As we were being accompanied to our room upon check in, the young man asked us the reason for our trip to New York. We mentioned that we were hear to visit our daughter and that we had tickets for Kinky Boots on Saturday. He said he had heard a lot about the show but hadn't had the opportunity to see it. That was the end of the conversation and he politely showed us our room. When we returned from dinner Saturday night, our turn down service CD player was playing a CD from the show with a note hoping that we enjoyed our day. Sure its expensive but this attention to detail made both of us feel special. After all, isn't that what you are paying for ?

After writing to the hotel in advance, she was thrilled when, on arrival, the reception staff wished her a Happy Birthday, as well as, upon entering our Park View room there was a birthday cake with a personalised hand written note. The Room:We were in Park View Room 908 with spectacular views over Central Park. The room was immaculate with all amenities anyone could wish for. The in room dining experience was a delight with prompt service and delicious food. The Restaurant:Although we felt the breakfast was a little expensive, again the food was lovely with plenty of choice and excellent service. We only ate in the restaurant for dinner once; however, the food was delicious with excellent service from the friendly staff. Location:FANTASTIC location. The hotel is set on Central Park South which is just a short walk/cab ride away from 5th Avenue/Broadway. Opposite the hotel was the Horse and Carriage pick up point which is a must to see Central Park. Either a short walk away, or a cab ride away there is Columbus Circle where there is a variety of shops and restaurants. I can thoroughly recommend taking a trip to A Voce restaurant which was recommended to us by a lady on Concierge. Must do:We crammed as much into our trip as we possibly could. We went ice skating at the Rockefeller Center and in Central Park. If you go early enough in the year, I would recommend the first skate of the day at Rockefeller. We took a trip to the 9/11 memorial and although we had not pre-booked a visitor pass before we went to NY, the concierge team were on hand to book this for us. Our trip to Statue of Liberty was an experience to say the least. We had pre-booked tickets to ‘climb’ to the crown. Very naively we assumed there would be a lift, how wrong we were. Instead we had to climb up the tightest of staircases I have ever been on which are definitely not suitable for those who suffer from claustrophobia or are perhaps a little larger. We had pre booked tickets to go to the top of the Empire State Building. With these Express tickets we were able to skip the long queues and head straight to floor 102. A visit to New York isn’t complete without a trip to Broadway to see a show; we saw Wicked at the Gershwin theatre, it was brilliant!The Staff:The staff made our trip for us; they were so friendly and could not do enough for us. A special thank you to Yoneidy Carreno in Guest Relations for organising the cake as well as the staff on the Concierge desk and on the door who were very so helpful and very friendly. Overall, I cannot fault the Ritz-Carlton at all. With the fantastic staff, location and beautiful hotel this is the perfect place to stay in New York.","London, United Kingdom","holiday_lover_9559</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

If you are looking for a ""deal,"" then you should probably stop reading my review. This is one of the top hotels in NYC, and that fact was apparent very moment of our stay. I am a New York resident and booked a night through AMEX platinum travel to celebrate a special birthday with my wife. When I mentioned this at check-in (I was asked!), we were upgraded two levels to an amazing park view deluxe room, and sent a very nice note and bowl of chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate the occasion. Very nice touch. The facilities and service are top notch. Our room was spacious, well-decorated, and comfortable. The view of Central Park was incredible. The bar is classic and the cocktails are delicious. The service at Auden was fantastic even if breakfast is way overpriced unless it is included in your rate. Spa services are also top notch. My one complaint is that the men's relaxation room is really not much of room, and not that relaxing. Certainly not compared to the female equivalent. Location cannot be beat. You are right on CPS and equidistant between 5th Avenue and the Time Warner Center. You can create a great walking itinerary for yourself in the park, to a restaurant or shopping. All in all, a memorable experience. I'm glad I splurged, I would do it again, and most importantly - my wife loved it.","New York City, New York","NYFFlyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",6,5.0

I stayed here a few years ago during the week of Thanksgiving, and was completely blown away by everything. We stayed in adjoining suites on the 5th floor with corner views of the park. Our room came stocked with everything one needs on vacation, including a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue Label and dried fruits put out daily. It was a completely lavish experience and one I will cherish forever. We dined downstairs for Thanksgiving dinner, which of course was a bit of a disaster since the place was obviously overbooked, however the foods was gourmet and delicious, and the service was a bit slow but kind. There was nothing better than enjoying a glass of Prosecco in the lounge area just inside through the foyer.

Everything I needed was within walking distance, although saying that I've walked from Central Park to Battery and back before!The check-in was very functional, not warm and certainly not welcoming. As a Marriott Platinum Elite member I expected better (and have received much better at other Ritz-Carlton hotels), especially when paying over $1000 per night. Unfortunately, check-out wasn't much better - I wasn't even asked if I had enjoyed my stay! Overall, I did not find the staff at all helpful or friendly, and certainly not up to level of service I have found elsewhere in New York. Reading other reviews, maybe I just experienced the staff on a bad weekend.The room was lovely, looking right down Central Park, well furnished, clean and quiet, although the mattress was too soft for my liking - one night I actually slept in one of the chairs as I found it more comfortable. However, for over $1000 per night, the room (not a suite) was small, although I was almost certainly paying more because of the view. I don't normally use minibars in hotel rooms, but the Ritz-Carlton branded candies and snacks looked too good not to try and they certainly lived up to expectations.I only had breakfast in the hotel once and didn't think it to be very special and overpriced for what I ordered. The other mornings, I just went out and found a lovely little coffee shop nearby.

Yes, let's admit at the top of this review, staying at a Ritz property costs $$$$. Whether you're booking with points or paying with hard-earned cash, this is a five-star property. Having said that, those Ritz associates have no idea who or what you have. To them (our experience), they treat everyone the same...and that's with lots of special care. Every experience we encountered, from checking in and out, requesting help from the concierge, doors being opened and greeted when coming and going from the hotel, the club lounge servers, the domestic staff, the bellman, etc. All, top notch. We had the pleasure of being at the Ritz during the UN mtgs., which in many cases, meant crazy traffic and more then normal activity at the hotel. We found the excitement of meeting people from many countries, hearing foreign languages and seeing unique dress only added to our NY experience. It's not every day you meet and share an elevator with someone from Kenya. Our room was a deluxe king with a Central Park view. Gorgeous, comfortable, inviting and a welcome sight every night when we climbed into comfort and luxury. Upon entering our room the first day, the radio was on and tuned into a great station. That was a welcome touch that we continued throughout our five-day stay. On another note, we opted to enjoy the club lounge for breakfast, a few lunches, and often cocktails. Yes, it's an added daily expense. Given the cost of NY restaurants and bars, I do believe we saved money by dining in the club lounge. Great service, good food and a wonderful meeting place when traveling with friends or business associates. Note to the Ritz: There were guests who did not honor the ""no cell phone"" request. It would be helpful if the staff enforced the rule for the pleasure of everyone's experience. As you enter and exit the lounge, they have these glass containers filled with at least four different cookies, and the likes of Tootsie Rolls, caramels and other fun ""child like"" assorted candies. Nice touch. Three out of four of our party enjoyed a massage and/or facials at La Praire at the Ritz Carlton Spa, located on the same floor as the club lounge. My experience was excellent. Again, it's more then you would pay at your favorite spa at home, but well worth the extravagance.The location of this Ritz is smack in the middle of great people watching across from Central Park, a hop/skip to two convenient subway stops, and amazing restaurants and shopping.Horse carriages across from the hotel entrance...we did hear that they could be on the way out. Yes, there is a smell, however, we were more concerned about the well-being of the animals. That alone, hopefully, will motivate the city powers to do what's right. The smell never bothered us. We were forewarned. The amazing experience at the Ritz outweighs that small inconvenience. If you get to the Ritz at Central Park So., please say Hi to Felix (at the door) and Kerri, Regena and Brian...the best concierge staff we've ever encountered.",,Tastymenu,17,5.0

It was our first stay at the property. Upon our return, I went back and looked at all of the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, and I’m a bit perplexed. It’s not as if our stay was terrible, but we are frequent guests at Ritz Carlton properties, and we generally stay on the Club Level. In the last twelve months, we have had club level stays at the downtown Atlanta, New Orleans and Amelia Island (twice) properties. Perhaps, many of these reviewers who were so impressed by the Central Park hotel simply haven’t experienced how great other properties are? Frankly, for us, this was the lowest level of service and worst quality of food we have ever encountered at a Ritz Carlton. And for anyone who thinks that perhaps I just don’t understand New York, please note that in addition to being a frequent visitor, I lived in Manhattan for many years. Before getting to the issues we had with the club level, do note that when booking a room, if you don’t request and pay for a view, you may be looking at the backs of buildings or even at an air shaft. I don’t think the hotel is misleading about this, but some of the possible views are pretty terrible, so you may find that it is worth the extra money in the grand scheme of things. Beyond issues of views, the room was a fairly standard Ritz Carlton room. For those who have remarked that the rooms are small, I did not find this to be the case at all. In fact, I found ours to be in line as far as size with other Ritz Carlton properties. The bathroom was nice with a separate soaking tub and shower. Storage options are a bit odd and for some reason, there was no iron. Also, the elevators are tiny and a bit slow. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful. Now with regard to the club lounge, overall, at all just seemed sloppy and nowhere near the standards we have encountered previously. With the exception of one club lounge staff member, no one ever called me by name and no one ever thanked me for being a frequent customer (Marriott Gold Status). One other staff member was super friendly and helpful, but again, she never bothered to learn or use our names. We stayed three nights. This may seem petty, but for us, it is part of the experience that we have come to expect over the years. Concierge members of the club lounge staff (most notably the women) seem to think they are “above it all” and “better than the other staff members”. I have never encountered another club lounge where they sit at their computer constantly. We were lucky to get a hello on entrance or some other greeting on departure. Generally, at other properties, the concierge staff members work to refill drinks and engage the guests just like the rest of the staff. There was there was one such employee who did this (the same one who bothered to learn our names). The others were completely unhelpful and unfriendly. The staff was so disengaged that they did not notice all of the people who were “sneaking” into the lounge. Several families openly spoke of how they had paid for one club level room but used their keys to allow their traveling companions (aka their teen aged children) to use the lounge. Now, I realize that “guests” to the club lounge are possible, for fee, and I was not privy to every discussion, so perhaps these were “paid” guests, but I don’t believe that was the case as the guests openly referred to what a great “deal” they were getting pulling this off. Again, at other properties, the staff is engaged enough to have some clue as to who is supposed to be in the lounge. Food offerings were significantly less generous and not as well prepared compared to other properties. For example, typically, at least, two hot dishes are offered at breakfast. There were none at the Central Park Ritz. Also at breakfast, the smoked salmon (my personal favorite) was poorly sliced, there were no capers and the onions were way too thick. Champagne was not regularly set out in the afternoons. The afternoon crackers were just out of a box rather than the beautiful sesame seed covered options seen elsewhere. No one ever refilled our glasses or asked if we wanted another beverage. On a more subjective level, I was just not impressed, again compared the other club lounges at other properties that I have visited in the last 12 months, the food was not as good and there was less of it. In addition to the quality and quantity issues, food items at the presentations were not labeled. At some presentations, there were no labels at all. At others, there were a few. Typically, again at other properties, a menu is set out for each food presentation each day and separate labels are offered for each tray so that you know what is being offered in general and specifically what you are eating. This was not done leaving us to hunt down staff to ask, for example, if the meat in the noodles was chicken or pork. The food (particularly the fish dishes) started to spoil on the longer presentations. We were visiting on a very hot weekend. The club lounge was quite warm in large part due to the fact that they apparently have no cooling vent in the service area. Accordingly, the door to that space is always open (and the large window fan the staff uses to try to keep comfortable is audible). The primary food presentation station is in the middle of the room, and nothing is done to keep everything at temperature. This may not be a consistent problem, but in any case, several of the fish items got terribly pungent after two plus hours in the warmth of the room. Club Lounge hours and specifically, the hours for the food presentations are not as stated. We witnessed several cases in which the items were set out late and/or picked up early. All printed materials indicate that the lounge is open until 11PM. In other markets, this means that the presentations are continued until that time. Here, this means that the staff starts removing the food at wine at 9:50PM and that the place is set up for breakfast by 11PM. Not only that, one staff member refused to serve us because he had “locked everything up.” This happened to us when we came to the lounge at 10:45 PM. All food and drinks were removed, and the staff member would not retrieve an after dinner drink for us. As a general comment, in my experience, at other properties, the offered items are replenished throughout the service period such that, if one were to arrive 20 minutes before the end of service, all items would still be available. Here, once they ran out, the item was not restocked even an hour or more before the end of that presentation. In all, we were very disappointed with our stay. I suppose that I had assumed (wrongly apparently) that the Tiers into which the hotels are placed were indicative of something other than how many Marriott points are required for a stay. Clearly, being in tier 5 is an indication of nothing other than being in an expensive market. We didn’t hate this, but it could and should have been so much better. As a final note, we had a great rate for this room. I really would have been disappointed if we had paid in excess of $1000 per night as some people did.","Birmingham, Alabama","LydiaClaire</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",53,3.0

Once booking, I received a standard email from the Guest Relations Supervisor, Yoneidy, asking if I wanted to do anything special to personalize the stay. Of course, I chose mimosas upon arrival, etc. We arrived at the hotel, well before the 3pm check-in, so we went to the bar for our mimosas. Yoneidy, actually found us at the bar and introduced herself. I was stunned she was real, even though we had traded a couple of emails back and forth finalizing our stay. I had requested an early check-in, but they weren't able to accommodate. That was fine as we headed to Central Park to people watch and have lunch. Around 3pm we returned and our room was under going final inspection and the front desk would call when it was ready. About 30 mins later we were telling the hotel bartender our story and she was surprised we were still waiting. I thought nothing of it when she left the bar for a moment, and was happily surprised when she returned with our keys in hand and a complimentary glass of champagne. Our room faced Central Park, it was very large with a seating area, beautiful bath and rose petals covering the bed. Classical music was playing in the background and we fell in love. Even though our check in process was a little off, it didn't matter, the staff was amazing, the room was clean, the attention to detail was noticeable and much appreciated. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.

The room is fairly large and well appointed, by NYC standards, and the bathroom is very large with a separate toilet room. The lack of any view was offset by the all-night quite, which was very nice after long days in the loud and congested city. The concierge service was excellent and very attentive. My chief complaint is the lack of common spaces: the lobby and the lounge are small, and our rate did not give us access to the 2nd floor lounge. Great convenient location across from central park.

Ok, so we didn't reserve well in advance, only a few night in advance, but we got 3 crummy rooms looking at walls of other buildings. It felt like a dungeon and we never opened the curtains. We paid over US$600/night per room. Each room had 2 beds and were pretty standard. The bed quality was good and the bathrooms were large in each room. The ceilings felt low in both the rooms and the hallways. I guess that's what you get for staying at an old hotel. Our first room was ok, but the modem was broken and we had to be changed to another room as we can't go without internet. The second room was different set-up and was a smaller room. Unlucky us. The service was fine. Standard 5 star hotel type service. The lounge is good. I think we paid $100-200 per night to use the lounge service.

It is very luxurious and fancy, but really not our style, we had just as nice a stay at a Courtyard the night before and the East Side Marriott last summer. When we checked in they couldn't find our reservation for some time - which was fairly unsettling, and there were several people in the lobby all dressed up looking like they thought they were better than everyone else. Our room was a corner room with a terrible view but very clean and comfortable. The bed was amazingly comfortable, nice tub with very nice products, magazines to read, books to read, CD to listen too, lots of expensive item in the minibar, robes, slippers, no noise at all!.... the room had it all. We didn't expect the maid to come while we were out for the evening but she did and it was so nice to return to a turned down tidy room - like being on a cruise. We didn't take advantage of any of the services/dining so cannot comment on that. It was fun to stay in such a fancy hotel and the room was incredible. For us, we would rather use fewer points or spend less on a less fancy hotel where we felt more welcomed and comfortable in the public spaces, I really don't want to put on a suit to check in when I am on vacation just to fit in!","Florida, New York","mmosher</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida, New York</strong>",67,4.0

We do a tremendous amount of business with the brand, and as such, have accumulated so many points that we don't know what to do with them all. We thought, let's stay at the 70k point a night place, because honestly, I have had romanced views of this property since I was young, the location can't be beat, and you chose a brand location because you expect to get the same service at every location.My daughter was celebrating her first birthday, which in the korean culture, is a big deal. It was a major milestone birthday for me too---the big X0!We called the platinum elite member line and made reservations. The lovely reservation specialist was able to book the room, and even went as far as to contact the hotel for upgrade requests. if you are platinum elite, you are given a complementary upgrade (not a suite or club), and with the Ritz Carlton Black card, you get another complementary upgrade. Typically, because we literally spend 170 nights and a TON of money in catering and events with the properties, and we do not have many opportunities to travel for pleasure, so when we do, we want it done right. At 70,000 points a night (for $1 a point, that is $70,000 a night), we expect typically marvelous Ritz Carlton service.Because of this, we are almost always given a club suite upgrade, and if not a club suite, a suite with club access. We know this is not guaranteed, and based on availability, and at the discretion of the property. Therefore, we called first to see what their load was like and if we could be accommodated.Actually, our platinum elite reservation specialist called on our behalf, and confirmed guaranteed club access, guaranteed room upgrade, and a request (i.e., not guaranteed) upgrade to suite, based on availability. The front desk manager she spoke with suggested we call in the morning to see if suites had sold, and if not, they could accommodate us.So I called at 7:30 after the kids were up, and spoke with Ertis, MOD, who suggested I speak with George, the rooms controller. I explained the situation to George, and he said he could not guarantee the club access, and that the platinum folks made an error. Well, this isn't really my fault, but he suggested I contact them. So on my daughter's birthday, the day of our arrival, I call the hotel, am directed back to the platinum line where they are trying to track down our agent, transferred back to the hotel, then back to customer service. I told George, look, just let us know if you can do it or not---we can come another time. he said no, you should just come up and we will do our best to accommodate you upon your arrival. I said, actually, I would just prefer to know so that we don't show up and get disappointed. We still could not get a straight answer.So I was directed by customer service to corporate, because the notes did reflect some information about club access, although they apparently did not leave clear enough notes. Again, not my issue, right?Then amazing Pam from corporate contacts the hotel to figure out what is going on. She said that they are now saying that no suites or club access are available. She then notes that, actually, they are selling club access and suites and rooms in almost every category. And by the way, we have a regional sales rep who can access their loads, so someone was not being truthful, and this really put me over the edge.It is your property. if you don't want to accommodate an upgrade, then fine---just say so. Don't tell me to go ahead and come and ""we will see what we can do."" I have small kids and it is everything to have club access, and there are plenty of choices in Manhattan. Second, don't LIE to me. manager Brian finally took the line, and said, well, there myst have been cancellations. Fine. still unlikely, and now they want to charge us $100 for club access after all of this. Fine. We were offered a high park view or a low, city view suite.When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically by the professional doormen, and walked into the unimpressive lobby, greeted genuinely and kindly by the front desk staff, who bestowed small, stuffed horses upon each of my kids, which made them both very happy. Interesting to note, Manager Brian was standing right at the desk and never made eye contact or greeted us. Awkward.We had arrived early, and our room was not available, which was fine. We were told that no suites were available (another change in Brian's story), but a park view room would be ready in an hour or so. Fine.We had a quick snack in the club and headed out shopping. When our room was ready, we walked into a closet of 812, which was a park view, but not a high floor, so we had the view of the street and a bunch of sidewalks and a row of trees, replete with the sounds of traffic---hazards of staying on lower floors.Not only did Brian fail to deliver on either of his promises, the room was tiny. We rearranged the furniture and our daughter slept in a crib in the bathroom, and our son on a roll away in the center of the room. It was almost comical. Except that it was slightly humiliating. The TV was broken, the phone was broken and one of the lamps was broken. Turn down skipped us somehow the first night, and all calls for requests went unanswered.Honestly, we just felt swindled. Look, I can appreciate that people are running a business. I would also appreciate that those businesses recognize that they rely on their dedicated customers to keep things moving. I would rather you be honest with me, so I can make alternate arrangements, than continually encouraging me to come, only to fail to meet any of the promises you've made to us.As far as the club, it was mediocre as far as most RC clubs go. The food was on target, but not spectacular. The service was uneven and unpredictable. You had servers working so hard, and other standing around or playing games on the computer. We had been in the club 5-6 times before the only club concierge, a lovely woman, who happened to be pregnant, carried over a high chair for our 12 month old. Why not one had thought to offer this before is beyond me, but what a lovely thought from this concierge. Coffee was hard to come by, and we had to ask for straws for the kids each time. part of the brand standard is to anticipate the needs of the guests, and since we were down there a few times a day, we still had to chase people down for a cup of coffee, milk for the kids, and a straw.Maybe this sounds picky, but I know what to expect, and this was not it. For 70,000 points a night ++, we just want what is expected, let alone standard.On another note, there were never enough doormen. I struggled with those double doors and the stroller+kids on a few occasions, and it was quite frustrating.Overall, here are my recommendations1) Pay. if you use points, you clearly are not valued2) Come alone. This is not an environment for kids. I don't think the staff really knew what to do with them, and I didn't see many of them. When i asked about their Ritz Kids offering, I received blank stares (or silence, via phone)3) Get a HIGH floor, park view. 4) Be prepared for the smell of horses in the lobby and in the low floors5) Actually, go downtown and stay at the Ritz Carlton Battery park. The service, food and ambiance is amazing. Yes, it is downtown, but it doesn't matter who you are---the doors will be opened for you, the food will be amazing, and people will be kind to you in the truest sense from the ladies and gentlemen at Battery park. If you must be at Central Park, Essex House is down the street and a good deal less expensive for similar perks and much better service.The pluses (because it wasn't ALL bad) were the amazing, hard working housekeeping team who always had a smile, warm greeting and were quick and efficient (and we tipped them well!) There was one particular doorman, a larger gentleman with a teddy bear quality and deep tenored voice, who was the picture of NY doormen, always with a genuine greeting and kind smile. The concierges were particularly outstanding, offering complete information, friendly smiles, and were easily accessible, especially the blonde concierge (can't remember her name!) I appreciate that they had multiple suggestions for theater tickets (from how to navigate the TKTS booth to the $400 pp tickets their broker could secure for us)Truth: We won't be back--at least, not as long as Brian and George are still at this location. I have too much respect for myself to be treated the way we were, and won't go through that again. If you can't or won't honor an upgrade (that is, remember, entitled to us), then just say so straight up and let us make decisions accordingly. Don't disrespect me by lying about it. Battery park is just too close to go through that again.","Gaithersburg, Maryland","tcamp33</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gaithersburg, Maryland</strong>",56,2.0

My husband was unable to accompany me on the trip so two girlfriends went with me - thus we requested a room with 2 double beds. Just beware - apparently they only have one room with double beds per floor and this does not come with a park or a city view, rather the view of the wall of another building 2 feet in front of you outside every window. Needless to say our room was not equipped with the fabled telescope so many others mentioned. The bathroom in the room was huge and very nice with a separate shower and tub and enough room for 3 ""girls"" to get ready in at the same time.This being New York , we were not in our room all that much and I will have to say that when it comes to Concierge services the Ritz is top notch. The Concierge assisted us with several reservations prior to our arrival. On the afternoon we checked in we mentioned that we wanted to stop by somewhere for a quick drink prior to dinner and before we even unpacked our bags an envelope was slipped under the door with spot on recommendations.The dinner reservation (Beauty & Essex) and lunch reservation (ABC Kitchen) that the Concierge recommended and made for us were exceptional and provided the exact tailored experience we had requested.Of course you can't beat the Central Park location and getting a cab is a breeze. Additionally, we were always greeted by name each morning down in the lobby by the endearing Enders (sp?).One thing we found peculiar was that when they do turn down service they place the pillows in the window behind the drapes. The first night we returned we had no idea where our pillows were and called housekeeping for more, only to discover the others the next morning.All in all we had a great experience, but had I been paying don't know if I could justify the additional $200+ per night it costs to stay there over other hotels.","Birmingham, Alabama","Karly F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",27,4.0

Planned a girls shopping trip to NYC 6 months ago and booked Ritz over other considerations. Have stayed at Ritz- Central Park one other time many years ago with family and had a magical experience. So in the efforts to recreate the last experience I booked again. In my opinion the location can not be beat (I am shocked when folks say they don't like mid town, sooooo much to do within feet from hotel). From the second you arrive you are made to feel increadably special, amazing welcoming staff. We splurged and upgraded to club level (highly recommend for many reasons), so we checked in and headed to club level for a much needed cocktail. The Club lounge is beautiful and very welcoming. Equiped with heavy appetizers, wine, champagne, bottled water, etc it was a sight for sore eyes (We had been traveling for @ 9 hours). Within a minute of arriving, Lazar who was on duty asked if we would like a beverage we said yes 'Martini's please' (can't say enough about how much we enjoyed Lazar, great personality, great martini maker, great representative to the hotel). The room was very lovely, what you would expect of a Ritz. The location of this hotel is right accross the street of central park, blocks from the best shopping anywhere in the world and you can walk to Time Square & Theatre district. Sit in the lobby bar and it's people watching galore. Keep eyes pealed you just might see a celeb or two.

Only one room per floor has double beds, but you can always ask for a rollaway if you need it. The property's rooms are the older English style, but very, very well appointed and manicured. The room was pristine and the bathrooms are very up to date and more modern than the rest of the room's style. The gym has no view, but is adequate for basic workouts. The lobby bar/cafe is beautifully done and has the feel of old world New York. Make sure you stop in. Also, ask for a room with a view of Central Park.

We usually book the Surrey for our trips to NYC but the Ritz had a promotion with American Express Platinum that was hard to beat. Room upgrade, food credit and third night free. Everything about the hotel was charming. The room was lovely and the bathroom updated and sparkling. The service was impeccable and it has the feel of a boutique hotel rather than a large NYC hotel. Our only complaint (if you could even call it that) was the hords of crowds right outside on 59th street and the pedi-cabs and the horse carts with somewhat aggressive hawkers. Growing up in NYC it was interesting to see how tourists are mobbed with crazy offers to ride around Central Park. But I guess it's comparable to a Gondola ride in Venice!

They must have some new staff in the reception/ entrance area that they did not go out of their way to make us feel special, especially since we were celebrating my birthday. Unlike other reviewers, I happen to like the decor and I'll be disappointed if they renovate. We went to have a drink to the beautiful lounge before dinner and we were asked to move to another table because they had reserved our table for others. This would be fine if there was a ""reserved"" sign on the table but there was none. Then the waitress could not make eye contact, or a conversation. Too shy? The newly renovated restaurant lacks in service and food quality but not in prices. There some great restaurants close to the hotel (Marea, Benoit), so I would avoid the hotel restaurant.

Our afternoon tea was exceptional, including a variety of tea sandwiches, champagne and earl gray tea. No it was not cheap, but anyone concerned about price tags needs to skip this hotel altogether.

The drawback to the hotel was that the fitness center was a little small. The weight area of the fitness center was nice, but the cardio area was pushed together with the machines on top of one another. The lighting over some of the cardio machines, such as the treadmills, was like a spotlight and emitted a tremendous amount of heat. Stay away from those machines.

We stayed at this hotel about two years ago (I failed to write review) so we somewhat knew what to expect. We were contacted prior to our arrival to find out if there was anything that could be done in preparation for our arrival. One of the few things we requested was not to be given a handicap accessible room. When we arrived after a long messed up day of travel we were placed in a handicap accessible room on the sixth floor. No door on toilet room, no bathtub for our two year old, grab bars all over the place. Called the desk and was moved to another room on the third floor. This room overlooked the top of a scaffolding that had work stuff all over it and blocked the first lane of Sixth Avenue where the parade would be. It ruined the view and would have ruined any pictures I had hoped to take. I called the desk again, asked manager to come to room. It is now around 10pm and I have a two year old! She informs me the rooms I had been offered were all that was left for the parade view but that certain guests were not there for the parade and would be checking out of ideal rooms the next day. At this point I am baffled that I, the customer who paid $1500 per night many months in advance am given the leftover crummy rooms. But someone who is paying probably half that amount and isn't even there for the parade view is in the good parade view room? I got pretty upset-wanted to cry. After going back and forth with the night manager begging her to do something she called with ""good news"". She had a guest move out of an ideal parade view room on the sixth floor. We had to wait for the room to be cleaned and they comped us dinner at their restaurant while we waited. When we finally got in what should have been our room all along it was perfect. The room was very clean (maybe the cleanest I've ever stayed in) except the outside of the windows were quite dirty. After a couple of phone calls they came and were able to swing the window open from the inside and cleaned them really well. The two large windows were perfect for watching the parade. The have a huge ledge you can actually sit in, my toddler stood in, and you can crank them open at the top and hear the sounds.They really did not do anything special for the Thanksgiving Holiday or for the customers paying huge amounts for the view. Their ""Parade View Package"" turned out to be nothing beyond the room and hot chocolate on the morning of the parade. That seems pretty silly to me. I don't think someone paying $1500/night for a basic little room is really going to think hot chocolate is a great deal. Besides we aren't eight years old! Hot chocolate?! I would have much rather had a nice welcome note from management saying ""Happy Thanksgiving, thanks for staying with us"". A small fruit basket maybe? A couple drink vouchers? They often do things like that at Ritz Carlton even if you're NOT there for something special! Disappointing!I give the rating four stars because the room was very clean (big deal to me!) and all problems ended up fixed in the end. We had an unbelievable view of the parade! But I am still pretty shocked about our initial room assignments and their lack of attention to detail for the guests there for the very costly ""Parade View Package"".","Atlanta, Georgia","leighbell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",38,4.0

Rooms are smallish, but very well-appointed. The lobby is small and very understated. This is definitely a Ritz which flies under the radar and feels more like an apartment building than a hotel.I have stayed here many times on business. The service is good and it's hard to find fault. As a business traveler, the hotel is on the pricer side. Rates fluctuate, but it's not uncommon to pay close close to $1000 a night (or more) for a modest non-suite room, which is nearly double the price to stay of the neighboring Essex House (which happens to be a very nice property, at least while it was in the hands of Jumeriah...We will see what Marriot does with it).","Boston, Massachusetts","rome1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",106,4.0

When we travel for vacations ( which we don't usually do in our own city) we normally stay at the best hotels. Especially in capital or large cities. We have been very lucky to have stayed at some of the most luxurious properties but, clearly, i am a tourist in all the cities except in New York. It was a strange experience. And I tried to see this hotel from the perspective of knowing Manhattan inside out and as a tourist from out of town. (I often don't end reviewing on tripadvisor as often as I should so I do apologize to all of you who are so faithful about reporting back.)We needed a two bedroom suite. We wanted a Central Park-facing suite. They had no two Bedroom suites, per se: but we were offered a one bedroom Central Park suite with a deluxe room right next to it,although it did not connect. The room was for our 12 th grade daughter so she was okay on her own but I would have preferred an arrangement where we could have all been in one suite.The suite was large...that is the living room and the bedroom in the one Bedroom suite facing the park. Lots of windows. The connecting deluxe room was dark and faced Sixth Avenue. You could sneak a peak of the Park but it was a dreary room and not that large. For an expensive deluxe room I felt it was not nearly nice enough.Even for the suite: The decor was really not very stylish in my opinion. Ritz Carltons generally are very traditional in decor. Lots of gold and swagged draperies. Lots of brocade and fringe. It really seems very dated and not especially clean at all.. A number of their properties have become sleeker, and it's certainly not that I prefer minimalist style. But I feel if you are going with elegant and traditional it should be more authentic, with first class fabrics and well-planned decor: it should definitely not be cheesy and the Ritz Carlton felt cheesy and unfashionable. The suites we occupied at the St. Regis during this stint away from home were much more elegant in every way. Night and day....and service as well. This Ritz Carlton just seemed the right side of shabby....barely. And the Housekeeping was just uninspired. Finger marks on glass tops that serve as furniture protectors, grimy dust in corners people don't usually look in, dirt around switch plate covers, sheets tucked in very sloppily, wrinkled and rumpled. And dirty windows really hampered that amazing view that so many visitors come to see and enjoy.As a tourist, I could see loving the Ritz Carlton because the view is fabulous. However, one unfortunate drawback that is not the hotel's fault is the odor from the horses directly opposite the hotel. The carriages and horses line up in a long, long line and the smell wafts directly into the hotel. Please, do not open the windows under any circumstances because the smell from the horses across the way is unbelievable! New York really does not smell like horses and their own ""waste"". The city has been very vigilant that the carriage drivers keep things very sanitary, but the smell is just over the top no matter how scrupulously clean the streets are kept. We really loved the Club Lounge. Sadly, it seems that one must stay on a Club Floor to really be able to count on great service. Trying to jostle for a spot in the bar or a table in the casual eating area is really unpleasant. And the only place at the Ritz Carlton where the service is truly personalized is in the Club Lounge. And the complimentary food and drinks are just so nice to be able to enjoy.As a native of Manhattan, I would like to say that Central Park South is not, in and of itself, a great street. It seems as if it would be because of its proximity to the park, Carnegie Hall, the Plaza, breat stores and even Lincoln Center. But Central Park South is especially very touristy. Plus, because it is the last street before the Park, there are no buildings opposite the hotel to keep that side of the street spotless and really inviting. In New York each building is really in charge of maintaining the decorum and cleanliness of its own sidewalks. . A lot of nonsense and noise can just happen across the street, outside the Park, even if it's just scads of trinket stands and some really unruly, noisy groups of people now and then. I would hope the revelry or whatever would never affect the experience of those of us staying at the hotel. But I was bothered by loud crowds late at night, for example.That is definitely, without question, not the fault of the hotel, so I would never blame the hotel. I'm just saying there are better locations. And very close by. In fact the Ritz Carlton is in a very convenient location as a base for sightseeing and shopping but you dont need to stay on that slightly seedy street to have all the advantages of the location. But you pretty much do have to stay there if you want that amazing view. (there are a few other hotels with similarly great views but they may be more expensive for the premium of the full-on Central Park view.What the hotel is at fault for, in my experience, is very poor service Ina number of areas. Compared to other five star luxury, full service hotels in Manhattan, the front reception staff is rude and they do not even pretend to be happy to see you. They act neither elegant and poised or friendly and competent. They are easily exasperated for no reason. They do not extend themselves beyond whatever it is they must actually be doing in order to keep their jobs. I checked in and out twice during our five weeks (they couldn't accomodate us for one long stay, we had to keep switching). And only after a great deal of exasperation and bad attitude did I insist on speaking to a manager. She was very apologetic and sent us complimentary champagne, but I would rather have had good service. Housekeeping was definitely hit or miss, which is not acceptable in this level of hotel. Only after the aforementioned manager flagged us as ""VIP"" guests (for whatever reason) did we get personal attention from housekeeping, room service, and even the host at the bar started to acknowledged us by name and ""found""seats for us, etc.All in all, there are so many excellent choices in Manhattan in the same price category and in the same type of luxury class that are better located, have much more professional and customer-centered service.I can understand that it has a special location because of its famous view into Central Park. But you are giving up a huge amount of service and quality of accommodations, food and all around decor and ambience as well as actual location for that view. I stayed at four other hotels of the same calibre and price during that time, all within the same basic area. This one, this Ritz Carlton, by far, had the least to offer in every aspect.A few ""buts""....For example,....the Club Lounge was really, really nice, and a welcoming place to relax. Also, the gentleman from housekeeping who would make up the sofa bed for my son every evening worked very hard and was proud of his hard work and was extremely friendly.. We met nice people in the Club Lounge who were visiting New York and it was fun to have nice people to chat with. I just felt sorry for the out of town guests who were not getting treated as well as possible, especially if they were not on the Club Floor. In my opinion, they were not getting great advice from the concierge, etc.","Paris, France","Lori M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",212,3.0

That left me with about a half-hour to check in and to get ready for a big meeting. As I waited to get my keys, a friendly front desk employee offered me a bottle of water and warm welcome. Within a few quick minutes I was in my room, quickly unpacking. I phoned room service for what would be my first of three interactions with Denise, one of the best hotel employees I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I explained the situation and she and her team rushed a shrimp cocktail to my room in about 10 minutes! After my meeting, I ordered a Kobe beef burger with avocado - perfectly prepared and again, it was in my room in record time. The next night, I was debating a delicious cobbler because it came with lavendar ice cream. Denise offered to give me a dip of vanilla as well in case I wasn't crazy about the lavendar - turns out, they were both excellent. All three meals were delivered by incredibly friendly waiters as well. Everyone I encountered, from the maids to the doormen to the Spa employees were friendly and efficient. As for the rooms, they are bright and comfortable with an impressive marble bathroom and all the little extras the chain includes, like collar stays, mouthwash, Woolite, etc. The fitness center and locker area are top notch and the location, just down the street from The Plaza, makes it one of the best addresses in the City. I've been extremely blessed to stay in 5-star hotels on 6 continents. While I've always been partial to Four Seasons and Penninsula properties, the Ritz-Carlton Central Park is right up there... this stay put the hotel above even the Dorcester in London when it comes to service.

I find it to be just the opposite with all of the rich dark wood covering the walls. It was very opulent, warm and comforting. The common areas and the rooms smell so good in the hotel, it was one of the first things that I noted. We did not have a park view room, our view was of a brick wall. I didn't mind this too much as we were not in our room very much. I found the rooms to be very comfortable and the bathrooms to be very spacious with great amenities. Also, the beds were extremely comfortable. The location is great for exploring central park, an easy walk to radio city and 30 rock, and a so close to many great restaurants and shopping. I would highly recommend!","Saint Louis, Missouri","imacubsfan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",31,5.0

Location perfect, close to and for days of sightseeing, shopping, eating and the best theater in the world BROADWAY. For the first time visitor(s) do the hop on hop off buss and spend an hour or so being driven around learning about areas you might not have time to visit real-time during your firsts stay. NOW Time Square is NOT the end all be all place to hang out, don't do it don't do it. I hear from friends and other travelers that they spent most of their time in Time Square and left thinking NYC was not all that great. Ok, from the time you drive up to the unassuming doors and the gentlemen meet and greet you with a sincere welcome, you know your in for nothing but the most humble gracious serves! And yes that's what happens. Walk through the doors smell that intoxicating sent in the air and turn left and greet the front desk staff, they will assure each guest they are welcome and at their beckon call for any need you might have!! As the staff guides you to the elevator look left and see the welcoming finely appointed gathering area, they also serve a perfect High Tea. Then into the elevators and up to your guest room, jr. suite or suite, and when booking I suggest a corner Ave/Park view suite and of course the higher you go the better the view, winter, summer, spring or fall the views of Central Park never fail to impress. I also suggest you book a club level suite, or a room/suite with club level access. The Club Room is on the 2nd floor oh shoot is it the 3rd floor? You'll find it. The many ""presentations"" daily are creative and just plain YUMMY! It's world class style all the way. I have in-laws that can't keep the NYC pace so this is the perfect place to plop them into and go see the city. The rooms will not disappoint the bathrooms will entice you to primp a little longer and a soak in the tub will ensure you made the right choice to stay here. I had the great pleasure of meeting Ms. Cynthia Chung while in residence one stay, if you ever get to meet this AMAZING woman, you will never forget it! She knows EVERYTHING about her property and it's guests. She is one of the most distinguish woman I have ever met. Room serves is superb and served with impeccable grace and style, the bath and pillow menus will temp you to try new products and ensure a pleasant slumber. If you want over the top morsels for dinner, your just an elevator ride away. Men will need a jacket and you women get away with whatever you wear. This is such an elegant dining experience and the flavors will open new taste buds in your mouth, and begging for more. Now for those of you who want to know the ""score"" just go next door and take that jacket off, order a beer and watch all the sports you want. I feel like I could go on and on about this property... They are extremely pet friendly and my Westies LOVE driving to the front doors and getting to check in and get to their park view suite and lounge on the window sills and watch out the windows at the park and horses down below. Gosh have I covered everything? If not let me know, always happy to assist. Travel smart/safe and enjoy.

I booked a city view room and was pleasantly surprised when our attendant pressed the elevator button for the 22nd floor. I was completely blown away when the door opened to a room with uninterrupted views of Central Park. We'd been upgraded and this was the PERFECT way for them to break the news! The surprises kept coming at breakfast when we were shown into the hotel's newly opened restaurant. I mean ""newly opened"" in that it was still ""closed for renovations"" the night before. Like the rest of the hotel, the restaurant is simple, low-key sophistication. As mentioned by many other reviewers, the rooms are elegant and the bedding is first rate. We felt like we were sleeping in a warm cloud. We quickly fell into a deep sleep and were only woken by the alarm we set the night before. The only hiccup was that our room was set-up for a guest of Islamic faith. Being an Atheist, I had no need for a Koran, didn't need to know the direction of Mecca and would have liked some booze in my mini bar.

No pool onsite, but access is given to a nearby gym at reasonable rates apparently. - Small but beautiful elevators- Only hotel that I have been to that has Opus One and Johnny Blue bottles available for purchase in each room. - We had free wi-wi in room- We had Club access and that is our favorite way to go at the Ritz. Some pros and cons include: * Lots of food and coffee when needed * Some flies on cheese * Helpful and nice people / service * Great breakfast * Repeated menu EVERY single day... a bit boring. - Got free parking with one of my rooms, but not the other. Would have been $65/day (!) - Nice amount of pens, paper, soaps, and other useful items in room including currency power converter for international devices- Choice of AM newspapers- Extremely fair at checkout... anything we didn't agree with was immediately taken off our bill. Cons:- Horses hang out across the street and often lobby has horse-smell. - Cigarette smell in EACH of three hotel rooms that I was in during my stay. After about 5 minutes in the room you wont notice it any more. - Very few, if any, rooms with two beds in them... - The employee's two way radios do not work in every room, causing delays- In room safe is too small for laptop- Welcome water was offered by front desk, but could have been helpful in the room instead. - Requested to see if an upgrade was available at checkin -- maybe, but only for additional money. - Do not even think of getting a room not facing central park in this hotel. Not only does it not face central park, it faces NOTHING.

I was on Honeymoon with my new wife and neither of us had stayed at a Ritz Carlton hotel before. I chose the hotel, because it had consistently high ratings on the Internet, both from experts and everyday guests. Firstly, the location of the hotel is a dream. It sits on the corner of 6th Ave and Central Park South. For those of you are unfamiliar with the layout of Manhattan, that means you will be a 10 minute walk from Times Square, 5 minutes from 5th Avenue (a shoppers paradise) and about 30 seconds from Central Park. It is a prime location and Central Park South is widely considered to be the street with the best hotels in NYC. I was offered 3 types of deluxe rooms: a standard; a city view and a park view. The prices go up in that order by about $50 per night. I chose the city view, as I was more keen to get a view of the streets of NYC. I asked to be high up, expecting a rooftop view and was given a room on the 16th floor. Unfortunately, only when I got to the room did I realize that hotel is surrounded by some pretty tall buildings and so the view that you get is simply the side surface of surrounding buildings. Nevertheless, you get amazing views of the streets below. My room was on 6th Ave and almost at the central park corner, so I also had a partial park view. The view of the park was lovely, and there was even a fireworks display from the park one night. In retrospect, if I was expecting to spend a lot of time in the room, I would definitely opt for the park view room. As for the room itself... All I can says it that it was true 5-star luxury. Modern cushioned wallpaper welcomes you, with vintage furniture pieces interspersed throughout the room. The deluxe room was very comfortably sized, with a work-desk, a coffee table and 2 single-seater vintage chairs to complement the king-size bed and flatscreen TV. Another hotel that I had previously stayed at while in NYC had an ultra-modern look, which made it feel quite cold and not welcoming. The Ritz was quite the opposite. Low lighting throughout the room and subtle colors make you feel like royalty. The room was very clean with extremely luxurious bedding. The bathroom was a masterpiece on its own. A modern marble look greets you and luxury doesn't begin to describe the impression it creates. As for the service staff, they were truly amazing. We received individual service and were always greeted with a smile. There's always complimentary fresh coffee and a range of teas in the lobby area for those who are getting an early start to the day. The hotel has a La Prairie brand spa which I went to with my wife, but I will discuss this in a separate review. Overall, I can say without a doubt that this is the grandest hotel I have ever stayed in. It's has the kind of luxury which is understated enough to let you know it's there without looking like it's been put there to grab attention. This hotel rivals the attractions of Manhattan by putting them at arms reach, but at the same time providing you with a reason to sleep in every now then.",,Virsen,6,5.0

This was not the case this last weekend. First of all, we had requested early check-in, which we fully realize is not guaranteed. What we were not prepared for, however, was that our room would not be ready until almost a full hour after check-in time. This seemed to be the fault of Housekeeping, which indeed is not what it used to be. Formerly, you never saw tacky housekeeping carts in the hall. This time, not only were they in the hall but left there overnight. We were disappointed to find that our bath towels were very threadbare -- shouldn't Housekeeping be taking these out of circulation? This is, after all, the Ritz, at very steep prices. But most of all, the Club Room disappointed. It appears that the hotel is overselling the Club Room, resulting in very crowded conditions -- similar to an airport lounge. And when would you have expected to see small children in the Club Room standing on chairs and jumping off them? Isn't the Club Room supposed to provide a serene experience? I felt sorry for the Club Room personnel who have been there for years -- you could tell they were embarrassed by the crowds. Hotel management needs to rethink their policies -- possibly limiting club access to older children. All in all, this was our first disappointing experience at the Ritz.","New York City, New York","newyorker905</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,4.0

This one is not as nice as the one in Grand Cayman or New Orleans or St. Thomas. The facilities in those locations are nicer and the staff, believe it or not, are better there, particularly in Grand Cayman which is truly beyond belief. This is not to say the staff at Central Park Ritz are not nice and helpful. They are, but I rank the Central Park Ritz about an 7.5 on a 10 scale. Examples of so-so service include the 4 calls it took just to reach someone at the front desk not at a busy time. It seems they just didn't want to answer their phone. And, in the club, it was clear that those who were regulars at this location rated better service as I was wholly ignored for long stretches while they conversed with them. The room was a king central park view which was nice, but small and nothing special in comparison to what you would see at other destinations, particularly for the $$$$ you spend for such a room. For example, in St. Thomas, you get more than twice the room quality and size for 2/3 the money. A glass of champagne in this facility will run you $35 and that is for a quality that you could buy a bottle for in a liquor store for $40. With all the foregoing said, it is a nice hotel, I just would not get club access next time as it is not worth it. The food and alcohol there are not that much or special. The highest floor my type of room could be obtained was the 9th floor which is okay, but if you really want a nice view, you have to pay much more to get higher. My room with club access and the view was $1K per night. If I was going to stay on Central Park, then I would consider the hotel again. If not, I would consider other locations as there are many options. I give it only 3/5 due to the value for what you get.","Houston, Texas","Katman77382</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",2,3.0

Decorated in the style that you would expect from the Ritz (not modern) but extremely comfortable...and a great bathroom.What makes this a 5 star review are all the nice touches that we were treated to, including chocolate covered strawberries in the room on arrival; a delicious birthday cake waiting for us after we returned from dinner; staff at our beck and call for whenever we needed the smallest thing; all the staff knowing you by name; the best spa treatment ever (according to wife), etc...Highly recommended for a special occasion.","London, United Kingdom","Fadi S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

As other reviewers have said, this hotel is an oasis in the middle of the hustle & bustle of the the city.

Easy subway access, too. We paid extra for club level access - thoroughly worth it when you consider all of the food and drink offerings. For example, my cocktail in the Hotel's lounge was $18 but was free when I ordered it in the Club. The hotel gym, though not large, is adequate. Only 4 treadmills;however, there was never any one else in the facility. The concierge desk was extremely helpful & friendly - they appeared very busy most of the time. No real complaints at all. We had friends staying in a hotel next door & they couldn't sleep one night because of a thunderstorm that went through. Not an issue at all at the Ritz. Very good insulation & the our cooling system ran almost constantly providing a white noise. We stayed 3 nights at the Peninsula (on 5th Avenue) 6 months ago.

I erred on the side of generosity but 3.5 stars would have been more accurate. This hotel has a lot going for it as far as the hardwiring is concerned- to start the location is perfection - around the corner from Fifth Avenue and right across from Central Park. You have the best of New York laid at your feet. The rooms are timelessly elegant and generous in size. The bed among the best I have ever experienced... BUT to quote Gertrude Stein ""There is no there there"". The staff and service, the soul of any great hotel, are wildly disparate and range from truly excellent to borderline disgruntled. Several times there was no one at the door including when I first arrived with luggage in the middle of the afternoon and after arriving back after the theatre late at night. Check in was somewhat perfunctory and it was the first time I was not upgraded as an Amex Plat card holder which is fair enough if they have no rooms available however upon check-in the guaranteed late checkout of 4pm was confirmed by the clerk at her initiative which I did appreciate. On my final day, at a little after the regular check out time I received a call thanking me for the stay and well, in short asking me to leave! Taken aback but thinking this was a misunderstanding, I assured the clerk that the guaranteed check out at 4pm was confirmed by one of his colleagues but instead of apologizing he just asked me when I would leave and said that my keycard (which is used for both the room and elevator and was faulty the entire time of my 3 night stay) would no long work and if I intended on staying I would have to come to the front desk. I was so disgusted I packed up and left with a very bitter taste in my mouth and astonished at the rudest treatment I have ever experienced at any hotel. I am the type of person who always checks out 5 minutes before the time and If they were pressured for rooms they could have handled this a lot better. To add insult to injury the bill contained several mischarges in the favor of the hotel including all three breakfasts (which were included in my rate) charged as lunch. It was quickly remedied but still this shouldn't happen at a hotel of this caliber. While I rather like this hotel doesn’t have a large impersonal lobby it is missing a great bar like Bemelmans at the Carlyle or the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis.

Not a single slip. Room was perfect and just what we had expected. Employees I had not even met greeted us by name (I've got to figure out how they do that? Do they have pictures of guests in the employee lounge?)... everyone greeted us with that warm ""welcome home"". It was a one night trip up to see a Barry Manilow concert at Radio City. We mentioned that to the staff when we checked in. After a great evening on the town and at the concert, we returned to our room to find Chocolate Covered Strawberries, the lights and bed turned down and a Barry Manilow romantic CD playing in the Bose sound system. My wife freaked... a note accompanied the CD indicating that it was a gift to help us remember our visit with them.... are you kidding me. New York, Central Park, Ritz Carlton... your going to pay, but who cares? This hotel and this staff have no rivals if it is an exceedingly memorable visit to New York you desire. If you're just looking for a cheap bed, this is not your place. Highlights are the Location, Central Park, Staff, The club lounge. Like all in New York, the rooms are relatively small, but better than most. The hotel is old, but fresh. One of the top properties in the US.

It was a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay here again.Our experience began a week before we arrived when the concierge desk helped me make arrangements for airport transportation, and some restaurant reservations. Everyone at the concierge desk was helpful and friendly, but Brian and Tim were especially wonderful! Their suggestions for restaurants and hints for sightseeing were perfect! In fact, our best meal of the trip was at Quality Meats (Tim's suggestion).Shortly after we checked in, treats were delivered to all of our rooms...lovely fruit bowls for the adults rooms and a bowl full of cookies and chocolate candies to my children's room. This was an unexpected treat and was a big hit, especially with my girls.We were in 2 connecting rooms on the 19th floor and a suite on the 18th floor. All the rooms were spacious and clean, with very large bathrooms. The suite was a city view suite, but even had incredible park views from the living room. Beds were very comfortable and linens were soft and luxurious.We ate breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant. The food was delicious and plentiful, and the service was outstanding. The French toast and the hot chocolate were especially delicious! The only negative experience we had at the hotel involved the lounge area. The lounge area itself is lovely and the seating is comfortable. Unfortunately, one of the lounge employees named Lisa is truly unpleasant. On 2 different occasions, she got our order wrong. Neither time did she offer to correct it, and seemed irritated when we pointed out the errors. Thankfully, she was the only negative in our week at the Ritz.The location of the hotel (on the south end of Central Park) made it perfect for walking to most destinations (museums, shopping and Times Square are all within easy walking distance). When we didn't feel like walking, the doormen were quick to arrange the house car or a taxi. The doormen are all wonderful! They always greet you with a smile and kind word, and most greeted us by name.This property is outstanding in so many ways, but the incredible customer service is what truly sets it apart from others.

We were to have a city view room, but instead we faced another brick building with no view whatsoever. We typically receives upgrades due to his status, this did not happen and we did not receive the room we paid and requested with the city view. No apology or a discount on the room. The rooms are large and quiet. The bed was extremely comfortable. The housekeeping service was lacking. We only received one water bottle the entire weekend. We had to keep asking for towels as we were provided with only one bath towel for two people. The housekeeper cleaned the room and then left her dirty rag on the sink, and no toilet paper in the bathroom. It was nothing major that happened but little things like having to ask for toilet paper when you are paying $700/night for a room is a bit ridiculous.

Understandable, but after waiting for 10 minutes 4 different times we went to ask for help at the front desk for recommendations. They did acknowledge you but has to continue their conversations.

We have stayed at the Four Seasons the last few years for my husband’s birthday, they always send up a small cake, card and sometimes a bottle of champagne. The Ritz Carlton- nothing. They did not even acknowledge we were here celebrating his birthday, after this was noted in the reservation and I had called several days before to confirm reservation and mention this. This was disappointing. We ate at the hotel for breakfast as we had a $100 credit to use. If you stuck to the menu the prices were not unreasonable, however if you ordered something that was not on the menu the price was steep. I ordered one egg on the side and it was $14, this was funny as my entire pancake breakfast with pancakes, fruit and a drink was only $20. The location is directly across from Central Park and in an ideal location for walking to various sites. We are returning for another weekend in NYC in 2 weeks.

That said we have had occasion to do so twice this year. The Central Park South location is your typical Ritz experience. Attentive/Friendly staff, understated but warm lobby/common areas and opulent rooms with many small details. Our room was spotless, sizable (for New York) and very quite.The only issue we had was the absence of an iron in the room. This was noticed about an hour before my wife needed to leave for a meeting and it took the whole hour for them to bring one to us, thus she had to go out wrinkly. So if you need to touch up your clothes before going out call way ahead for an iron. The strange bit is that other Ritz locations have irons in the room.I should probably mention that the room was over $1200/night. While it was a great hotel, with famous Ritz service and a great location, our regular room was by no means worth that price. You can stay around the corner on 5th for half that price at a few other of New York's best (historic) hotels.

Great for a family stay.Everything outside the room itself was difficult to take. Upon check in (we arrived at 4:30pm) we were told our room was not ready. We waited in the Club Lounge while it was being readied. No communication from the front desk, we waited two and a half hours for our room to be ready. Unfortunately this was the second time in a week that we've checked into a Ritz Carlton property after our quoted check in time and had to wait over two hours for it to be ready. The front desk told up it would not be long, so we waited. Had we known it would be a few hours, we would have left and done something, it actually ruined our plans for that evening. The Club Lounge felt cold. It does not have the warm feel at the Battery Park and other Ritz properties. The staff while not unfriendly, were cold and abrupt. We are never hard to please and don't ever ask for special requests, but it just didn't have a very welcoming vibe. The Lounge always felt crowded and people descended like locusts. I drink tea, so it was easy to make it myself, but for coffee, people were putting in requests like this was your local Starbucks. It was definitely off-putting. Our only really good staff experience was with our Bellman. He sent up a nice cheese plate and wine personally because he felt bad about how long we had to wait for our room. He always remembered our names and referenced specific details we'd shared about our itinerary and home. All in all I wouldn't stay here again.

Normally our experiences at any Ritz hotel has been exceptional, but unfortunately this time was a major disappointment. We booked the hotel by phone, received a confirmation at the time and received an email confirmation a week before we were to arrive. When we arrived we were told that they didn't have our reservation. When they looked into it more they told us that ""someone"" had changed our reservation and then canceled it - which made no sense since we never booked the room on-line, and an outsider can't get into your reservation and change it. But, the woman at the front desk kept insisting that they didn't change the reservation - ""someone else did it""?????But to make matters worse, she really didn't care that we were now stuck without a room. She essentially told us that no rooms were ready (at 4:00 in the afternoon - check in is at 3:00) and that any room that would be available would take at least 2 hours to clean. Again, no interest in accommodating us in the least. When we returned after 2 hours we were put in a tiny room (two adults and our 15 year old son). We could barely move in the room, but again, the woman at the front desk really couldn't be bothered, and since we needed a place to stay, we were in a bind.My husband did finally go down to complain and asked to see the manager (John Nomer), who was the only person who at least acted like he cared about our situation. He took us to see another available room, and was extremely apologetic.I understand that it's the holiday season and things get busy and hectic, but I expected more from the Ritz. I expected them to be more sympathetic to our situation, especially being return customers.My family and I will not be returning to the Ritz on Central Park next year or any year after.

The front desk did do their best to amend the situation. The only other issue which would not likely bother most was their packing/unpacking service. It was not bad but certainly was not English butler service, which while they do not market it as so I would have expected it at one of new Yorkshire best hotels.In summary our next stay will be right here at the Ritz Central Park.....we loved it.","London, United Kingdom","hawaiiboundstt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

On the plus side, our suite was roomy & comfortable with great views. It was also very quiet, which was nice after dealing with the holiday crowds and chaos on Fifth Ave & Rockefeller Center. Unfortunately the service wasn't as personable as I'd hoped and there was very little attention to detail. As another reviewer said, you feel like you are ""just another guest."" And at these rates, I expect a little more. Also, this property is not nearly as kid-friendly as other Ritzs (and we were traveling with our 7-year old).Overall, we enjoyed our stay but it fell just a little short of my expectations.

Everything was efficient, the hotel was spotless etc but I suppose these characteristics should be expected and a given.The rooms were very good indeed and I really can't imagine it's worth staying without the view of the Park.So why is it that I don't feel comfortable rating it a 5? I think because it probably didn't quite match our high expectations. Whilst staff were pleasant enough, they weren't overly friendly. It felt like we were just four of very many guests, which of course we were. However, I think that's what makes the key difference between a very good and an excellent hotel - the latter makes you feel special, even when you're not.Make no mistake, we have no regrets selecting this hotel, it really is very good.

First and foremost, this is honestly a wonderful hotel and I think the Ritz staff here is second to none. While I've visited the hotel before many times (former restaurant that is no longer there, La Prairie Spa, tea in the hotel lobby), I stayed in the hotel for the first time this past weekend.A disclaimer: I was treated for the weekend (courtesy of my mother in law) and did not pay for the room. I have no idea what our room rate was (nor do I want to know!) and I am sure that if I was paying out of pocket I would stay elsewhere...for example, I think the Ritz Battery Park seems to be a much better deal.Our room: We had a very decently sized room with a king bed and partial Central Park views (upgrade courtesy of booking through American Express). Allow me to digress...I have complained about the Ritz Rewards system in prior reviews; we are Silver members (staying at least 10 nights a year in Ritz properties) and my in-laws are Gold members. All of our amenities during this stay were provided through Amex and we did not receive anything due to our Ritz Rewards status. Every time we've asked the front desk about this, their response is that it's a new system, they don't know who is what tier at check-in, etc. I have even been told at other properties that having Silver status ""means nothing."" Regardless, the room was lovely and I have no complaints.The location: If you want to shop, this is the place to stay. The hotel is a very easy walk from 57th and Fifth (aka Mecca), where you'll find Bergdorf Goodman and the other usual suspects. It's also an easy walk up Madison Avenue (better shopping than on 5th and much fewer tourists). It's also walking distance to the Time Warner building. Obviously, it's across from Central Park, which is a huge plus except for the carriage horses that line up directly across from the hotel (it is my personal belief that the carriage rides should be stopped for animal welfare reasons, so this might not bother others).The restaurant (BLT): We received complimentary daily breakfast at the hotel, which here is at the adjacent BLT Market. I generally like BLT restaurants, but I am not a huge fan of this one. Breakfast was fine, although I certainly would not eat there if it wasn't free, as there are typical Ritz prices for very average fare (think $40 for a continental breakfast). On the second morning we had one of the rudest servers I've ever had and it took an hour for our food to arrive, although the food services manager did step in to make things right. We also had dinner here one night (to use up daily hotel credit) and it was fine, but again probably would not have gone if we didn't have the $ to use up.The lobby lounge: I love it in here. We had drinks and appetizers after checking out and had a wonderful hostess. Gorgeous setting, great drinks, decent (not amazing, but it will do the job) food.The spa: ""If you have the means, I highly suggest you [try the La Prairie spa]."" Even if you don't book a service, hotel guests have access to the spa facilities, which includes a somewhat mediocre steam room BUT access to all the La Prairie products you could ever desire (face wash, body cream, etc.). Services themselves are quite pricey. I have had a couple of amazing facials here and a couple of very disappointing ones. Like anywhere else, it depends on who your esthetician is. But overall, it's worth it just to experience the facilities. The staff: Great. I felt very taken care of during our stay, and any issues (poor experience with server at breakfast) were resolved expediently, although (again) I wish they would fix their Ritz Rewards system.In sum: This is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic area, but you'll pay for the privilege and there are (in my opinion) much better deals at on-par hotels to be found.","Washington, DC","bellagamba22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",10,4.0

We have allergies and the first night they had to move us to another room because of smoking in the adjacent room. The second room smelled from some horrible perfume that was sprayed to mask the smell of smoke. Low and behold our neighbor in the second room also smoked so basically our stay was miserable.The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating and explained to me that smoking is a big problem and that they fine smokers $500, but most smokers staying there don't mind paying the $500 .

We had drinks at the hotel bar every day we loved it so much - we just felt so welcome and comfortable there. We found the service outstanding - from the concierge to the door men - nothing was too much trouble and all staff were genuinely friendly - especially Abdel, Johnny, Bernard and Nazier (sp). One minor issue was there was that there is a charge for internet use in the business centre and also for wifi. However, the concierge let me use their iPad whenever I wanted. Could not recommend this hotel more and it will always be my hotel of choice in NY. Judy, Sydney Australia",Sydney,"Judy436</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",1,5.0

Everyone wants to help you, from the moment you check in, whether it is Orlando de Campo or anyone else, the Ritz creates the Gold standard for other high end hotels to meet. From the floors, the furniture, paneled elevators you can feel the upscale everywhere. People remember your name, which a challenge for me. The rooms are very well apportioned, the bath area seemed as large as our entire room in other locations. Lots of beautiful people everywhere, I felt out of place.  We had a very, very nice stay with several nice surprises, fruit delivered to the room, and a CD of the Musical that we attended. We would have loved to stay longer, but had to return to reality.

This was our 4th stay at the Central Park Ritz and of course it was as fabulous as always. But of course, I post a new review with each visit because there are always updates!Remember - this gorgeous hotel is not cheap. The lowest rates I have ever seen were for 595 per night. So if you count your pennies stay somewhere else. But keep in mind - I did not hear the word ""no"" even once. My husband, 3 kids, sitter and inlaws came and we all had a blast. There were some snafus at check in - not sure if this was the fault of the hotel or Amex but they worked it out. The locationnom central park is great. For families, hit the m and m store, the bike rides and victorian gardens in the Park, serendipity 3 (of course), Dylans candy shop, etc.Also, if you can afford it, purchase club lounge access. The food is top notch and the service can simply NOT be matches anywhere. Carmelinda the club concierge is wonderful. Lazar is the man with the most. He is an amazing server in the club lounge - he will anticipate and meet your needs. And I imagine he has stories we could not fathom.This trip I did find that housekeeping and room service were both not as responsive and speedy as usual. With summer, maybe they are short staffed?? Also the spa is good, small but with well done services. The La Prairie products are exorbitantly priced. Seriously - 495 for a moisturizer? That's ridiculous.

Housekeeper said she thoght last guest burned incense. I called and asked for another but none available. Smell increased after turn down (more perfume) so at midnight when we got back we were told ""now we have rooms"" and offered a move but kids already asleep, and all our stuff already unpacked. We also booked package that included Central Park Lake boatride. We made reservation with hotel and when we arrived at boathouse as instructed by hotel staff but we still had to pay as there was no record of hotel booking. To their credit, hotel did reimburse and gavve us an extra $70 off the bill for this inconvenience, but would have been better if got it right the first time. Very expnesive place - one plain iced tea (no alcohol) and Pellegrino in lounge was $27.00 with tip. Service in Lobby Lounge was overwhelmed.

I booked a Deluxe Avenue Suite with Club Access and looked forward to a pleasant stay. Unfortunately I was more than a little disappointed.Check-in was fine and certainly the lobby is small but nicely maintained but on walking into the suite I was struck by the strongest carpet deodorizer imaginable. It was horrible and permeated the entire place. I told the desk clerk to please make sure this was not used again. Now maybe it wasn't but the smell never faded and really made the place quite unpleasant to relax in. The rooms were fine with a reasonable living room and bedroom and one small bath and one decent sized, but the furniture was a dated Federalist revival and the carpets were slightly worn. Not what I would expect of a five star hotel in Manhattan. Maid service continued to be a disappointment with wet towels being left in the bath on two occasions and a broken remote for the Bang and Olufsen not being repaired after 3 calls to the front desk. Service elsewhere was similiarly poor - a call to the concierge about a desired restaurant reservation was unsuccesful and yet when I called Eleven Madison myself they were able to get me in!! I'd flatter myself that my name carries more weight than the Clefs D'Or's concierges at the Ritz but I know thats not the case, leaving me to assume that they simply never called. The club lounge is fine with a pleasant assortment of food and drink available but to try and get a glass of champagne or even a cup of coffee in the morning seems tantamount to an insult and again there is always the expectation that to greet a server you need to have a 20 dollar bill in your outstretched hand. A dinner at BLT, the american bistro attached to the hotel was horrendous with an hour wait between appetizer and entree and the maitre'd finally admitting that the meal ticket had been misplaced, and for the piece de resistance upon checkout when a car to the airport was requested two hours in advance - no car showed up.All of these errors would be acceptable in a 3 or 4 four star hotel but at the Ritz where the expectation is that you'll give someone 20 dollars for opening a door it really is quite unpleasant. I'm not sure if staying in the Presidential Suite gives you some access to what really good service is supposed to look like but if you're really looking for a service-oriented hotel I can think of half a dozen that will do you better than the Ritz Carlton Central Park.",Vancouer,"Brokenheartsurgeon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouer</strong>",35,2.0

We arrived at about 9 pm but this was not a problem for the hotel at all, we were shown our room by a manager - Ender who over the week was absolutely amazing, pleasant, and so polite, which really made our week's holiday very special. Each member of staff were obviously informed that it was our 5th wedding anniversary and they each said to us ""Happy Anniversary"" again which made it very special.The room we had was a 1 room city view suite, which had a lounge with sofa, writing table and tv with honour bar. There was a separate toilet and shower area. I had ordered a shower chair which was provided, saving me the stree of having to request it again. The bedroom had a King size which was lovely and spacious and tv and chair, there was a bathroom off the bedroom which was spacious and had a bath, double sink and toilet. In the suite we had there was no roll-in shower it had a step the room you want is 301, which has a roll-in shower, even though I requested it back in January when I booked it , it was not available when we arrived, which did cause trouble for me as an amputee I had trouble going over the step and then closing the door, because the step was quite tall and there was not any room to close the door because we had to push the door into the shower instead of the usual way of outwards. However we worked it out, but it was difficult.The bar area (Star Lounge) was beautiful and the barman Norman was a character. The bar was marble and wood and you could sit at the bar or in the lounge area on leather couches, very relsxing.We paid for Club access which was great - a separate room for the Club where you could have drinks, food and use the internet up to 11pm which was good. I would recommend anyone paying for the Club Access, it was a great place to go and even though you pay for the privilege of using the club you don't pay for the food or drink, which does save you money if you use it all the time.We used the spa La Prairie, this was lovely, an area to change then sit with either herb drinks or champagne etc. We both had facials and I had a a pedicure and manicure, the range of colours weren't brilliant but I did find one that I liked, so that was ok. It was also very accessible for disabled people even in wheelchairs.I would also have to say that ALL the staff that we dealt with were fantastic, polite, informative, helpful and any requests that we had were dealt with pretty much straight away. The Club managed to get us into 2 very good Itlaian restaurants that are usually very full, so they are there for getting you into places with big lists!!It is situated perfectly on Central Park south and you are within easy reach to 5th Avenue and Broadway.I believe there is a house car but not useful for a person in a wheelchair as it is a very tall vehicle, but that is not a problem as they can organise a private car for you or they can order a limo or Sedan if you want something special!I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants luxury in New York!","Derbyshire, UK","KipperWheels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Derbyshire, UK</strong>",25,5.0

The room itself was stunning, beautifully presented and above all, sizeable.On one particular evening, we arranged with the hotel to go to a theatre show and dinner before-hand. The concierge arranged everything - including recommending a high quality and convenient option for our meal and arranging tickets for our chosen show, Jersey Boys. On our return to the hotel room, we entered to find the soundtrack playing in the bedroom with a personalised note explaining that they had given us a copy of the soundtrack to keep for the future. Great service!Although in reality an expensive option if you are a frequent traveller to NYC, the one-off weekend away or get-together is perfectly served by this stunning and welcoming hotel. There are few hotels that aim for a personal experience such as this, and even fewer that achieve it.

I've stayed in many hotels in Manhattan since 1975 and most have had disappointingly small rooms, some were uncomfortable, most were rather noisy, and others had rather dull decor and dull bathrooms. This time, admittedly for a huge price (but a significantly reduced one at that), we had a very large room with fabulous, traditional English furnishings, in wood and silk, that was immensely comfortable. We had a very nice view of Central Park out of two sets of window from the 11th floor. Soundproofing was sublime and the busy world of Central Park South was reduced to less than a murmur from within our room and the hotel overall. The bathroom was generally very good, clad in lovely grey and white marble, and with a delightful separate toilet room with its own door, and would receive a grade A except that the bath was too short -- it was beautifully deep, but about 1 to 2 feet too short for me to be able to stretch out in it. This design was obviously in order to leave room for a nice large shower cabinet (which was just superb, I must say). Dining was generally very good although I didn't like the way they served us sprouts as a side dish with hidden bacon bits which neither of us eat. Service was generally outstanding throughout the hotel, and nothing required more than one phone call to get something which usually arrived pretty promptly thereafter. The concierge was extremely helpful and responsive, and obtained flowers for our arrival and also for presentation to my wife at our celebration dinner. The front desk upgraded us the instant we checked in. These were lovely bonuses that have great value. The final bill for the stay was moderately gigantic, but I'd been expecting it and had braced myself beforehand for the immense cost. But it was worth it and RC definitely helped make it memorable. If I have a few thousand spare dollars lying around in the future, I'll do another mini-honeymoon trip like this and stay at RC again!","McLean, VA","JSACKS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McLean, VA</strong>",89,5.0

Whoever the ""normal"" guest is there, it is one who has a lot of disposable income. For instance, I ordered a soup and beer from room service one night, at a jaw dropping $24. Then $6 was added as a ""delivery charge"". Then 18% service charge and tax. Then I tipped $2. So, I paid almost $40 for beer and soup!! There is no coffee available in the rooms (only bottled water is free) and continental breakfast with coffee tops $50. So, we went to the deli around the corner...$18 for 4 coffees and breakfast sandwiches, versus $200 at the Ritz. A small bag of Kettle Chips there was $7! Internet in the room was a whopping $14.95 a night.The hotel and rooms also didn't compare at all against the Ritz in Shenzhen, were I can afford to stay for special occasions since its just under $200 a night. So, you are really paying for the location and the ""historical"" quality. A standard room at the Ritz in Shenzhen looks out over the city, is 8 times the size, has Nespresso machines and lots of free snacks, nicer room accouterments, bigger bed, is quiet, and plenty of toiletries. In comparison, our room in New York faced other rooms and a water tower, is small, is bare bones without even toothbrushes (I'm sure they would bring them, but still), and has a lot of noise from other rooms and the hall. So, you are really paying 80% of the room cost for staying next to Central Park. Personally, I'm in my twenties, like to shop down in Soho and eat in the West or East village, so a room at one of the Tablet Hotels like Gild Hall or 60 Thompson is 1/4 to 1/3 the cost of the Ritz, the rooms and amenities are much nicer, and the location is ""hip"". Anyway, for certain people, the Ritz is going to be the perfect hotel for you (I think a lot of the guests must get discounts through their work or are just really, really wealthy). Its a great location to get to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and old school restaurants. If you are saving up your money for a once-in-a-lifetime luxury hotel stay, I think you would be gravely disappointed. If you're a techie, or want a modern or ""young"" experience, this hotel is definitely not for you (its like the W hotel's great-uncle). Finally, the TV didn't work well...some channels didn't appear, some didn't have sound, some had the sound out of synch.

It was so luxurious and just the best place to stay to celebrate a special occasion. First, the service was AMAZING!!!! From the moment we drove up to the front of the hotel, located directly across from Central Park, we were treated like royalty. They asked our names and the reason for our stay and of course we told them we were celebrating a birthday. When we walked into the hotel and were approaching the front desk, the people at the front desk said, Hello Mr. and Mrs. Shuck and Happy Birthday Mrs. Shuck. It was really neat that they had transferred the info so quickly. The concierge arranged for us to travel to dinner in the hotel town car and got us the best Handsome Cab (Carriage Driver). When we returned from our outing the hotel had sent Godiva Chocolate covered strawberries to our room...Amazing. The room was beautiful from the linens, to the woodworking, to the view overlooking Central Park. No doubt, we will be back!",New Jersey,"bridetobe22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",1,5.0

The room was beautiful, absolutely spotless and really spacious, gorgeous comfy bed, just perfect! we honestly can't rate this hotel enough it's just magical we had the most perfect stay! Our only complaint would be that this hotel spoils you so much that no other hotel could ever compare! just amazing!",ENGLAND,"WE-HEART-NYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ENGLAND</strong>",0,5.0

The hotel is fabulous, as previous reviews have stated. What stood out for me during this visit was the hotel staff - we stayed during the week that the UN General Assembly was in session. The hotel was extremely busy, as the Nigerian delegation was staying here. The lobby was packed, people all over, limos double parked, yes, somewhat chaotic, but the hotel staff had their act together. Cool, calm and collected. Professional and discreet. The registration desk treated us like we were the only ones in the lobby. The concierge did a phenomenal job assisting me in securing dinner reservations at a fabulous restaurant where reservations are extremely hard to obtain. The staff was truly focused on ensuring that we have a pleasant stay and they definitely succeeded. We will be back!","Verona,NJ","KittyKatKakes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Verona,NJ</strong>",27,5.0
