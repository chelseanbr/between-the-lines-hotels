We were due to stay 5 but unfortunately coronavirus ban hit and had to go home early! Hotel was perfect! We each booked a double room which meant we had plenty of room! Rooms were spotless and cleaned daily! Beds were so comfy!! Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful! Always had a smile for us!!! Location is ideal, just around the corner from the flatiron building! Great bars nearby including the 40/40 club which Beyonce owns! Class spot. Another nice spot is the rooftop bar around the corner from hotel!!! Will definitely stay again!!!!",,Relax574375,1,5.0

Again, I stayed at the Heritage Hotel. I have been in the Hotel/Casino business here in Las Vegas for a very, very long time. I like the Heritage for two reasons.1 – The location is so good. If you go out the front door and to the right and at the end of the street you are at the famous Flatiron building area. A very interesting building and there is a park and restaurants and stores all around. And tables and chairs to sit and enjoy the view. BTW turn around and look above the buildings and you will see the iconic Empire State building reaching out to the heavens. You can walk east over to Park Ave and get the subway and go downtown to Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty or go uptown to Grand Central. Both amazing places to visit.Go out the door to the left and down to 6th Ave and the great shopping stores. Or walk over to 7th Ave and visit Chelsea, an ever changing area. You can take the subway at 7th and go downtown to Greenwich Village. Or go uptown to Central Park, right in the center of the city.2 – The Hotel and it’s staff. Manager, Zahid Rehman, is always around and his staff all do their job well. Front Desk people are polite and helpful. I see them every day helping people, from all over the world, find what they’re looking for in this great city. The maids were good. Took good care of my room every day. Maintenance guys were great. I started each day by going down to the breakfast area. So nicely done and had everything I wanted. I would start off with a cup of very good coffee and use the Wi-Fi to check the weather for the day.I am 82 years of age now and if I visit New York again, this is where I will stay.","Las Vegas, Nevada","WaltersLV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",97,5.0

Much nicer than anything on the block, though most of the block is in scaffolding as is THE WHOLE CITY.I found the staff very nice and spent some time having really nice conversations with some front desk people. The room was in fact pretty big. It was room 608. Pretty clean except for the bathroom which has different colored hairs to great me on the towels. I'm bald, so the hairs were not mine. I could live with that. There were 2 (and not 1) elevators. Between both, you didn't have to wait too long. They were slow, but are 100 years old. It is what it is. Bed was very comfortable and the heating was indeed a little noisy, but worked well. Breakfast:First of all, most of the travellers are from Europe. t's important to wake up in a good mood. There should be NO TV ON and particularly not with news. No one is interested. This also applies to the lobby, which could use an update. The breakfast room is indeed often full. The coffee is undrinkable. Much too weak especially for your European customers. PAPER PLATES AND FORKS, KNIVES AND SPOONS, are1. of the cheapest quality and will not even cut through scrambled eggs or frozen butter.2. really bad for the environment. Get some silverware guys and a dishwasher!The chairs are also way to big for the tables, so if you get a seat, you can't move around. They don't make a good combination. Lose the chairs! The breakfast is a good but failed attempt. Basically everything is filled with sugar.The waffle maker is great, but it's not a matter of if you're going to burn yourself but WHEN as the waffles when ready stick and the man wearing the net and gloves though polite, is far from helpful. Both the eggs and the sausage substance are inedible also. I suggest (as in most cheap European hotels) forget the hot stuff and just have a bowl with fruit salad, several meats and cheeses and your done. If you're going to make an attempt at an American breakfast, you're falling short. All in all an average stay. I paid $76 a night in January for a roomy single room, so I don't know where the prices come from in various reviews.Mixed feelings, but all in all, ok and good value for money at $76 a night. That is about what it was worth.",,David R,2,3.0

I know what to expect in a budget NYC hotel. The elevators are small and slow, the room is small and the view is of the building next door, but that is to be expected. What makes this go from average to poor are three things that should have been better:>> the beds are not attached to the headboard so if you want to sit up in bed and read, the bed slowly rolls away from the headboard and you need to get up and shove it back in. Rinse, repeat.>> the wifi is terrible. I'm trying to write some work emails and the wifi kicks me off about every 60-90 seconds. Oddly, it's staying on long enough to let me write this :-)>> The TV has digital reception which pixellates and lags a couple of times during a movie.I'm not asking for luxury, just basic modern services to work well.",,LauraRu3547,0,2.0

I was at the famous Sands Casino, The home of Sinatra, Martin, Davis and so many others. These guys and so many more worked for us many times. It was when Las Vegas was growing up and becoming known around the world. It happened because we treated people right. Great hotels and the best entertainment in the world.. I turned 82 this year and still feel good when I see a hotel as well run as this place. Location: It’s on west 25 and right off 5th ave. You go out the hotel door and to the right and at the end of the block is the Flatiron Building in full sight. A beautiful sight. Madison Square park and lots of restaurants all around. The 23st subway is right there to take you uptown or downtown. Out the hotel door and to the left and down to 6th ave. Again, lots of restaurants and shops. Walk a bit down 6th and you will come across some of the best shopping anywhere. This is where I shop. At 23rd is the subway and if you know how to use it then you can go anywhere in the city.I like to walk 23rd west over to 7th and 8th. The Chelsea area. Boy, is it going through a change. Old buildings being converted into multi-million dollar apartments. Continue walking over to the river and you are at Chelsea Piers and all that’s happening there.

Would have had to live out of the suit case, but after putting them on the bed. The picture shown is nothing like the rooms themselves. The room in the photo has been doctored for advertising only. Next morning complained bitterly about the terrible room that we had been allocated. They agreed to book us out of that room and book us into a new room, which turned out to be the room next door. At this stage they had used our new credit card twice so what ever their objection later was it was obvious it was a scam. Every morning we heard the people complaining bitterly about this small room and demanding a change. This is how they tried to scam us returned to our room on the 7 August to find that we had been locked out, they had confiscated our clothes, passports, monies and papers which they would not return to us. They demanded that we repay for the room on our new Credit Card as this was different from our initial payment. They said that they would then reimburse our initial payments to our old Credit Card even though we told them we no longer had this Credit Card. What would be our chances of retrieving this payment when we had left America the following day PROBABLY NONE I am 80 years of age and my wife is 74 she was very upset and reduced to tears as it was very embarrassing with other people in the lobby thinking we could not pay our bill, one lady offered to help us out financially. After a long heated debate we demanded that they fetch the police to sort it out, a few minutes latter they gave us back the key for the room. The obviously thought that they could take advantage of an elderly couple. I give this Hotel the BIG DO NOT USE IT which I would have said regardless of them trying to scam us.

To their credit, when we spoke to them, they were happy to show us, an alternative room, which actually looked like a room from their promotional pictures, we had a view of the Empire State building, as well, though the bathroom was a bit cramped. The hotel location is great, 20 minutes from Empire State, 30 minutes to Times Square, but why bother, there is also a number of different restaurants located near by. There are two small lifts, which give you access to the floors, but narrow winding staircase, if you have to walk up, these give away the age of the hotel. Breakfast is buffet style, but be aware, it gets very busy, room is limited, and as with America everything is done to make life easy, plastic plates, knifes and forks, all throw away, have they not heard of dishwashers.We stayed 4 nights, bed was combatable, room was tided each day, shower and the shallowest bath I had ever seen, required you to think a head, no turning on the water and expecting it to be hot straight away, but it came, just took a while.

They are renovating and our bathroom was new and spotless. The room's floor was new plank tiles, which we loved as an alternative to carpet, just feels cleaner! Staff were all very friendly and helpful; the blanket on one of the beds appeared soiled, may have been washed but we couldn't tell. Five minutes after calling the front desk, a fresh blanket was delivered to the room. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, although I think they were full size, not queens. A tall or large person should double check. The room and bathroom were very small and there was no view, but that's what you get in Manhattan, so not a negative. The free breakfast was pretty low end but the coffee was decent, which made a huge difference. The chairs in the breakfast room need to be swapped because an average person's chin was just a few inches above the table, but hopefully better chairs are in the renovation plans. Our ONLY legit complaint was that the room had no place to HANG anything! No closet, no hanger bar, not even a door or wall hook. It rained off and on the whole time were were there and three people had to really scramble to find places to lay wet clothes - we draped them over the shower door, from door knobs, over the tv and desk chair, etc. One thing to know if you stay, you have to watch for the elevator to arrive at your floor because it does not have an alert sound, and you have to open the door to it. If you don't notice it arriving and fail to open the door in time, it will leave without you. If you like this location and can get a good rate, stay here for the cleanliness and comfortable beds. Hopefully as renovation progresses they will provide a place to hang clothes!",,Curiosity44044,0,3.0

When we arrived at the hotel we weren’t carrying the debit card that had made that payment (it had expired a few months previously). We were told we would have to pay again, and then receive a refund. That seemed very odd to me as the room was literally bought and paid for - if the hotel wanted a new card on file, we offered one to swipe. They were intransigent though. When I asked to see the manager, I was refused on the basis that he would say the same - it’s policy. When I asked whose policy, because it was unclear, the hotel or booking.com, the lady on reception said she had had enough of this and stormed off in to the office and handed us over to a colleague. Just unbelievably rude. World class rude in fact. Welcome to New York.We decided we just needed to pay - again - and wait for the refund. Incredibly annoying, but we could see no alternative. I handed over my credit card and the payment was taken. The new receptionist then processed the refund on to the original card, not the credit card! Without telling us she was doing this!! Aaaaaagh.Genuinely awful customer service - an inability to deal with a simple issue in a way that is in any way positive for the customer. I am still shocked by how rude the staff on reception are at this hotel.The hotel itself is very tired. Paint and plaster is chipped on every wall. There was even some graffiti on the window frame. The windows are so filthy you can barely see out of them. It needs millions spending on it to bring itself up to any kind of acceptable standard.

The staff are great and always helpful. The rooms are spacious for New York but I did have a family room with two bedrooms so for a family it was perfect and a small bathroom - perfectly acceptable for a weeks holiday! The beds are so comfortable I work up everyday refreshed. The hotel is a little dated in some areas but I can see that they are trying to update as they go forward. The lifts really aren't as slow as what everyone else is making out - if you get caught at rush hour or breakfast it does stop a lot but that is the same in any hotel!! The breakfast is the same every day, but the waffle maker was our saviour - kids loved it! The hotel could do with two though as you did sometimes have to queue for this but no more than 5 mins! It would be really nice though not to have plastic plates, cutlery and cups to eat breakfast with as its such a waste and surely it's more cost effective and less waste for the environment to use reusable crockery and cutlery! A bit more washing up but a good dishwasher would be better than all that waste!!! Did have an IPhone charger/wire disappear, they left the English plug though so keep an eye on your belongings - this is not the first missing item I have read about. The hotel was also very close to the metro - literally round the corner and the infamous FlatIron building was also just around the corner. The heating is great when it's on - we left it off when out but as soon as we turned it on, the room was boiling in a a matter of 10 minutes - so no stress, yes it's a little loud but no big deal as we didn't leave it on during the night. A great little hotel. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to another family especially a family of five - it's very difficult to find hotels that can accommodate us so a real pleasure.",England,"madmicks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England</strong>",22,4.0

It was FREEZING!If you're coming from JFK it's better to get the Airtrain and then use the LIRR to Penn Station - think it costs around $15 ish in total but it gets you there in the fastest way possible and without the hassle of having to swap trains on the tube. From Penn Station it's around a 10 minute walk. Easily done.Check in was swift, the girls behind the desk were lovely and chatty. The reception area also has unlimited free coffee throughout the day, always a bonus. Theres also an ATM, drinks machine and a tiny gym. Not bad at all.We were on the 11th floor though the view is nothing spectacular - what is spectacular is the ridiculous time it takes the elevator to climb 11 floors. Slowest one i've ever been in in my life! The rooms themselves are of average size, but comfortable for two people - coffee facilities, iron, TV (with actually some good channels on!), small bathroom but with decent shower. All very standard but clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. The walls are thin and so if you're a light sleeper you can hear people coming and going, particularly because the rooms are so close together. The doors also tend to slam shut rather than close gently so early risers tend to wake you up as they leave.Breakfast was included which was downstairs just off reception - the standard offering was on display, eggs, sausages, cereal, pastries etc - the sausages in particular were very nice. Not the worst, not the best but not bad to start your day. The room is reasonably sized too so it's never too cramped.Overall a lovely stay and i'd have no hesitation returning to Heritage if I was in NYC again.A few extras:- You can store your bag(s) for $1 per bag - I'm surprised this is the first time I've come across a charge but its perfectly acceptable, particularly because its done properly in a locked room and with a ticket system so you're bag is secure.- I didn't try the Chinese takeaway next door but the '2Bros' at the end of the street has excellent pizza when you roll in after a few drinks.- The Flat Iron building is literally around the corner - turn right out of the hotel and right at the end of the street and you can't miss it.- You can walk to either end of Manhattan in around 45-60 minutes. - if you can arrange it it's worth doing the day trip to Washington DC - takes around 3-4hrs each way on a coach but the tour guide is full of info and DC itself is a gem.

I have stayed at hotels all across the world, and this is the absolute worst by far. Within 5 minutes of sitting in the room, we saw a mouse run across. We called management immediately, who sent someone up to check into it. They acted very non chalant as if this was very routine call for them to get. I have looked at other reviews which also mentions rodents being found in the room - you can waste your time digging through those reviews or just stop reading this now and book ANYWHERE else. Person at the front desk joked and said maybe the mouse was on the luggage...In fact this is the attitude of everyone there...Deny Deny Deny...They know they have many issues and fail to acknowledge any of them. We asked to be switched into another room, which they managed to do. The toilet overflowed upon first use with poop all over the floor. Again we called and same person came up with same attitude as if this is very routine business. My wife used the bathroom and the toilet paper holder fell onto her foot and cut it. The wifi in the room was nearly non existent, very bad connection. The breakfast was empty, we had to tell them to take the food out of the kitchen and actually put it out so people can eat it. We witnessed someone trip and fall due to the breakfast floor being wet, they were in extreme pain....floor should have been dried off if staff were actually paying attention to the breakfast area. I tried to get in touch with the manager the same night, and manager was not available. I then tried to get in touch for the next 3 days and left messages for manager to call me back...Never got called back. Final message we left was call back by 5pm before we take this up with our credit card company and leave a negative review on trip advisor. We later got a call from the manager (who we were told previously was not available that day). Manager told us he could give us 10% back, a complete joke for ruining our trip to new york city. He stated that we had left a negative review on trip advisor already, which was not true. I got on trip advisor and found that someone else also found a mouse in their room the same time I was staying there, he must have thought that was me!! I tried to get info for the hotel owner, but the general manager and all staff would not give that info. This is the first negative review I have left on trip advisor and I have stayed in many hotels across the world. I am a level headed humble physician with average expectations, and when I say ""stay away"" please trust me. Me and my wife were lied to by staff and the general manager several times in trying to resolve this matter. I have plenty of money and can drop thousands on hotels. I booked this hotel at the last minute and it was the only one nearby which was available. Offering me 10% off is insulting for such negligence, mismanagement, deception, and lies. I used to live in new york city for several years and am appalled by this behavior. Owner of the hotel if you are reading this, share your contact info and me, my wife, and our friends will give you full details of our visit. This is info I would want to know if it were my hotel, so I could correct it. I got out of this hotel as soon as possible and booked at the Wyndham Tryp hotel which was a great experience, typical of many hotels in NYC.","Lady Lake, Florida","PeaceForAll9262</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lady Lake, Florida</strong>",3,1.0

I spend a week at the Heritage hotel. I was very pleased. I have been staying at this hotel for many times. Many years ago I was in the Hotel & Casino business here in Las Vegas. So I know when a hotel is well run and this place is. The front desk people are very helpful. Answered all my questions and got whatever I needed. The room was well set up, very clean and everything worked. The bed was just right for me. There is WiFi in the room and throughout the hotel. Each morning I go down for the breakfast that is well presented and has a nice selection. I use the WiFi to check the weather and see what I should wear that day.The hotel location is a plus for me. Out the door and to the right and you are at the famous Flatiron building area. Lots of interesting things to do and many places to eat. Madison Square Park and Shake Shack are right there. At 23rd and Lexington is a subway to take you up or downtown. Out the door and to the left and you are at 6th ave. And another subway entrance. Or walk 23rd over to the Chelsea area. An area going through a transformation. So, from this hotel I can quickly get anywhere in NY.The hotel manager, Zahid Rehman is always around, he knows this hotel inside and out. I appreciate how well he runs this place. His selection of staff is excellent. I turned 80 years old this trip and if I can make here again, this is where I will stay.","Las Vegas, Nevada","WaltersLV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",97,5.0

There are several subway stations a short walk away, and the view of the Empire State Building was a bonus. However, as we had booked for Springtime, prices per room per night had rocketed and therefore we had expected something more than basic. But it was very basic. The wifi signal was appalling which made planning our week difficult. The hotel staff were mostly pleasant but not particularly helpful when we asked for advice on what we thought would be simple questions e.g. directions. The concierge was rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them to arrange our airport shuttle (which was paid for in advance so they only had to book our time for us) and to store our luggage (which you have to pay for per bag). Breakfast was very samey and not much variety, but there was access to coffee and hot drinks in the lobby 24 hours which was a nice addition.Overall thoughts - we would stay there again but only if the cost was drastically reduced to suit.",,Saff B,1,3.0

The room had a safe, coffee pot, and refrigerator. The hotel was relatively quiet at night. Breakfast is offered downstairs. We decided to go out for breakfast, but I'm guessing it was popular since there was a crowd. This hotel is near several subway lines which makes it very convenient for getting around the city.Cons: Our room had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. There is a shower (no tub), a small sink, and a toilet. There was not enough room to get dressed in the bathroom unless you stand in the shower. Our air conditioner only worked sometimes. The room would get hot and stuffy at night which made it hard to sleep. The internet was spotty. Usually only one person in the room could connect at a time.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a short stay.

The breakfast - I don't know how they do it all with a smile, people, my goodness, take so much food like they're starving and leave so much waste it's embarrassing. Really interesting mix of people from all over the world - unified in gluttony at breakfast :). No attitude in this hotel - everyone is used to walking or taking the subway. This is refreshing - not a touristy kind of ""hail me a cab"" attitude, but a ""How can I find the walking guide for Chelsea"" kind of crew.

There are very few reasonable choices for this neighborhood so we felt lucky to be able to come across the Heritage Hotel for a reasonable rate. The hotel is old but you can see recent updates in the lobby area and in the guest rooms. We were greeted as we entered the hotel and immediately checked into our room. We booked this through a third party (Travelocity) and found it convenient to be pre-paid and in comparing other rates with others, we got a deal. We asked for a king sized bed and found the room to be small - typical of NYC - but functional for one night. I'm not sure if I would stay for a longer period of time. Although it does have a small refrigerator in the room, closet space, coffee maker with supplies, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, and some dresser drawers for clothing to help make your stay more comfortable. In writing this, maybe more than one night wouldn't be a problem! The bathroom was tiny - again, typical NYC - but clean and provided plenty of towels and those little extras that everyone likes to have. The shower was great. We were on the 7th floor and there was still street noise but I'm not sure what could be done about that. We left the heat off for a number of hours but in the middle of night, I found myself cold and the room immediately heated to a comfortable level once I switched it on. The elevators are slow. There are two elevators with one ""hiding"" behind a door. We would press both""down"" buttons and sometimes we would still take the stairs which is great exercise because we didn't want to wait. Breakfast provided the normal breakfast items - eggs, sausage, waffles and plenty of pastries. Hot coffee and tea were available with a variety of juices. Not a bad breakfast to start your busy day in NYC. When we checked out, we asked for our luggage to be stored for the day. It was $1/piece and they led us to the storage room so we could see where our bags would be spending their day. Since we left our bags into the evening, we tipped the concierge generously. She also offered to call transportation for us since it was a very rainy day in the City. We were grateful for that offer.I would stay here again if I needed to be close to the art center of the City. We walked to several sites and it was enjoyable to see different neighborhoods.

One room was perfectly fine, not huge but new york hotel rooms are generally on the small side. However the second room was tiny. there was no room between the two beds, no headboards which made it look like this room originally had one bed and they just added another bed to it.As i said i know new york hotel rooms are not very big but this room should really never have been sold as a quad room. It was not at all suitable for four middle aged women as it felt like we were all sleeping in the same bed they were so close to each other and no storage space at all.We ended up having to pay an extra $300 for a bigger room which was unfair since we had paid the same for both rooms and they were certainly not the same sizeBreakfast was ok, lifts very slow and often a long wait not to mention they only take two people with luggage.Location is good, plenty of places close by to eat.We go to new york every year but wont be choosing this hotel again.

I haven’t felt this way since Gerrard did the slip against Chelsea. First of all there is some crazy woman running around in the breakfasts area, screaming all over the place, and splashing waffles all over the place like she was having a seizure. She was obviously high on some drug and my friends and I found it very disturbing. Furthermore the wifi-connection was the worst I have ever tried. When you connect to the wifi you only stay connected for two minutes. After two minutes the connection disconnects and you have to start all over again. When you finally manage to connect your device to the wifi you can’t even use it because it’s the slowest wifi ever. You can’t use your Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. because the internet is so slow. What’s is worse than all of this is the breakfast. The crazy women is screaming all over the place. The eggs comes out of a plastic bag and is definitely the worst eggs I have ever tasted. But that isn’t the only bad thing about their breakfast. The sausages are disgusting and taste like rubber. There’s only one toaster for the bread so you have to stand in line for 15 minutes. There is only two positive things about Heritage Hotel. The first one being the cleaning of the rooms. The cleaning lady’s does a very good job and they are very polite. The second thing being Two Bro’s pizza. The restaurant is right across the street from the hotel.

Yes it is dated in places and needs an update (when compared to more swankier establishments) However if you take this hotel for what it is - Budget, No frills, solid service, well located, then you cant complain. This hotel is great to lay your head after a solid day of work or sight seeing. It's location is brilliant (right on 5th Ave) and a stones throw from the Flat Iron building and Madison square park (home to the original Shake Shack, which is a must visit) Service is good at the hotel and often nothing is too much trouble, I have requested many things and had them sorted within the hour. Breakfast is a comprehensive self service job, all world foods catered for, great coffee and waffle machine ect. Considering your staying in the very upmarket Chelsea the price is cheap, often people complain but this place is not the four seasons, but it's location makes up for it. If you stay on a weekend the carpark across the road becomes a very cool 'flee market' selling many overpriced 'New York Loft antiques' but you can find a bargain. If your a New York first timer and on a budget or need a good location to get all around New York, then this is a great little hotel to lay your head after a busy day of exploration. Cons - Decor / dated room technology. One thing I will say is, if your not too good on your feet, this is a tall skinny hotel, so if the lifts are in use, be prepared for a long spiral staircase to your rooms.

There was no room to separate them, since the 1st bed allowed just 12 inches of leg room to walk INTO the room, and the other bed was flush against the opposite wall.

I have been here before.I am from Las Vegas where I was in the Hotel/Casino business for many, many years. I was at the famous Sands Casino, The home of Sinatra, Martin, Davis and so many others. These guys and so many more worked for us many times. It was when Las Vegas was growing up and becoming known around the world. It happened because we treated people right. Great hotels and the best entertainment in the world.. I see Heritage Hotels has taken over the ownership and running of this place. Right off, I will say they are doing a good job. I see some new faces but most of the staff are still here. So glad to see Mr. Rehman as General Manager. He knows this hotel inside and out. He knows how to inspire and motivated the staff to do the great job they do. I see him everywhere, checking on things. Reminds me of myself 50 years ago. I turned 79 this week and still feel good when I see a well run place. Some things I like:Location: It’s on west 25 and right off 5th ave. You go out the hotel door and to the right and at the end of the block is the Flatiron Building in full sight. A beautiful sight. Madison Square park and lots of restaurants all around. The 23st subway is right there to take you uptown or downtown. Out the hotel door and to the left and down to 6th ave. Again, lots of restaurants and shops. Walk a bit down 6th and you will come across some of the best shopping anywhere. This is where I shop. At 23rd is the subway and if you know how to use it then you can go anywhere in the city.I like to walk 23rd west over to 7th and 8th. The Chelsea area. Boy, is it going through a change. Old buildings being converted into multi-million dollar apartments. Continue walking over to the river and you are at Chelsea Piers and all that’s happening there. Very exciting time in New York.I applaud Heritage for the way they have started here. My stay was, as usual. Just perfect. Everything worked well. I love the WiFi to check the weather every morning on my iPad and start my day with the very nice Breakfast the hotel serves. It is so well done and free. And the Smart Phone charging outlets in the room are a great idea. I could charge my iPhone, IPad and Nook at one time.My room was well set up and everything I needed was there. Maid service was very good.The Hotel front desk staff were so polite and helpful. My last day, Jesena, at the desk helped me check out and get my Limo. Very nice.So overall I am very pleased. Heritage is doing a good job and I feel this Hotel is in good hands.I am 79 years old and would like to visit New York city later this year.

As a New Yorker, I took off to play tourist. The hotel is directly across the street from the historic Orthodox church that suffered a devastating fire recently. There are construction trucks, barricades and fire trucks on standby. This may turn some people off, but it is a sad reality. It is withing walking distance to the fashion district, Madison Square park and several subways. Free breakfast is included. I only gave it 3 stars because of the staff. They were friendly, but not very knowledgeable. I checked my bag early and clarified my reservation. I asked if it was a non smoking hotel as many are. I was told yes. We went to do our activies and returned later to check in. I overheard the same clerk asking what smoking floor they wanted. When it was my turn I questioned what she told me earlier. She denied saying it was her or she said it. She then said she must have misunderstood me!! She did not recognize me as a rewards member and I am at Platinum. We were giving a higher floor (11th) and although I requested a king bed, the bed was small, the mattress was comfortable however the sheets were stiff and itchy. The bathroom was tiny with a pedestal sink and no counter. What we found most awkward was the location of the toilet paper. It was behind you to the side and the bowl was on top of the wall so it make it an uncomfortable turn. The windows outside were filthy, so you could not see out. The evening clerk directed us to pizza parlors, not restaurants which we clearly asked for. In the morning the breakfast was standard--hot and cold. However some woman was saving at least 4 tables for people, making it difficult to find a seat. Noone said anything. It also has a small fitness center.

It was like sleeping in a jet engine. As if this wasnt bad enough we had to endure steel hotel room and hallway doors being slammed all through the night and early morning as well as a loud party of girls in a room across the hall. The hotel room doors are less than a foot away from eachother across each landing and you hear every word being said in the neighbouring rooms as the rooms are tiny and your bed is very close to the door to the hallway. I accept that NY is noisy but the inside of a hotel is supposed to be quietish at night so you can sleep. Thats why you book hotels. No point in complaining about noisy hotel neighbours to Reception here as the loud neighbours just ignored the too polite telephone request from reception staff to be quiet at 1am.

Then we were directed to a cafeteria to sort out our rooms, we were then told that some rooms were not ready yet so we would have to double up. At this point I thought I would get over it and move on its a small problem. But oh was I wrong, I then dragged my suitcase and hand luggage to one of two elevators, after waiting a good 10 minutes the cranky and extremely small elevator arrived but could only fit a few of us In there. We proceeded to the tenth floor at a pace I can only describe as unbearably slow. I then exited this elevator and carried on to my room which was in a small corridor, when I opened the door my entail reaction was to cry as I was shocked at how little the room looked like the ones on the website it was the tiniest room with only a minuscule, grimy sheet of glass to provide very little natural light into the dark and dismal room. The bathroom a nasty shade of wee yellow, was so cramped I could hardly breath let alone move. The shower would only allow two temperatures, you could either freeze or boil, I chose to boil. So while standing in the shower being boiled by a hose like shower I looked at the towel which could probably only cover the body of a small child. After all of this I was glad to get into bed after a very long flight from England, so I went to close the curtains to find out I couldn't, I could only pull down some crappy blinds that still let light into the room. Then because I couldn't sleep I decided to try to watch some tv, which was positioned I. Such say that only one person would be able to see it but the that didn't matter because it was such poor quality you didn't want to see it. I couldn't even unpack as there was nowhere for me to put my any of my stuff. In the morning I headed down back into the crap elevator to breakfast, I had some apple juice, a muffin, a doughnut, Apple and banana (only fruit available ) the muffin was so dry I actually chocked, my friend had to preform the Heimlich manoeuvre. The apple juice was watery and cheap and the lack of selection applauded me. After surviving a night in hell and going out for the day we came back to the room to find our beds half made and the sheets left for us to do!!!!!!

I found this place because our regular spots were booked up, and was delighted to find that this hotel has an unusual variety of room types, including rooms with three single beds. This was perfect for our little group. The rooms felt like an old-timey NYC hotel. The room and bathroom were fairly small - you couldn't open the bathroom door all the way because it hit the foot of one of the beds. However, there was walking space around all the beds, plenty of counter space (desk and a few night stands), room for small suitcases, and even a microwave, coffee maker and mini fridge. Beds were very comfortable, and the double pillows on the bed, one softer, one harder, were great. Our room was at the end of the hall, and behind fire doors from the elevator, so very quiet in terms of hotel noise. The trash collection after midnight was quite loud, even on the 11th floor. We weren't expecting much noise because the hotel is on a narrow, not-so-busy street, and if it wasn't trash night, that probably would have been true. There were a few things that were worn and tired feeling, like the rusted cover over the tissue box, but all was clean. Wifi was reliable and strong.Front desk staff on both days were incredibly friendly and helpful. The concierge/baggage handler didn't seem to be the most informed one I've ever seen and had to look a bunch of things up, but I imagine if it is your first visit and you are going to the major sites, you could get the help you needed. One guest was asking about getting a cab, and he said just to hail one, so it sounds like they do not provide that service to guests. Hailing a cab can be intimidating, even for someone like me who has been there a bunch of times, and, since the street is small, there aren't a ton of available cabs cruising by the hotel. Breakfast was typical Comfort Inn - a few hot items and enough for everyone to find something to keep them going for a while. I loved that they did not use those horrible styrofoam plates and cups like some Comfort Inns. Unlike other reviewers, I found the breakfast area to be comfortable and neat.","Albany, NY","Librarian1998</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, NY</strong>",49,3.0

I stayed at this hotel. It was a very enjoyable stay. This hotel works for me in many ways.1 – Location – Out the front door and to the right and you are at the Flatiron Building. And all the restaurants. Every year they keep improving this area. Always so clean and safe. The Subway is right there to take you uptown or downtown. Madison Square Park is wonderful and of course Shake Shack is there.Out the door and to the left and you are at 6th avenue and the subway at 23rd . I like to walk west over to the Chelsea area. An ever changing place with nice restaurants and interesting things to see. Sometimes I walk down 7th ave. to the Meatpacking area –right below 14th street and all the new restaurants that are opening there.Speaking of restaurants. I like to walk from the hotel over to east 20th and to Gramercy Tavern. One of the great restaurants in NY. Another, is Balthazar’s down on Spring street. Oh so good.2 – The Hotel – This hotel is so well run. The staff are so well trained. I have been in the Hotel/Casino business in Las Vegas for many, many years and I am impressed with how well they do it here. The Manager, Mr. Rahmen can be proud of the team he has put together here. The Front desk staff, all of them, are so polite and helpful. Handled everything I needed. The Maids are very good and Maintenance guys know what they are doing.Each morning, I would check the weather on my iPad using the WiFi which works so well. I headed down to breakfast. As I go to the evaluator I can smell the coffee. The free breakfast is nicely presented and the selection is just right. I like that they have staff there, who are constantly make sure all the food is fresh and ready. The coffee is especially good.So over all, a great trip to NY for me. This hotel played a big part of that.

Our train arrived at Penn Station at 9:30 am. Our plan was to walk to the hotel and have them hold our bags while we did some touring. When we arrived at the hotel, we were immediately greeted by the desk staff and asked if we were checking in. We were pleasantly surprised that our room was available and we would be able to put our bags in our room and get things situated before leaving for the day. The hotel is fairly centrally located. On Saturday, we walked to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and part of 5th Ave. We attended a basketball game at Madison Square Garden that got done around 11:30pm. We easily and safely walked back to the hotel after the game. Sunday morning the concierge suggested a route to the Metropolitan Museum of Art - walk around the corner, go two blocks and take the R or N subway to 5th Ave and then walk the rest of the way. When at the subway entrance a nice young guy suggested another route which was better and did work out well. This is the first time we have stayed right in the city and we were surprised by how small the rooms were. We had a room with one queen bed that had just enough room to walk on either side, a small stand that holds a mini- refrigerator, a small closet with a mirrored door, a dresser that doubles as a TV stand and small desk and chair. The bathroom is also quite small. The only two negatives of the room and it made the stay less comforting was that there was no heat in the bathroom and the heater in the room noisily cycled on and off throughout the night. The tiled bathroom floor was freezing and very uncomfortable when getting out of the shower and whenever using the bathroom. We tried to leave the door open so heat would get in the room, but when doing so, the door blocked the heater that was in the window. It was easy to hear others come and go and we could hear the TV in the room next door that was left on all night. The breakfast room was clean with the typical Choice Hotel breakfast provided. The food was well-stocked on a busy Sunday morning. Overall, we found the location and staff to be excellent, the price was comparable to others in the area and I think what we got for the money was probably typical for a NYC hotel. If you are in fairly decent shape, you can walk to many attractions from this hotel.","Indian Lake, New York","ADKTraveler12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indian Lake, New York</strong>",39,4.0

Nothing special except, maybe, the nifty old ceilings in the lobby and the sparkly chandeliers in the breakfast room. It has the feeling of having once been a tad more elegant.My daughter and I needed a place to stay in the upper East Side. Not being wealthy, we had to settle for Chelsea, but picked a hotel very close to the #6 subway, which got us to the Upper East Side in less than 15 minutes (including the walk to the subway stop). Did I say ""settle""? In fact, I'm very happy with the location, as it is a block away from Madison Square Park, on the edge of which I stumbled onto Eataly, an amazing food emporium of all things Italian. Not far either from the Flatiron Building or the High Line. Also a great quilt shop and contemporary quilt gallery (City Quilter). Walking the hotel's street (25th) latish at night was a bit spooky -- not many people, but we had no issues.As for the room, it was wonderfully quiet, somewhat small, especially the bathroom, and clean. The beds (two twins) were quite comfortable.My rating for this nifty hotel would have been a 4, but the one complaint we had is the same as for some other guests: the heating is erratic. The electric heater/A/C worked well enough, but the heat didn't quite reach into the bathroom. One suggestion for the hotel's next round of renovations: new windows and/or an additional pane of glass in the windows. The draft from the windows was pretty bad, especially with the cold wind outside. If major renovations are ever in the works, then a new heating system might be in order. Then again, with the price as reasonable as it is, I can put up with the erratic heat; after all, I slept quite well after walking around the Big Apple all day.I would recommend for those who like to travel as we do: cheap, quiet and reasonably comfortable.","Hampton, Connecticut","Ellen E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hampton, Connecticut</strong>",18,3.0

Subway is a good way to get around but the subway system is old. You need to read the signs carefully before entering because different lines (even the same line in opposite directions) at a station are not necessary accessible between them. It is cheaper to get a MetroCard ($1 for the card and $2.50 per ride) than buying single-ride tickets ($2.75 per ride) if you take more than 5 rides. One MetroCard can be shared by multiple people (you just hand it to the next person after you have entered). Listen to announcements carefully because some trains are express and they skip stations. Dinners can be expensive but many restaurants offer deep discounts during lunch time. For example, Grotta Azzurra in Little Italy (177 Mulberry St) offers a pasta and an entree for $9.95 (half-price compared to dinner) and it was delicious.

The NY subway is GREAT (a/c trains,not stations) but NOT with luggage,at $2.50 a ride use it everywhere once you're in. Had to meet family and a party in Hoboken (New Jersey) for the World Cup final (Germany v. Argentina 1-0 in a great game) and the PATH train to NJ (NY subway doesnt go) was 3 blocks away from the hotel! There (and back after) in a flash.By the way, the water from the faucet in NY is delicious! Refilled my water bottle umpteen times. The elevator is tight but being on the 9th floor (room 904) with a view of the Empire State Building it was a good thing after walking miles everyday and night. Breakfast in the mornings was OK to get you off. Lots to eat and drink all around for any budget you please. Pizza by the slice at 2 Brothers down the block for a dollar late at night....nice and cheesy too!The Chelsea Comfort Inn is steps away from Madison Square Park (Shake Shack mmmm burgers and shakes), great people watching and a good place to plan,Eataly is a fun, fine Italian market, produce and food eat-in, Eisenberg's Sandwich spot, Flatiron building, short walk to the superb albeit touristy Hi-Line park....superb landscaping and views. The 40-40 Sports Club (Jay Z and partners) is on the corner 25th/Broadway and a good sports bar. Went to see Derek Jeter and the MLB AllStar game, poor crowd, nonchalant service, but was told the focus is NFL and NBA ....Walk friendly, people nice enough with directions etc, even telling me how best to maximize use of my new camera. Chelsea, considered mid-Manhattan is close via subway to uptown to Central park, all the Museums, Times Square, Harlem and downtown to the FI-Di (Wall ST, 9/11 Memorial recently opened and very worth it). .........take the ferry to Statue Liberty and Ellis Island....eat at Noodletown NY in Chinatown, Ruchi's Indian near 9/11 site, good and half price at lunch...what,yes true and good too...I could go on.....but go there yourself and see why NYC is my new favorite city in the world!!!","Napa Valley, California","Gareth V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Napa Valley, California</strong>",7,1.0

Beds, room and service were great. However because this was a smoking room, carpet felt strange beneath naked feet. The window had little light coming from the tiny courtyard-like space. Front desk service was great when room cards needed reprogramming. Free breakfast consisted of orange and apple juices, coffee and tea, cereal, bread, muffins, Danish, waffle maker.We stayed Wednesday through Sunday. We are non-smokers and stayed in a smoking room due no availability. On Friday evening, we smelled Marijuana in the hallway. Room 206 is surrounded by elevators, so the smell came from the nearby room. On Saturday night and Sunday night we could smell cigarettes. I could not sleep properly due to smell. I tried turning on washroom fan and A/C to full blast but to no avail. I did not know that Me, my wife and my young kids would have to deal with second hand smoke...I blame building for poor circulation-- it's old.The refrigerator in our room did not work. Our room had two twin beds and a small couch (loveseat) that was a pull out but no mattress within. I had registered only 2 of my 3 kids since it's hard to get any hotel that accommodates 2 adult and 3 kids.This booking was a cost saving measure on my part. We made use of the sofa cushions onto floor and made our extra ""bed"". The location is superb for a reasonable price.

It is safe to say all rooms in this hotel are not created equal. I think we got one of the best rooms. We faced the street directly across from a cathedral and we had a view of the Empire State Building just slightly off to the side – very nice. It may have made a difference that we made our reservations early, stayed four nights and are members of the hotel’s frequent quest program. Having the breakfast buffet is a plus because it is NYC and visitors have lots to do. We were able to walk to our Broadway play and nearby restaurants. Subways are very close by as well. We took a taxi from LaGuardia airport but I did see that one can take an airport shuttle. We took one other taxi but then used the subway or walked to where we wanted to go. I used to live in the City so I am somewhat familiar with the subway routes but I think an adventurous person could figure out the subway system.One pleasant surprise was that one well-known food store, Fairway Market, has a location just around the corner from the hotel. It has prepared food in addition to healthy, grocery selections. Note that sometimes it is crowded because I think it is a local favorite. Luckily, right across the street from Fairway is another small store, Sunac fancy food, which also has prepared food and we enjoyed snacks there as well.Another convenience was a nearby dry cleaner, Digital Cleaners on West 26th St. I had one item, I prepaid and they delivered it to the hotel the next day. (I love New York.)Staff was great. Regarding the hotel room I expected “okay” and got “very nice.” Note we did have a door to what could be an adjoining room but we didn't hear any noise until the last day and it wasn't a big deal.

The hotel is in a great central location and is close to the subway so getting around the city is easy. The staff here were great and they went above and beyond to provide excellent service. One day we were trying to buy tickets online for the 911 Memorial and Museum and the computers in the business center happened to be down. The staff went out of their way to process the transaction for us on the hotel computer behind the desk, which they certainly didn't have to do. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There were 6 of us and we had two adjoining rooms and one bathroom. The beds were comfortable and we really didn't hear much street noise at all. We had a great view of the Empire State Building too, which made it extra nice. It's not the fanciest hotel, but they do keep it up and keep it clean. It was just what we needed for a family vacation and we were glad to be able to all stay together in one room. We had a fridge in the room too so that came in handy to keep drinks and snacks cool. The free breakfast was also a nice extra and one of the reasons we chose this hotel in the first place.

The location is between two subway stations and close to both trader joe's and another grocery store for in-room refreshments. TIPS: For wine, I would head to the Chelsea Wine Cellar @ W.21st and 7th. They have a good selection and decent prices. If you plan on using the subway more than 6 times, buy an unlimited 30 day ride car for $30. Check out EATALY.

We arrived at 10:30am and they offered to hold our bags until check in! That was great because we didn't want to be stuck lugging them around all day. The free breakfast was good. They offer cereal, bagels, danishes, eggs, sausage, waffles, coffee, and juices. We definitely took advantage of that. Again, it was nothing fancy, but it was a light, quick meal to start our day until we were ready for lunch. This hotel is located in a good area and close to the subway, which was a nice. The only minor complaint that I has was that the walls were paper thin. We stayed on room 1107 and I could hear what was going on next door. It didn't bother me much since I only heard the other room while we were getting ready for the day, etc. the bathroom was small too. My husband and I couldn't both be in there getting ready at the same time. But again, no big deal! They also had a full length mirror on the closet door which was great.

If you're planning on spending most of your time outside the hotel room, this is a clean, affordable (by NYC standards) and perfectly located place to stay.

Some told us to stay at the less expensive but far nicer hotels in New Jersey and take the train in. Others told us we'd regret the remote location and suck it up and pay midtown Manhattan prices. After much to and fro, we chose the latter. After missing out on a really good deal at the Holiday Inn, we chose the Comfort Inn as our second choice based on decent reviews we read. We can say that everything said about this place is true:PROS: - super convenient location: close to two different subway lines, within walking distance to Times Square and Empire State Buildinbg - free wireless internet (though it was intermittent) - free hot breakfast: we didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised by the choice of food items, plus hot items like scrambled eggs, sausages, and self-made waffles! We're not terribly picky (indeed, we actually enjoy IKEA breakfasts, which are on par with the hotel's)CONS: - tiny tiny rooms: our family of 4 crammed into a small room with two double (!) beds. One person can't even walk by another without having to jump on the bed first. - not much other amenities: don't expect a pool; the fitness room had a couple of treadmills and that's it - efficient but impersonal service. Perhaps I can't fault Comfort Inn for this specifically, as this seems to be the New York way. But we never got a sense that we were welcomed guests. The staffers just looked like they were doing their jobs--no more, no less. Our faulty room safe was attended to promptly, so I have to give kudos for that. - rather expensive given the age and rating of the hotel, but we're told all Manhattan hotels are not cheap - area is slightly on the sketchy side, but not enough to alarm us as we walked around at nightSUMMARYTo us, the pros outweigh the cons. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with 4 stars. With our late night returns, it was nice to be able to take the subway back directly, without having to fear missing the shuttlebus if we stayed in New Jersey.","Vancouver, Canada","Carl L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",24,4.0

The Hotel is situated in a safe and swish neighbourhood-very upwardly mobile. You will not be disappointed by the neighbourhood. But this is a hotel with several problems. The front of the Hotel is undergoing major repairs and redecoration and is covered in scaffolding right now. Other maintenance work is ongoing. Hotel corridors are narrow and poorly ventilated. Another problem-there are only two elevators for an 11 storey hotel. The breakfast is perfectly satisfactory although the dining area could be much cleaner and the quality of service by the employees there is surly in the extreme. The rooms are standard and very functional-nothing special but if you are in NYC, you probably won't be spending too much time in your room. The level of housekeeping and cleaning was excellent. My only major complaint regarding the room was that the upper part of the pane of glass in the bathroom window was cracked and ready to shatter. I didn't dare open it. Would I stay there again? Yes, but only because of the location.

The location could not be any better. 25th Street is very centrally located in Manhattan. You are a few steps from Broadway Street, and just beyond that is a great park that has a Shake Shack in the middle of it. Great food by the way. Also, the subway stop is on 23rd Street, which is only two blocks away. And if you know anything about Manhattan, you have to ride the subway. So, as you can see, location is amazing. As for the room, it was perfect. There were three of us, so we got two double beds. The room is rather small, but also rather big for a hotel room in New York. Beds were comfortable, there was enough space for three carry-on bags and a big checked bag on the floor. There was a flat screen TV, nice bathroom, and over all very clean. The real plus was the complementary breakfast. They had cereal, pastries, muffins, bagels, fruit, and fresh waffles every morning. And it went until 11 am, which is very nice if you were out late the night before. Also, alot of people complaine about the noises from the street at night keep them up. This place is on a very quite street, so you hear almost nothing. So, when you’re thinking about a hotel in Manhattan, remember that you’re most likely going to spend the least amount of time in that room, so you really only need the basics.

The room we had was small and cramped, and the bathroom was minute. We arrived early in the day - around 11, and we told quite curtly that check in was not until 3, and that we needed to store our luggage. I was absolutely appalled that the ""concierge"" was charging $1 per bag for storage AND we had to carry our own bag there, and place it on the shelf. We left for a few hours and came back around 1pm, inquired about our room again, and again was told curtly by the front desk agent that check in was 3 pm - however, that there was 1 room available. Fine - we would take it, since we had appointments in the afternoon that we needed to get ready for. Upon retrieving our bag, again, the ""concierge"" would not get our bag for us - my husband had to do it. Hot water took a while to get to the shower, but the first morning was plentiful, the second morning, the water was tepid at best. Water pressure was okay. The condition of the room was questionable - distinct divets in the floor, that when you walked on it, you would literally sink about an inch into the floor, carpet was old and dirty, windows need to be cleaned. Needing to plug in my laptop to charge, the only available and accessible outlet was in the bathroom. We had to move the coffee maker to the bathroom just to use it. Housekeeping was questionable, as at 330 pm on our 2nd day, my husband called to inquire about housekeeping for our room, and was advised that ""someone would be there between now and 6pm"". No apologies from the front desk about the delay in service. Breakfast was okay - the usual bulk bakery items, microwave sausages, and instant scrambled eggs. We asked one of the concierges for directions to WTC from the hotel - and I was mortified that she didn't know the address of the hotel in which she works (had to look it up on her phone) - and again, charges $1 per bag storage - clearly this alone needs to be posted somewhere. When we checked out, not one question of ""how was your stay?"" or ""Is there anything we can do to improve our hotel?"" The desk clerk - same one who checked us in earlier - just didn't really seem concerned. Ugg...

The only problem we encountered was the banging of doors when people entered and left their rooms in the late night and early morning hours.

I litterally had to step over them and move the vacuum.I winded my way to Room 705 which was in the back of the hotel which was quiet, thankfully. Two double beds in a very small room and a regular bathroom. The trouble started when I tried to take a shower. NO HOT WATER. I was in a hurry to meet people for dinner, so hurriedly took a wash cloth but informed the front desk that the hot water did not work in my room. The woman at the front desk replied to my concern with “No one else has complained.”! Are you kidding me? I told them I couldn’t go with the maintenance person at that time, but would check with them when I returned. When I returned, I used my key card and it didn’t work, so down the steps I go to the front desk. They gave me a new key card and told me that my hot water problem was fixed. Back up to the room I go, start the shower, get ready and low and behold, NO HOT WATER. The only thing hot in that room was me!!!! I called the front desk and they sent some up, and long story short, I moved to another room directly next door. But this time, I knew I would only be staying one night. I checked out of the Comfort Inn Chelsea that next morning and went back to the W Hotel Union Square! This is what I get for trying to save a little bit of cash.If you don’t mind1) Slow and non-working elevators2) No hot water, or a chance of3) Rude check in and checkout people4) Your concerns not being met5) No wireless working (and you must pay when it does work) Then definitely stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is conveniently located on 25th Street right off of Broadway, and the N Q and R Uptown and downtown trains are a block or 2 away which is nice. This is probably the only thing that is going for this hotel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","klocco1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",90,1.0

I had been sent to NYC on a business trip, and my wife came along and we stayed an extra night on our own dime. We didn't want to spend $600 or more to spend another night at the New York Palace, so I searched for a low price alternative in a decent neighborhood.I guess you kinda get what you pay for sometimes. I've bargain hunted for hotels in NYC before and been happy with the results, but not so much this time. The hotel is small and everything about it is small. Tiny check in area, tiny (and slow) elevators and REALLY TINY rooms. We had a King room, and after the bed was put in it, there was room for little else. There's a TINY closet, a TINY bathroom with barely room for one person, a tiny desk and a small (but much appreciated) refrigerator...although it turned out the frig didn't cool very well. We left a couple of sodas in it, and after an entire afternoon and evening, they were barely coolish. The room is cooled by a window unit, which did a fair job on a super hot day...but was typically slightly noisy. We had no view (not surprising)...just the fire escape of the rundown building next door.I'm okay with a small room in a good location. We spent little time in the room. But this was the smallest we've ever had and it made everything was just a little run down too...so the whole thing just felt a little dirty and seedy. Yes, it has the Comfort Inn brand, but it didn't rise to even those normal levels of cheap but clean. The folks at the front desk were very friendly, and they actually had a tiny concierge desk with a nice young Eastern European lady working there. She helped us with a subway map, but we had no other chance to test her knowledge.The location was pretty good, though. It is on 25th street, near the corner of Broadway. If you walk to that corner and look south, two blocks away, view unimpeded, is the terrific Flatiron Building. Madison Square Park is also in site, so that was very nice. The park is lovely, and on this hot day, many New Yorkers were just laying on the grass soaking up the rays and letting their kids run around and have fun. Very nice. Just three or four buildings down from the hotel on 25th are several giant antique stores, including an intriguing antique mall that we spent a fair amount of time in. That was an unexpected treat. We strolled west down 23rd and passed lots of great restaurants, fun little shops and eventually arrived in the heart of Chelsea and the Hiliner park. It's about a 20 minute stroll each way from hotel to hiliner, but it's worth it. A less busy section of NYC,with some real architectural charm. Also, there is a subway station VERY near the hotel steps.SO, to be fair, the hotel was (relatively) cheap...and if money is a bigger worry than quality or cleanliness...you're probably okay here. I'd love to stay at this location of NYC again...just not at this hotel, I'm afraid.","Albuquerque, New Mexico","RMurray847</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>",148,3.0

Breakfast offerings were the usual fare at such places: hardboiled eggs, bagels, waffles, cold cereals, coffee and tea, etc. The coffee was actually pretty good. Staff were friendly and responsive. When I reported that a smoke detector was beeping in the hallway outside my room, the staff changed the battery right away.The Comfort Inn Chelsea is a few blocks away from Fashion Ave., Union Square, Gramercy Park, and the Flatiron Building, and just off Madison Square Park.

I tend to scour the internet for the best room for the best price when making vacation plans. Almost every hotel in Manhattan charged over $200 (closer to $300-900) per night, and the ones that did not were either in questionable/inconvenient locations or involved shared bathrooms/accommodations. What's more, when I cross-referenced available hotels with reviews on various sites, the $300+/night hotels received complaints about bed bugs and dirtiness. (And I am not going to pay $300+ for bed bugs!) When I found the Comfort Inn Chelsea, I was sold--rooms for way under $200/night in a great location and CLEAN. (Note: if you're looking for a place with a spa, incense, fireplaces or floral arrangements in the rooms, this is not the place for you.) The rooms are standard, cozy (read: small by non-NY standards) but perfect if you just want a safe, comfortable home base while exploring the city. The bed was incredibly comfy (even comfier that those at a certain 4-star hotel in LA where you can buy their ""signature"" bed). The basic complimentary breakfast is just icing on the cake. The service at the front desk is attentive, friendly, and helpful. They even helped me with a random request to use their shredder (work-related). As for location, this hotel is in the Flatiron District (a few blocks from the Flatiron Building). Jay Z's 40-40 club is down the block and there is a beautiful church across the street. There was a weekend market in the church parking lot with antiques and vintage items to peruse through and a 24-hour CVS right down the block. You can walk or catch a quick cab ride to the Village, Soho, Midtown, Grand Central Station and/or Times Square.

So to expect an extravagantly sized hotel room in Manhattan - especially at an affordable price - is an extremely tall and rather unrealistic order. That being said, I stayed at the Comfort Inn Chelsea recently with a friend. This hotel has a great location - right in the heart of Chelsea. Very walkable to many points of interest. It was an unexpected treat that there were several regular weekend flea markets that are held within walking distance of the hotel. I found it a plus that the hotel was located on a block of 25th St. that was not too noisy. Despite that, I felt safe walking around the hotel in the wee hours of the night / morning. Anyway, the building is old, strikes me as pre-war era but appears to be decently maintained. The lobby is rather small but the hotel makes up for that with their friendly staff. They have a business center on the 1st floor as well which offer internet access. Admittedly, the hotel rooms are on the smaller side. However, they were clean and well maintained. We were able to find a room with 2 beds for approximately $160 for a Saturday evening in NYC - a deal which is simply hard to beat in midtown Manhattan. The bathroom was pretty modern though the bedroom decor seemed to be a bit dated. They did not have a flat screen in the room, rather an older television set with cable. I do have to reiterate that these are all minor details compared to the fact that the room was CLEAN. Especially in a place like NYC where there is so much to see and so much to do, you'll likely just need a place where you can lay your head down at night.I would recommend this hotel to friends any day.

For those that like to walk, its not far to several attactions, but far enough that if you don't like to walk, you will need to learn the subway/bus routes. There is a good chinese restaurant that is adjacent and a number of other good restaurants within a few blocks, but I typically find myself several blocks away for dinner. For breakfast, they offer a typical continental breakfast with cereal, fruit, breads, juices, etc. There is only 1 ice machine and it is in the lobby. If you buy drinks and want ice to go with them, just ask the lobby staff for a bag on your way back to your room and they will give you one for your ice (so you don't need to go up to your room to get it).The hotel has 2 elevators, one of which is small, and can be busy in the morning, I have used the stairs but these are narrow and windy so best to plan extra time.

The really great surprise was its staff and service. My sister is disabled and so we needed a hotel that had a ramp for the hotel entrance. But prior to the trip she had taken a downturn so she also needed to be able to use a scooter in the room itself. We live in different cities so I didn't even realize until we arrived together at the hotel what a problem that was going to be. The rooms at the Comfort Inn are average for New York, which means they are perfectly fine for one or two people, but not for maneuvering around in a scooter. When I realized the room I had booked wouldn't work I just kind of fell apart, I assumed the whole trip was going to be a disaster. But the Comfort Inn staff turned that all arround. They managed to upgrade us into a suite and, while that itself was a complete shock, what was even more amazing is that they made the change and moved our luggage, and put up with all our trouble, with incredible cheerfullness and good humor which continued, unabated, through the entire four nights of our stay. They always had time to give us directions and information and help in or out of the hotel. It was like staying with family. I should point out that the hotel does NOT advertise itself as accessible, it was my mistake to assume that my sister would only require a ramp (when she really required an accessible room as well).

My relatives stopped by before we went out, and they live on a noisy NYC street. They made the claim that they couldn't sleep in our room because it was too quiet!I used frequent stay points for 3 nights for Halloween and the NYC Marathon, and I was given the top floor (11th floor) in the back (quieter than street noise). The room is bigger than any other NYC room I have ever had, and there was plenty of room for both of us to walk around and live comfortably for the 4 days, 3 nights. The room I got has a seating area with a full-sized pullout couch, a small closet, refrigerator, coffee maker, safe, desk, ironing board and iron. In the sleeping portion had 2 double beds, a night stand and cable TV. The beds had good sheets and were comfortable for me. The bathroom is small, but it has a full sized tub and shower. There was plenty of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer for us, and 4 sets of towels. The windows open in the bathroom and bedroom in this hotel, so it was nice to get air in the room, and air out the bathroom after a shower. There is free wifi in the room, and there is an hardwire internet cord if you don't have wifi on your computer. There is a business center on the 1st floor, and there is a minimum $3 charge to use the computer and printer (we printed out tickets to the Empire State Bld). There is only one ice vending machine on the 1st floor. There are 2 well maintained elevators in the building, but they are slow, so going and getting ice from the 11th floor took a while. So, as we were going out for the evening, I took the ice bucket plastic bag in my purse. When we got back for the evening, I got ice from the ice machine on the 1st floor in the plastic bag to save me a trip back and forth on the slow elevators. There is vending on the 1st floor for soft drinks and snacks. Conveniently, there is a CVS at the end of the street if you need anything CVS carries. There is also a ""Greek Deli"" convenience market almost across the street from the CVS, so if you want any type of snack, soft drink, fruit, prepared ""Greek Deli"" foods 24 hrs/day, there you go. There is also a Chinese takeout place next to the lobby of the Comfort Inn. I don't know if it is good or not, but it is convenient. There is free breakfast at this hotel which includes breads, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juice, milk and donuts. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a bar before the building became a Comfort Inn. There is also a small but efficient and free workout room with a treadmill and 2 other cardio machines, and a bottled water. The street this hotel is on is quiet, and not a main road where taxis drive, and our stay was very quiet! Along the street are some well established antique stores. On weekends, across the street in a parking lot, is NYC style flea market that has been there since the 1980s (or as long as we have known about it), and the trinkets, gifts, antiques, carvings, art, jewelry, jade, records, etc are well worth taking a look at on your way in and out of the hotel on Saturday or Sunday afternoons. Down at opposite end of the street from the CVS is Madison Square Park (where the original Madison Square Arena used to be). It appears for the month of October is a street fair with food vendors, and artisan shop vendors. There were crepes, beer, wine, frites, bbq, apple dumplings, Belgian waffles, and other tasty treats that were so good! The shop vendors had hand and artisan made jewelry, craft toys, hand bags, dolls, clothing, home decor and a lot of other craft goods. After Nov 1st they all were moving to Union Square for the holiday shopping time. Because we were there on Halloween, the Halloween Parade came down 6th Ave and ended about 2 blocks away from the hotel. Surprisingly, we heard no noise from the parade at all, inside the hotel! It was fun to people watch along the parade route, and it was almost better than N.O. during Mardi Gras. We were also there on Nov 1st, All Saints Day, and down 6th Ave again was this long street fair with fair food vendors and lots of trinket booths for as far as we could see!

The room was tiny: if you left shoes out you were likely to trip over them; but it was clean and - as mentioned - the bed and pillows were great. Family in a two bed room had the same experience. Also, the bathroom, again, while small, seemed to have been recently remodeled. If only the towels were as sensational as the pillows.

I have to admit, this hotel was not my first choice, but the NYC Marathon was taking place the same weekend I needed to be in the city for business, so I had to take what I could get. After reading mixed reviews on this site, I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The hotel is a bit shabby around the edges – the common areas and rooms themselves could do with small maintenance upgrades that would improve the aesthetics all around. Some fresh paint on luggage-scuffed molding and cleaned-up sticky tables in the bar/breakfast/coffee area would make a rough-around-the edges hotel much more welcoming. Having said that, my room was comfortable and clean. Since the only room left in all of NYC for marathon weekend was #702, with three single beds for one person, it was sort of comical that I had my choice of three beds! However, the room was adequately sized, and probably for two people would also be comfortable. I think that three people sharing this room might crowd each other a bit. For three people, the narrow wardrobe and three full-sized drawers (plus nightstands) could be inadequate – for me, it was fine. There is also a full length mirror in addition to a large mirror behind the desk.There was a utilitarian bathroom, which was clean and stocked with hotel brand shampoo, conditioner, etc. Hot water took some time to kick in, but was adequate once it got going. I am a harsh judge of hot water supplies, since I have long, thick hair that is time-consuming to shampoo – finishing a rinse in icy water is not fun. Happily, this was not the case here. I did have trouble figuring out the idiosyncrasies of the hotel hair dryer, but Maintenance showed up in my room within minutes of my requesting help and showed me the right combination of buttons to push to get it started. Since it required some non-intuitive steps, I suggest updating the dryers or at least placing a short, well-written set of instructions next to the dryers.The fall temperature fluctuated between chilly and just-right, and the combination heating/cooling system in the room was fine and kept me comfortable. To my relief, there was a small desk in the room so I could easily set up my laptop properly. I was glad I’d brought along my own Ethernet cable since the one the hotel provided wasn’t working. The hotel room fridge had some unappetizing stains in it, but was obviously scrubbed and I felt fine putting take-out food in it. On a side note, the fridge was also properly cool. My boyfriend has diabetes and needs to store insulin when we do travel together, so I have become somewhat of an expert on hotel room refrigerator temperatures. I’m happy to say, this would have been fine for his needs, too. However, I have no idea why the room’s carpeting left black marks on my new white socks! The carpet appeared clean, but the sooty stains on my socks were definitely suspect.Linens were clean and the mattresses and pillows were comfortable. I should note that the hotel lobby and also my room’s bathroom had a strong smell of the type of odor-neutralizing spray they use to mask cigarette odors. Although my room was nonsmoking, underneath the smell of the disinfectant I could tell someone had smoked something in my bathroom in the not-too-distant past. However, this is not the hotel’s fault, and the spray’s odor was obnoxious but not unbearable.The hotel breakfast is a nice touch (cereals, muffins, etc), but nothing extraordinary. I certainly have had worse “free” hotel continental breakfasts, and “bland” is the keyword here, but not unappetizing. The coffee doesn’t have much kick, but since it is free and to-go cups are available, it is a good boost until you can find better coffee in the neighborhood. It was easy to hail a cab – they’re plentiful outside. Seems there is also a little flea market across the street on the weekends, and every kind of store you could want in the neighborhood. The walls are thin – at one point my neighbors voices sounded as if they were in my room! But, that lasted about five minutes, which made me wonder if perhaps they were in the lobby after all. At about 2am, there was a commotion down the street – a celebration or street party or some sort of Saturday night revelry. I turned on the room’s air system and the white noise drowned the street noise.The evening front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The daytime desk staff were also helpful, but “friendly” is not a word I’d use to describe them. There is a difference between a NYC non-nonsense attitude and the day staff’s downright brusque attitude – they might want to try a smile or two or consider eye contact when speaking to guests.All in all, I would stay here again with a caveat about price. My real sticking point is that there are “nicer” boutique hotels in Murray Hill for the same price as the Chelsea Comfort Inn, but with some luxury amenities and arguably better location. If the Chelsea would lower the room price, I’d stay here again. However, if my next visit is not during a peak time –like the Marathon – I would go to a boutique hotel for the same price, first.",Seattle,"tralala4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",7,2.0

I booked the rooms six months in advance to get the rate of $279/night for two rooms- one king bed and two queen! That is great for New York rates. The rooms were small but we were site seeing most of the time. The beds were comforable which was really important since we were probably on our feet 8-12 hours a day and needed good rest. The maid service was great. I had read poor reviews of the hotel even just one month before we traveled to New York so we were afraid... don't be afraid! We stayed on the sixth floor in a room that looked out to a beautiful old church. We could see the top of the Empire State Building from our room also. Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building are only about few blocks from the hotel. We never ran out of hot water, the elevators are slow but the hotel had two of them. The continental breakfast was nice with fresh fruit, juice, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereal, toast, and milk. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. It costs to use the hotel computer and there was no free internet hookup if you bring your own computer. The hotel is in the most perfect location because you can catch the subway only about 2 blocks away to go any which way. If you want to go to Time Square it is only 2 subway stops away. We found that if each of us bought a week long subway pass that was the best deal for us. The kids were pro subway riders in no time. Only four people can ride a cab at a time so we would have had to take two to go places. We were able to walk and take the subway everywhere! We bought a site seeing package on the 2nd day so we could go by double decker bus to see Brooklyn and all of the major popular places in Manahtten. We were able to identify places that we would like to spend more time at this way. We also took a two hour boat ride around Manhattan Island and that was awesome. We spent a lot of time in Time Square but it was cheaper for food and souvenirs down towards Chelsea area or in China Town. There is a flea market and antique stores all along 25th where the hotel is located. There are many deli's, restaurants, and a pharmacy within 2 or 3 blocks. The chinese food restaurant outside the hotel lobby was a favorite with the kids. Our favorite tour was to see the Statute of Liberty, which is really inexpensive but the lines are really long... so be prepared to wait in line. Central Park was beautiful in March and we just happened to get a few days of warm weather and sunshine in March! Bring an umbrella though... it rained some of the time. We bought tickets on line to see the Knicks and we saw the Pirate Queen on Broadway. We bought reduced tickets down on Time Square.

It is in a great location for me and the price was reasonable. My room was decent, it looked to be updated within the past year or so. It was much nicer than I was expecting. A little small but size was really OK for NY. However, I had a very difficult time getting hot water, thus the bad rating.I came to NY for a cooking class so when I got back to my room at 10:00 pm I was filthy and covered with grease. Definitely looking forward to a shower. I ran the shower for 20 minutes and got no hot water so I called the desk. An engineer was sent up to my room and confirmed no hot water. He did make a flippant comment though… “It’s the summer anyway, you don’t really need hot water, do you?” Uuhh, yes!I called down to the front desk again. This time I was told that nobody else had called and it must be just my floor. He didn’t offer me a room on another floor where I would supposedly find hot water. He said they would “re-set” the system and in 20 minutes I should have hot water.Well no hot water was available after 45 more minutes so I went to bed unhappy. I had a hard time sleeping. When I got up around 8:00am, there was hot water. When I came back at 11:00am there was none. When I checked out I complained…they do have a “guarantee”. The manager told me that yes, sometimes the boiler is turned off in the summer. But kept waffling about the details. Maybe it is “accidentally” turned off. I couldn’t quite get an answer with him going in circles trying hard not make good on their promise to not charge for an unpleasant stay.The impression I got was that hot water is available only during certain peak hours. So if you only want hot water during these hours then I could recommend the hotel. A hot shower available 24/7 is important to me especially during the summer when I am walking around in hot humid weather. So unfortunately I will not be returning.As a side, checking in and out took a while. Even though there appeared to be at times several folks available to help, only one person did the work, thus the wait. They did hold my luggage on check out day until late afternoon, which was nice.","Usa, Japan","BringHomeTroops</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Usa, Japan</strong>",51,1.0

Lots of young families as guests when I stayed in early April. Narrow halls. Room? Surprisingly spacious ((booked a single and got a king-size bed) , clean, with newly refurbished bath; a firmer mattress and better lighting would have been a plus (room must used sometimes to create a larger suite via the inside door; luckily, the next room neighbor was not noisy, though there is problem potential here ...)

Yes, there was some traffic noise and much merriment coming from the 4040 Club on Saturday night/Sunday morning, but not enough to make having a room at the front of the hotel a problem. Everything worked as it should and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Also, there was a good range of channels available on the TV which was great for that hour where you're collapsed in a heap before heading to bed. It was also nice to have the fridge to store drinks and small snacks. The location is also great - far enough away from the main tourist area to avoid the tackier side of NYC but with excellent access to everywhere you might want to go, either on foot or by public transport.On a slightly less positive note, while the decor and furnishings were fine the recent renovations seem to have been rushed, as it was obvious that a good few shortcuts had been taken. Also, the air conditioning/heating is very noisy, so could not have this on while trying to sleep. The desk staff were efficient if rather indifferent and the complimentary breakfast was okay if you just wanted to grab some cereal or a bagel - aside from that, it was quite dire.Weighing it all up though, I'd still return to this hotel quite happily. I booked reasonably far in advance so got my room for $107 a night plus taxes, a real bargain for the overall quality of the hotel and the area it's in. Also, as a lone female I never once felt threatened or unsafe while wandering around the area on my own. One final recommendation - on a warm evening its a real pleasure to pick up a coffee and enjoy it in lovely Madison Square Park, watching the madness of Fifth Avenue and appreciating the unique beauty of the Flatiron building.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","LindaRH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",45,4.0

We had a suite - one king bed in one room and two double beds in the other, with one bathroom ($279.00 per night). Our expectations were low given prior reviews, but knowing we would be in the room very rarely and that Comfort Inn should have a decent standard, we booked the hotel.The staff was definitely above average - very courteous, helpful, professional and kind. The hotel is decent. The elevator and corridors could use a facelift. A permanent ramp should be installed outside. The breakfast was okay. The seating area was dark and a hodge podge - it was a previously bar and had a lot of stuff sitting on it.The rooms were typical New York small, but were comfortable, the bathroom was clean. The safe was broken, but another was brought in shortly. As I mentioned above, the staff was very helpful. The air conditioning units were noisy, one room had it partially duct-taped, but we still slept fine.The location was good, a fairly residential/business area - not far from the Yellow line on the subway (you have to transfer quite a bit to get to different locations in the city, but this wasn't bad - even with three young kids) - and it is across from Madison Square Park and the Flatiron building. There is also a nice view of the Empire State Building as you cross over at Madison Square Park.Parking was also a consideration for us. With a stamp from the hotel, we paid $18.00 a day to park our minivan one block from the hotel with 24-hour access to it. Some hotels I checked were as high as $45.00 a day.Check-out was at noon, which was nice, and the staff held our bags for us, so we could continue to enjoy the city the remainder of the day.My husband and I stayed at The Library Hotel in May. This was a lovely hotel in a great location, and the price reflected it ($375 per night for one queen bed, lovely but small room with nice breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon).

The compact lobby is certainly pleasant enough and the smiling front desk staff is amiable and efficient. Our room was the biggest surprise. We had reserved a room with 2 double beds and sitting area with a sofa. It was spacious and everything is new and pristine here. All is tastefully decorated, wallpaper and carpeting are unblemished and the original crown molding is still intact and is a nice touch. The bathroom is all new and virtually sparkles. Comfort Inn`s standard amenities are included. We had free local phone calls, iron/ironing board, hairdryer, small refrigerator, free morning newspaper, and continental breakfast included. There is also a small exercise room and business center. Our new beds were firm and extremely comfortable and everything was very quiet, including the new air conditioner which was appreciated in the sultry July heat.

The Comfort Inn actually matched all of these requirements. After booking through Choicehotels[-] and having a tough time finding reviews on this place, TripAdvisor's reviews and photos proved to give us the peace of mind that the hotel would be ok. Recently acquired by Choice - Comfort Inn, it is obvious that the company is doing lots of rennovations on the property. The lobby referenced several times in prior reviews, has indeed been rennovated and looks rather nice. The dining area, where the complimentary breakfast is served, is badly in need of updating. However, as expected, they're tackling the most obvious and common areas first. Staff was curteous and helpful. All spoke good English.The room was TINY! Our best guess is maybe 10x12. For our stay, we had 3 people, so the room was equipped with a double bed and twin. Opening the main door to the room found us hitting the twin bed everytime. Wall air conditioning kept the room cool. The room had been remodeled with nice crown molding, new carpet and wallpaper. The bedding was cheap and by no way held up to the new luxury standard of ""heavenly bed"", etc. But, we all slept soundly every night. We heard absolutely no noise once in the room.The location was amazing. Across the street from a lovely park. Next door to JayZee's night club 40/40. About 2 blocks from the 23rd Street subway station. Walking distance (a bit of a hike) to Times Square. Right near the Flat Iron building. 2 drug stores around the corner, other general shopping nearby too.Travellers to NYC have to remember that affordable rooms in the heart of Manhattan will not be like the suburban hotel standards we're all accustomed to. Keeping in mind that rooms likely built in the 20's and 30's are small and old, you're probably not going to find much of a better deal than the Comfort Inn on 25th Street.","Cleveland, Ohio","Inspire2767</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",10,3.0

It was also a 20 minute walk from times square, and 1 minute walk to the flatiron building down the road on the right. We found an amazing little cafe/restaurant called COSI (left out of the building then left again at end of road carry on until you see it on the left again). Lifts were always working and towels and bedding always made for when we returned from our ventures. This was the perfect hotel for me.

After seeing the reviews over the last month we were serious considering changing hotels but after contacting the travel agent, who contacted the hotel to see what the building situation was we decided to keep the reservation. When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and given a really lovely, large room on the 11th floor (1107) which had a view of the Empire State Building from the bathroom, was newly decorated and very clean and fresh. Yes, the towels are small but the hotel is cheap and you could buy a big towel for less than $10 in a cheap store if you were really that bothered. The building work was still ongoing throughout our stay but it was mostly painting so the lifts were never out of use, although when we left on the 31st there was heavy building work going on in the lobby behind a partition wall. We were asked to change rooms after 2 nights because they wanted to replace and paint the doors on the landing we were on, which was a bit of a nuisance, but it would have been worse to stay on that landing through the building work and they extended our check out time to compensate for the time spent moving.The new room was 1107, which was to the same standard but without the view. Every day the room was cleaned and all the towels were replaced, we had use of a safe and fridge and had an adaquate sized wardrobe but only 6 hangers. Throughout our ten nights you could not notice the noise from outside the hotel, which I've never experienced before in my 5 previous stays in NYC in other hotels. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful to us and we never felt unsafe in our room or on the street outside, even late at night. The location is great, really convenient for lots of places. Try the food at L.A.

I suppose location. The location of the hotel is 25th Street (btw Broadway & 6th Ave). This is away from the glitz and glamour, about 9 blocks down from Empire State Building (10 min walk) and about 20 mins downtown from Time Square. It's situated by a couple of subway stops that are good for servicing the rest of the Manhattan area. I found the location fine.As for the hotel itself, I'm going to try and be objective about this as at the moment there is a major redecoration going on and this is going to be a MAJOR upset to a lot of people. The rooms themselves are small but clean with nice big double bed and shower room. Views from our room were dreadful but I don't think this would matter where you were as the location of the hotel is such that there is nothing really to look at anyway. I had no complaints about the room.However, the rest of the hotel (corridors, lobby, lifts etc) are a mess at the moment due to the work going on and there's paint and workmen everywhere (sometimes taking over the lifts making going up and down the floors a pain in the backside). The work looked as if it could be going to go on for a while though cannot say exactly for how long. Perhaps would be worth checking with your tour operator before booking.One thing I would say about the rooms and this is a bit of a pet hate of mine anyway is that they are arranged such that at the end of a corridor three doors are next to each other (forming three sides of a square if you follow me) which means noise does carry if people are hanging around outside the rooms. Also, the fire doors slam which makes a dreadful noise which can wake you up in the night/morning. Sound very easily comes into the rooms from the corridors.I was happy with it overall (though maybe I'm just not fussy) however though who perhaps are used to 3/4 star accomodation will NOT be pleased with this.",Merseyside,"pmfrench</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Merseyside</strong>",25,2.0

Reserved rooms trough Travelnow for 139+taxes and fees so three nites were 500 USD altogether.

IT was much better than we hoped for, our room 1001 was completely renovated with 30 some channel tv an okay sized room and an extremely clean and comfortable ...i would say downright perfect bathrooom. The bed was comfy, the towels were really thin but oh well. The staff unlike mentioned before were not all that bad. The girl and the younger guy and middle aged guy were very nice..only the older one was grumpy looking. Overall they were efficient and friendly enough. The view from our room as you see the picture was probably the worst one can wish for, but personally I prefer a cozy and clean place rather than a dirty with great view..because that is about the choice you have in New York except if you are willing to pay 500 and up a night. The Arlington is in a very good neighbourhood I would say 5 minutes to ES Building and two minutes to the Subway and Flatiron Building. In the neighbourhoods there are plenty of places for breakfast for under two dollars. If you are a power tourist you should get the new york pass and see as much as possible. Buy the weekly or daily metropass for 24 and 7 dollars they re well worth it if you plan to see a lot. The Arlington by the way is under construction and soon all the rooms will be nice, but for now I think only the top couple floors are in good condition.

(Most of the time I took the stairs, as doing so was much faster than waiting for the elevator).The room was tiny, but I kind of expected that to some extent. The view was of the adjacent building, but one doesn't go to a hotel like this for the view. TV reception (which seemed to be over the air, not cable?) was fuzzy.The phone required a deposit, even for local calls (and they were expensive). My cell phone didn't work inside the building, so I had to step outside each time I needed to make a call.The bathroom was ok, if a bit musty. However, in 2002, I noticed some flaking wall material near the radiator. This was unnerving, as visions of asbestos danced in my head....In 2000, there was a little breakfast room, and upon check-in, customers were given vouchers good for breakfast. After one breakfast dealing with low-quality food and snotty staff, I decided to have my breakfast elsewhere. This facility had closed entirely when I went back in 2002; I don't know if they've ever reopened it. (There's a adjacent Chinese restaraunt that may be associated with this hotel, but I didn't try it).The immediate neighborhood is fine, (on 25th between 5th and 6th Aves) is fine, but somewhat dim after dark. You're not too far away from busier streets (and 24-hour delis) though....The subway is just a block south, and plenty of buses and cabs ply 5th and 6th ave. The hotel will also call a car service for you, if you need to get to the airports.All in all, probably not the worst place, but you can probably do better, with careful searching of the travel sites, discussion groups, and, of course, Tripadvisor!","los angeles, ca","Temporary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles, ca</strong>",171,2.0

After booking my holiday to stay at the Carter Hotel, a few weeks later the travel agent advised me to change to the Arlington because of all the bad reports, and after seeing the Hotel Carter in the flesh, I am grateful. This was my first time in New York. I went over by myself to fulfil an ambition of mine - to visit this fantastic city.I couldn't believe the location of the hotel, it was great, right beside the junction of 5th & Broadway and next to the Flat Iron Building. I enjoy antiques and got a further surprise, when I found that the street was full of antique shops and home to a flea market at the weekend, where I got some great bargains. The street does look a bit rough, but I never had a problem with anyone. The hotel has good facilities for its price. My room was clean, and kept clean every day by the cleaners. It had a shower with hot water, a large comfortable bed and a TV with about 20 stations. I know we don't go on holiday to watch TV but its good if you don't want to be out at night. The room also had an electronic safe. The view from the window was a brick wall, I laughed when I looked out and thought it was quite novel after seeing so many movies featuring the city. It's all part of the experience. In the reception, there are vendors, phones and a computer offering internet access, which was great for communicating with people back home. The staff were very helpful and friendly - I bought a phone card at the Empire State and couldn't get it to work right, asked the receptionist at Arlington for help and she phoned the number and put me through free of charge. The card wasn't working because I forgot to skip the ""0"" at the start of the area code, there's a handy tip! There is also a Chinese restaurant on the ground floor, I never ate there, so can't tell you what the food's like. Just around the corner is a small grocery shop which offers a good selection of hot and cold snacks. I usually went there in the morning for breakfast on the move and then on to McDonalds, Burger King and loads of sandwich bars at night. There is a nice restaurant at the Rockefeller centre, but if you want to eat there, remember and pack for the dress code.I never took a taxi or the subway anywhere except to and from the airport. I just liked to walk from place to place and take in as much of the city as possible. Add to that, they drive like maniacs, practically every car has a dent! The hotel is only a short walk from the Empire State Building, which offers stunning views of the city and is close to many points of interest. Overall, I thought the hotel was great. The decor was out of date but who cares? Your here to admire and enjoy the city, not the confines of your hotel. It it does the job especially for someone like me on a budget. I can't understand all the negative comments other people have made. The staff were friendly, the room comfortable and clean, great location and cheap - What more do you want? If you have the money, then spend it on a better hotel rather than be a stooge. You get what you pay for. If -no- WHEN I go back to New York, I'll be staying here again for sure!The attached photo is a view from the top of the Empire State looking towards downtown Manhattan.

There is also a small Chinese take-away restaurant accessible from the hotel lobby with 3 or 4 tables that you can sit at if you are looking for a cheap meal before heading out for the night.Located close to the Flatiron building, almost at the junction of Broadway and 5th Avenue, the Arlington is in a wonderful central spot of Manhatten - a few minutes from the Empire State building and there are plenty of pubs, clubs, shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.I would definately stay there again and highly recommend it to those who want a comfortable (but not luxury) place to sleep - if you ever feel you want to sleep when there is so much happening in New York City!",,funky_desmond,18,4.0

The room was at the back of the hotel so fairly quiet. The hotel in general could do with some love and attention but it's clean. We had to ask for extra blankets as the room was very cold, but we weren't in it for long. At least the shower was hot!

We got into our room and found the same problem as, Boston Dec 2004 did, the room was so hot, we had all windows open at all times. However the room was clean and tidy. When we travel we like to do our own thing, however some things arose where we asked the staff for some help, ie airport transfers which we paid 52 dollars for. We booked the time of the transfer with the staff behind reception for 4.30PM to go to the airport. At 4.30 am we were woken from our sleep, and being rudely asked why we were not downstairs! An honest mistake, maybe??? Our receipt stated that we were to be picked up at PM. The problem was how badly we were treated. We later went downstairs to confirm that our booking was still confirmed for the afternoon, again this was to much of an effort for the staff and again were treated badly by the staff. I would like to say that it was only one staff member that was rude, however they were ALL rude, unprofessional, and unwilling to help us.Overall, we had a clean room in a hotel with a good location.

The reception is filthy and has a chinese restaraunt attached which is basically a 'down and out' drop in centre!! The rooms are smelly dingy and the bedding had hairs in it. I was forced to buy my own bedding and pillows as I couldn't bring myself to sleep on the hotels sheets. We stayed for 3 nights and eventually checked out as the final straw were mice running around in the ceiling!!!!!!!!!!! Our room door was tried for entry one night and because we were in we didn't get robbed but we basically felt vulnerable and unsafe at all times in this Hotel.

There is a fridge, safe and tv in the room.We had a View of the main street which looked a bit shady, however if you look up towards the sky, you get a great view of the Empire state building. The heating was on the brink a couple of times and when it was reported, the staff didn`t come up and fix it. It seemed to resolve it self for some reason. The club 40/40 is along the street but we didn`t hear excessive noise.

The staff do charge to keep your luggage but it is a small charge of $1.50 and it is kept in a safe place. I honestly cannot fault this hotel.

All quite usable.Window had ugly view out to fire escapes etc, but there are big thick curtains which you can keep closed.The radiator makes a bizarre hissing sound when you switch it on, this is quite unnerving. But it's ok really.Towels were replaced every day, and the bed was made up with fresh sheets. It was nice and quiet in the evenings, and is in a safe area. It's a stone's throw from the Flatiron building so nice and central, about 10 minutes walk from Penn station, and handy for buses and subway.Carpets are rather old and the room really could use a lick of paint. Oh, and the door rattled a bit whenever the fire doors in the corridor were opened/closed.But it's safe, clean and comfortable and that's what matters. At around $150/night, this is excellent value for a capital city (especially for us lucky UK tourists with ultra low $/£ prices right now).

We could have overlooked all these things but could not overlook the nightclub below which spewed out music well in the night.

The triple room I had with my brothers was clean and came with a mini fridge, free use of the room safe, large tv, good air conditioning unit and a decent power shower, oh and three single beds! (phew, no fights over which two have to share the double) The location just off Broadway couldn't have been more central (just a mile from Time Square and across from the Flat Iron building.) The room was cleaned every day with the beds made and towels changed. Ok, it's rough around the edges with chipped paint work and the lift is the last word in speed but it's excellent value for money, secure and in a good, safe, central location to get out and about in Manhattan. I'd happily use them again.","London, UK","BoardingPass19744</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, UK</strong>",1,4.0

Not something you really see in any hotels but it really gave us all 4 good night sleeps.The bathroom was small, but perfectly fine. The shower was great, really powerfull and hot at all times. The room was cleaned everyday and we got fresh towels and soap. Plus there is a free safe in the room which was a great surprise.As for other reviews saying that the area was a bit rough, i didnt really see any evidence of that.

I stayed in a twin room from july 7th to july 21st. Location: The hotel is in a great location, at the corner of 5th and Broadway. The Flatiron building is round the corner, the Empire State Building is less than a ten minute walk away as is Penn station, Madison Square garden and lots of shopping. There are some great bars nearby too such as the Flatiron lounge (really good cocktails and a great atmosphere). Theres also a Subway around the corner that brings you to times square, central park and downtown. Plus a 24 hour deli at the end of the block for food. On saturday and sunday there's a huge antique market across the road from the hotel. Hotel: We asked for a twin room and got room 911. A little worrying but everything was fine. The beds were comfy, the room was clean, the tv, fridge and safe worked, we couldn't hear noise from any other room and there was always hot water no matter when we showered. We were at the rear facing a an internal courtyard so didn't get much light, but there was no noise from the street. The aircon was in the window and a bit rattly sometimes but i never woke up with a sore throat that aircon causes usually so i'm not complaining. The staff were great and the lady on reception was really friendly and helpful. There's a place to store your luggage on the last day and arranging a shuttle to the airport was easy. There's an internet kiosk in the lobby (which has amazing ceiling plasterwork) but it's a bit expensive. We mainly used the easyeverything in times square. All in all, i was really happy with the hotel, it's great value for what you get. Don't go expecting a five star luxury place and you won't be dissappointed, it's easily as nice as some 3star places i've stayed and i'll definitaly stay there again. And a quick tip, there's 2 elevators not just one, the second one is opposite the gift store and no-one seemed to use it but us when we were there.","Belfast, United Kingdom","devastar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belfast, United Kingdom</strong>",19,4.0

Bed is small, for a 5'11"", my feet was hanging out at the edge of the bed. I went with relatives and friends. I must said the size of the rooms varies. #1110 was smaller than #307 and #307 was smaller than #301. In all three rooms, none was suited with two beds (as displayed on expedia) I guess we were expecting to see two beds per room, but were disappointed when arrived. BUT location is a plus!! If you just need a place to sleep at night and goes out during the day, this is a good bargain (as many have mentioned, you get your own bath in your own room, thus one of our room has a very tiny bathroom).Club 40/40 is just few hundred feet away from the hotel. We even saw a Maybach and a Bently parked near the hotel :)Hotel staffs were very nice and friendly.If they can improve one thing, that would be get a bigger and more comfortable bed.

The only thing to watch at this hotel is the reception. It is small and inefficient and there were some messages that we did not receive, do not rely on them. I had a brilliant time in New York and it will not disapoint. Remember that the cars dont stop for you to cross theroad and tax is added on after pricing.

Just like the subject says, you really get value for every dollar you pay: 149 $ (including taxes) for 4, you really can't beat that, right?LOCATION: Great location, walking distance from many interesting locations (E.g. Flatiron building, ESB, Union square and charming Madison square park) and near metro stations. We used metro a lot, and found it fast, safe and the network was extensive. Even though we like to walk in the cities, it is wise to travel fast to the location you are interested in with metro and then walk as long as you like and then take metro back to your hotel.RECEPTION: We arrived quite late to the hotel, and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful (behind the bullet proof glass, but I understand that it is more or less common in New York). Later on the other employees we saw were not that friendly, but every time we needed or asked something we were served seemly (at least in Finnish standards).ELEVATOR AND CORRIDORS: Elevator was ok, and pretty spacious also, corridors not so inspiring, but hey, who spends more time in corridors than is needed? Anyway, after the narrow passage to our room, we were just a little afraid what waited us behind the door.ROOM: However, our frights were not met, and the room was clean, pretty spacious and decently decorated. I wouldn't recommend eating from the floors, but if you do that in any place, maybe you should try and seek help anyway :) We had two bedroom junior-suite, but I think the only reason it was called suite was because it had two rooms. The beds were pretty firm, even hard you might say, but every morning I said to my wife that they were actually quite good to sleep in. The view was not to be called anything but the wall for the next building, but it also meant that there were no street noise at all. Air-conditioning was basic ""window-installed"" box, working and useful even in May (outside temperatures were from 20 - 30 degrees Celcius). TV with maybe 20 channels, and a refrigerator which was not working when we arrived, but was fixed immediately when we asked for it.BATHROOM: Ok, next to the bathroom, decent with shower and bath. I didn't try the bath, but shower worked fine, considering the two faucet system they still use in the US, it takes five minutes to adjust the water temperature right (that's because the system not the hotel). Enough hot water for all four of us. Towels were quite small, though they were changed regularly and were clean. Overall, the bathroom was not luxurious by any standards, but either we weren't fright to use it when needed to.MISCELLANEOUS: No breakfast included, but no problem to find good diners and delis nearby. Good selection of brochures, ""what to do"" leaflets and maps in the lobby. If you have a spesific question about the hotel or NY, I will gladly help if I can. Sadly one week is not enough in NY, but now we know what to do next time. Have a very nice stay in NY!

The room was nothing to write home about but it was clean and it must have been the quietest room in New York. It was facing the back, a very small backyard - almost like a shaft, and you could barely make out what the weather was like as the shaft was that narrow and we stayed on the fourth floor. But we slept like babies, even though the pillows were like concrete.But since it was quiet, clean and with a great location (just steps away from Broadway and Fifth Avenue) and for that price (we paid $90 for a double) - I would definitely recommend the Arlington.","Stockholm, Sweden","Coastal3050</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",3,4.0

If you want an awesome hotel, with a spa and a doorman and that looks after your every whim. Look elsewhere. The Arlington is for the person on a budget that wants good value for money.My two nights at the Arlington cost $85 each, which is a great price for a double bed and a private bathroom and really great maid service in mid-town Manhattan. No complaints about the bed - it was nice and firm. No complaints about smells, bugs, or poor furniture. The place was nice and clean and smelled fresh.The location is almost perfect. Within a longish walk to central park and a longish walk to the tip of Manhattan. If you're in good shape, you can walk to almost all of the major sites in New York without ever taking a taxi or a subway. The neighbourhood that the hotel is in itself is nothing to write home about, but it's a five minute subway ride to the Village, Soho, Chinatown... well, basically every cool neighbourhood in town.The place isn't perfect - no onsite parking, no tub, slightly worn look to the walls and carpets, ever so slightly dodgy street (nothing I'd worry about, though), slight wait for hot water, and thin walls.

We had read the reviews previously and booked the hotel on the basis that the rooms were clean. We were not disappointed as the room was vey clean including the bathroom which had a very nice power shower in it. Our room was in the back of the hotel so we had no view whatsoever but as the 40/40 nightclub is only a couple of doors away we didn't get the noise from that filtering through. One great item we were impressed with was the FREE OF CHARGE safety deposit box in the room, which gave us piece of mind to leave our passports and valuables in while we explored the great city. That is what we came to NY for, to explore, so we only used the room for sleeping, washing and a place to store our stuff. At £75 per night for the room (including taxes) it was money well spent and I shall seriously consider staying at this hotel again when I return to NY in the hopefully not too distant future. PS. I'd heard stories of cockroaches in New York, so I'm glad to report that not one was sighted here. PPS.

Sure the pictures look alright, but the room distantly resembles the picture. The street entrance is not very appealing, but the neighborhood itself isn't bad. Though I could hear people yelling from next door's 40/40 night club in the early morning hours. The ""HO"" as both sides of the neon sign indicate, is located across the street from a church and about a half block from downtown and maybe 2 blocks from the nearest subway entrance. It's a good location, walking distance to everything a traveler could use (CVS Pharmacy is about 1/4 block away and Starbucks is right around the corner).One of the first things I noticed when I got into the room was that not as big as the picture presents it to be. The bed is about 2 feet away from the desk and minifridge and close to the walls on the other sides. The beds are firm and bouncy, the pillows like slivers of padding, though one of the pillows was fluffier than the other. The blankets are terrible, like a cheap polyester blanket that has barely survived hundreds of washes in the laundry machine. Otherwise the room appears to have a pretty recent coat of orangish textured paint, but is well lit despite the reflected light from the walls.Lets move onto the bathroom. First thing you'll notice when you walk in is that it's hot as an inside of a black car basting under the hot sun. Opening the small 1'x 2.5' window helps a little, but because of the 3"" diameter hot water pipe that runs veritcally from floor through to the ceiling along one wall, you can never really cool the room. But maybe because of that pipe, the shower was hot most of the time and water pressure was good in our room. The tub/shower is like a mushroom farm with the curtain closed. The curtain is a heavy baby blue plastic that blocks out all light, while you can leave one end of the shower curtain open, it tends to splash water about. One last thing, I'd suggest bringing your own towels because the one's they provide are thinner than the rags I use to dry parts of my car. They also don't provide hand or face towels, just bath towels sized for a 4 foot tall child. The towels are clean though.Positives: - Friendly and helpful staff - someone always at front desk 24 hours a day, maid does a very good job organizing room and bathroom - restocked every morning with new bars of soap and mouthwash - free minifridge and safe (together about the size of a nightstand) - clean sheets (I didn't have a blacklight on hand to really check) - great location - free HBO - no visible cockroaches or rodents - chinese restaurant, atm, internet access in lobby - internet access available in rooms for $0.50/minNegatives: - no face or hand towels, bath towels very thin and not very absorbent - bathroom is hot, kids could get burned on the pipe - expensive for what we paid - rooms are crampedYou might get a better room rate by calling the hotel direct then going through one of the internet referral sites.","Fremont, CA","Destination28173</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, CA</strong>",4,2.0
