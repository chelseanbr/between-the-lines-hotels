Upon check-in, all of my concerns were eliminated. There were no weird smells, soggy carpet, noise issues, or hygiene/cleanliness issues. Our room was on the pool side of the property and looked out on a quiet and picturesque view. The bed was incredibly comfortable and our room was spotless. We opted for daily parking at the nearby garage, which was arranged through the hotel. The walk to the garage was short and easy, and was much better (and probably cheaper) than trying to find our own parking arrangements. We appreciated the chairs and beach towels available from the front desk, as well as the hotel's willingness to hold our luggage after check out so we could enjoy our final day on the beach.

So when I entered my room I found shaved hairs everywhere. In shower...in sink..in bed...So I called frontdesk. Sorry but as being a hotelmanager I would never have any of this staff working for me. The frontdesk people are not really friendly and it is like they really do not like their job. When you check in they do not give you any information about towels or the hotel itself. I am a back patient and had to carry my luggage myself!! Anyway...When I called frontdesk for the hairs, they sent somebody to clean it up. It was better but still I had to clean it up myself if I wanted it clean...not my view of being on a holiday.Also the next day I found hairs and even a dirty cloth that they forgot. They did not clean my coffee cup etc..So for me that cleaning team can defenitely improve a lot.Also the frontdesk can defenitely do better. If I have a simple question like what time does the swimmingpool has sun? I get an answer like I don't know...really?? You work there...it is a small thing to know.. But anyway.. also for you to know that if you are a light sleeper...forget to sleep before 1am. The hotel is situated at one of the bussiest streets in Honolulu...constant cars hunking...loud music,...I would never stay here again.",Costa Rica,"Ilseguanoke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Costa Rica</strong>",24,1.0

Tried booking a Pearl Harbour tour at the desk, but staff had no idea what we were asking for. Go figure. For what we paid, we felt very unimpressed.

Sorry not very happy about this. Got to our room, opened the door and was immediately hit by the stench. Had to open the outside doors to try and get this to clear. When we took our shoes off, found out this stench was probably caused by the wet carpets in the room, great to squelch across.

It covers the toiletries in your shower, Wifi, water in the lobby area, and the ability to check out a beach towel to take to the beach. In other words, the basic amenities of a hotel.

Best part of the room are the cool Japanese toilets and endless channels to peruse through.Only cons were that our room had a weird odour to it when we entered. And it was a bit more beaten down with drawers and cabinets that didn’t close properly. Also, we were given the wheelchair accessible room even though we didn’t request one. The extra handrails in the shower and pullout chair in the tub were a nuisance. Thought we would get a regular tub combo or a glass shower as advertised when we booked.

We thought the room would have more of a “real” kitchen but compared to other hotel rooms, it just had a few burners (no stove) and a toaster. Be careful about picking a room. The hotel is on a busy street and if you are on a low floor, it’s both very noisy late into the night and not particularly private. Other lower floor rooms look onto a courtyard. The toilet includes seat warmers and a bidet. Being an American family with little experience with such things, we were both highly amused and kind of weirded out. The bed was very comfortable.

Circled around the building twice before actually finding it. There is no parking, you will end up parking under a different building at no discounted rate.Parked in a parking lot nearest to them for an hour while dealing with the receptionist (read below) before finally being directed to the cheaper lot. That was an extra $15 bucks. Price sounds great and the reviews seem solid, DON'T DO IT. This place is a hole in the wall, and not like in a good way like your favorite Mexican restaurant. Tiny rooms to go along with the tiny water bottles they give out. The full size waters are only $4. Booked a room for a staycation with my wife recently through their company website full price, no Priceline or anything. When we arrived we were received warmly and then offered a hilariously small room with 2 twin beds! The room actually would have benefited if they were bunk beds as there was no space left to walk around the beds the room was so cramped. Obviously that room wouldn't work for the occasion. The receptionist was understanding and to her credit, apologized and tried to help out. Astonishingly though, they were all out of king size bed rooms on a non eventful Thursday. I only saw or heard 1 other guest during our time there...guess they only have that 1 king room they use in all their pictures! She offered an upgrade to their executive room for 50 dollars, and after some back and forth I begrudgingly agreed. She called her manager to get the approval, unfortunately for the employees, they are all micromanaged. The manager denied the request and refused any discount. At this point it would be more than double my initial cost to pay to upgrade. I was ready to pay the cancellation fee and just go somewhere else when I was informed about the cancellation policy. For me to cancel, I would be charged 1 full night's reservation... My full amount. Having only a little pride left I was done and leaving. No cancellation, just leaving. Then she came up with another idea, the family suite. This was a conjoined double room and had a king bed and 2 twin beds. If I remember right it was about 100 to upgrade, still nearly doubling my cost but at this point I knew they had won, they didn't need to be nice they had my money either way. It was clever marketing, bait and switch and complete lack of real customer service but it worked. No discount given, they made more money and I was given a smile and new room key. The room was fine and we made sure to test all the beds just to get our money's worth! Made the best of it and until finding mold growing out of the air vent we'd considered the whole event neutral. Keep in mind I live here, I understand it's humid and stuff grows fast...but mold in the air vent is dangerous and unacceptable. Call it icing on the cake but realizing you just paid (nearly)double what you should have to breath mold all night kind of put a damper on the rest of the weekend.

We definitely found that and more with Polynesian Residences. When we checked in, we were greeted by a very nice and professional receptionist who presented us with fresh, scented, and dampened hand towels to use after our long flight. Our first impression of the hotel was that it was air conditioned (which we had assumed would be the case but found out isn't always the case for Hawaiian hotels) and had a pleasant smell throughout. We took an elevator up to our room, which was a clean, modern, pleasant-appearing room with 2 queen beds. We had no trouble signing in to our free Wi-Fi. The bathroom was very clean, modern, bright, had a nice shower (no bathtub), and a Japanese toilet. There was a very small balcony that was unfurnished which we didn't really use (except to occasionally dry out swimsuits), but you could conceivably fit two or three small chairs out there. We had a room with a small kitchenette -- the sink, stovetop, Keurig machine, and provided dishes were useful but there wasn't really a lot of counter space. My biggest critique would be the lack of counter space and walking-room around the beds, but I still found what we paid for the room well worth it. Our room overlooked a pool that wasn't very large, but was private and never crowded during our stay. I used the pool three times and found the temperature very comfortable. We also had laundry facilities in the hotel that had 2 washing machines and 1 dryer that took quarters for payment (the concierge also had detergent available for sale if needed). During our stay, we used the laundry facilities twice and did not have to wait much (if at all) either time for a washer or dryer. The hotel had a subtle entrance that was on a main street in Waikiki, which was a short walk to nearby restaurants and also to the beach (a little over 5 min). If you are looking for a modern, comfortable, affordable hotel that isn't upscale or right on the beach, then Polynesian Residences is definitely one that you should consider.","Northfield, Minnesota","brynjay2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northfield, Minnesota</strong>",1,5.0

The pool area is under construction as it is a portion of the lobby. This should be finished soon. This did not hinder our stay whatsoever And I knew this when booking. The entrance and reception area have been completely remodeled and are fabulous. We were warmly greeted with fresh hot towels and bottles of water upon check-in. The remainder of the lobby and still under construction and there were saws and hammering going on while we were checking in. Slightly annoying, but expected. We got up to our room and we were so pleased to see how well appointed the room was. The inside of this hotel is five stars all the way. The construction stopped at a decent hour and began on Saturday morning at a decent hour. I’m sitting in our room facing the pool right now and we can hear the construction going on outside but it’s not unbearable. This place is going to be awesome once it’s finished!The proximity to everything cannot be beat. We are a block from the beach, and along the way are some of the best food trucks we’ve ever eaten from. This place is a great value during construction as their rates have dropped. I highly recommend anyone staying here who is not going to be cooped up in a room during the entire visit. It could be a little difficult to take a nap during the day, but we prefer to nap under palm trees in the wind on the beach!

The beds and pillows were very comfortable. There were plenty of drawers for storage, but not many hangers. The room was well lit but the bathroom was not--the lighting was very bad for putting on makeup. The bathroom had plenty of counter space and the shower head was good. Construction was a very noisy inconvenience and was expected to last for another three months. We heard pounding noises during the day, and we had to enter and leave through a crummy back alley. Once our water was turned off abruptly. I suggest waiting until construction is complete. The location is very good, near restaurants of all types and shopping.

Also because the housekeeping never brought us four sets of towels for our stay. (Family of 4) *Recommend not getting a vehicle except for the day(s) you want to travel around the island. Most sites and restaurants are an easy walk, bus ride or Uber to/fro location.

The location was close to the beach, shops, restaurants, and everything you could want to do in and around Waikiki. The rooms are beautifully renovated, and we cooked most meals there. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are clean and bathroom is gorgeous! The staff was extremely friendly. Parking was $28 US, but I did some driving around/research, and this is actually a great deal. Plus you are able to come and go as needed. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend asking for a non street side, however the double pane doors/windows blocked 90% of the street noise. The ABC and drug store are very close for all your food needs. The pool area was nice, however my only disappointment would be there are no lounge chairs! When you log into their pool WiFi (WiFi strength was great everywhere) it even shows a picture of the pool with chairs. I would have spent much more time around the pool/sun deck if it had chairs.

Had a great room with a view of the city. LOVED being able to walk to everything - beach, shopping, restaurants. The hotel has free beach towels and some beach toys like floats and snorkel gear which is nice. Coin laundry on almost every floor (careful b/c a couple of them malfunction). My room was beet spacious with a kitchenette and a nice modern shower. Really enjoyed my stay. *Note: The reception desk staff are less than helpful. I booked the room online with Agoda.com and the reception staff (first a lady and then a man) told me they don’t accept bookings from Agoda though I’d received an email confirmation and was showing it to them. Since I was there, frustrated, tired and loaded with luggage, I asked if he could just book my room directly and asked what the hotel’s rate was. He lied to me and ultimately charged me $70 MORE for that one night than I’d originally booked it for even though the hotel’s system price was about $20 less than what I’d booked it for.

It’s hard to get to. You have to leave someone in the car on the beachwalk street to unload luggage.This is a very old hotel that they just threw in some cheap updated stuff over top of the old to make it look nicer.The first room we were given the keys didn’t work, then the next room was 2 twin beds which we book a king bed.Our final room was a king bed. The rooms look and feel like they are just lightly cleaned.The floors are slanted throughout the room. This place definitely has structural and foundational issues.Overnight parking is $28. Paid lots are a far walk; 20 minutes for $1/hour.The road noise and people, music, etc is incredibly loud from the hotel room. Hard to fall asleep.The beds are a bit too soft which can hurt your low back and hips.I would not recommend staying at this hotel at all.If you are just here to party and drink and need a place to crash then this place would be okay for you.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the room was great, the bathroom was clean. I highly recommend it. Our room was on the 4th floor and overlooked Ala Moana Rd, theres is some outside noise that filters in especially during night (I think its from the parties at hard rock cafe, which is 2 doors down), but we had a baby with us and she was never woken up by it. So I don't think its a problem. The staff are friendly, they helped us with directions and recommendations. However if you're expecting a 5 star lobby you won't find that here, a corridor leads you to the reception desk and that's about it, no sitting areas or drinks. Before we booked this hotel, we were considering the hyatt centric, it was $800 dearer for the same days that we needed, I ended up going into the Hyatt centrics lobby so my little one could use the bathroom and it had all the bells and whistles of a 5 star hotel, but then you pay the price for it.

The pictures shown of the hotel are EXACTLY as it is. Fully renovated rooms, clean, modern, sleek, spacious, huge modern bathroom.. couldn't have asked for anything more!From the outside and the reception area, the hotel doesn't look flash at all. Very plain, simple and basic. No bell concierge to meet and greet, definitely no fancy or inviting hotel entrance, if anything it was hot and stuffy as you enter into the small narrow walk way. I actually felt extremely worried upon checkin if the hotel was going to live up to my standard or had I booked an absolute disaster? Not a pleasant feeling at all when you know you have pre paid for a booking for 7 nights!!However, the friendly and welcoming reception host was a pleasure to deal with. Even more surprising was the offering of cold refreshment towels and water bottles. What a relief after dealing with the heatwave outside! It's these small simple gestures that make a huge difference when you first deal with the hotel! Well done! More surprisingly is when you first enter the modern mirrored lift and into the foyer of the floor level. Wow! Very spacious, clean and modern! Well decorated! Even better is when you enter the room itself. Totally blew my mind as I did not expect it to be as good as it was! Very impressive and extremely HAPPY with my choice. This room was going to be our home for the next 7 nights and thank goodness I knew immediately I would feel comfortable and relaxed being here!Overall, the Polynesian Residence is a basic hotel that doesn't offer all the bells and whistles as the other major chains. Like your buffet breakfast, concierge, trolley/bus transfer amenities etc. However, for the price you pay, the location of the hotel and the modern clean rooms, this totally outweighs being in a major hotel. As a family, we have been fortunate to have travelled to many destinations all over the world and our standard of hotels is quite high! This is our 4th trip to Hawaii and this would have to be one of our top hotels we've stayed at. We definitely will be back again and I wouldn't book anywhere else but the Polynesian Residence. So thank you to the staff and the hotel for making this trip one of our best and memorable holiday so far as a family.

What a change I have witness at the polynesian plaza (now residences) We stayed here for 2 nights a few years ago & without mixing words-it was a dump!But now......what an amazing surprise upon arrival! Completely renovated to a much higher standard.....The pictures on the website are acurate! The location has always been the main factor but now the rooms have caught up.....Decor-bedding-bathrooms are all modern ,clean & well looked after. The large screen tv was an added bonus....the old run down elevator has been replaced with a modern one but still only the one. We stayed in a front (street) facing room & the room was relatively quiet to the noise outside so the soundproofing was upgraded as well. Big large bedside tables as well as a nice bedside clock just added to the enjoyment of our room but to our amazement the bathroom had a Bidet toilet.....Can't think of 1 other hotel that has this luxury! We also hired a car & parked a block away....this was a blessing in waikiki & we had no problem at all-I would only recommend you hire a compact car...parking was tight.....alittle pricey but we always had a guaranteed spot! Perfect!just a couple of little annoyances....we stayed 6 nights & the pool was not available to us as it was being refilled.....not sure why- 90 most days so it would of been nice. Also we booked our room well in advance and asked for a high floor pool facing room but upon arrival none was available (it's always the little things)At any rate we loved our stay & will be back & really that says it all!!

Firstly, the hotel is a little tricky to find but we just asked around the shops nearby and shortly after located where we needed to be. Would suggest Google mapping it first so you know what you're looking for. I agree with the other reviewers in that the lobby/reception area needs a facelift. It doesn't look pleasant or welcoming which is a shame because the staff and rooms themselves are great. We were welcomed with cold towels, which was refreshing. Our studio double was comfortable, modern and clean. Air conditioning worked well and was quiet. The traffic was a little loud but if you want location then you can't really avoid this.
