The Common areas & Meeting space is under renovation and they will be lovely when done but the rooms are sub-par. pricey for what you get. be sure to ask about all the extra fees they tack on to published room rate. Staff is not always friendly. Alleged ocean view is a long way away thru the other buildings and not worth additional charge. Kona rooms are the worst. Noisy, small, sometimes smelly, poorly maintained. Feels like a Motel 6. the only thing missing is the sani strip on the toilet. it is conveniently located near Ala Moana Shopping center.

We asked if we could pay for an upgraded room because the one we were given was horrible, and we had just got engaged, however they wouldn’t let us change rooms. Long walk to Waikiki, with nil access to free shuttles. For the same price/ cheaper you can stay at Ohana East on wakikki, which is in a better location, bigger and nicer rooms and beds and includes free shuttles to Ala Moana.If you are a young couple or family (especially from Australia) please do not stay here.","Anaheim, California","Shaylee6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anaheim, California</strong>",0,1.0

The staff at the Ala Moana were very helpful. There's even a scuba diving shop, a car rental, starbucks, and convenience store inside of the hotel. I an my husband did some scuba diving with ODA Scuba Store there. I think the scuba store really adds a nice touch to the hotel's image.

When I got here they told me for the first time ever that my room was subcontracted so I could not ask for amenities. They gave me a 24 hours service number. Fine, but the service number is not 24 hours. It is closed and if you contact them they take 72 hours to respond. I need a blanket right now. This room has no blanket and because of the pandemic all the stores nearby are closed and I can't even go out and buy one. Another thing is that the so-called concierge told me the beach ACROSS THE STREET was closed only to cars but not individuals. How could he not know what the main attraction of the hotel was? I went there and of course it was closed to individuals. The security kicked me out right away. Why did this hotel concierge not know such a basic thing?

I got a corner room this time, which was a bit on the smaller side, but I didn't mind since it was still nice. My only complaint is they need to get rid of some of their older sheets.

Besides the mall, the appeal for me is the proximity to Ala Moana beach park across the street. A nice place for a morning jog or a stroll to see the sunset.The hotel itself is a bit dated, with inefficient elevators and parking garage equipment. The garage is dingy and spaces are scarce if you arrive too late in the evening. The gym is well-equipped, with wet and dry saunas, if they're working.",,blokototerminous,93,3.0

We had several hours free in the middle of the day and I asked what she recommended we do. She literally said ""this time of day, nothing. There is nothing you can do."" I guess because there were no Expedia tours available, she was unable or unwilling to think past that. She didn't even mention the mall right next door, or the Honolulu Zoo (that's what we did, plenty of time for that), or the Waikiki Aquarium, or any one of several other smaller trips - there is a ton to do there.

The partial oceanview was blocked by 2 tall high rise buildings and had a side view of the ocean if you peered down the right side of the balcony.The bathroom shower was mouldy and the drain was always clogging up.

We were staying at this property under a medical emergency that involved our newborn. Disappointed that the manager offered to help and didn’t deliver, we decided the best thing to do was go back to the Hospital so my wife can pump and continue to provide breastmilk for our sick baby.On 12/14/19 Front Office Manager Joe had reached out to confirm that our room was mistakenly “checked out” around 2pm the day before.  This was confirmed through room lock audit. Joe mentioned that the assistance of the Director of Front Office Rena would need to be involved to make a decision on how this would be fixed. Director of Front Office mentioned that.“With the situation being as sensitive as it is, we wouldn’t extend/accommodate you for further disappointment... You are in a personal situation that our hotel staff is not making any easier for you and your situation.  At the rate of disappointment, we wouldn’t want to frustrate you further...” this conversation has been legally recorded. I would be more understanding if any damages, altercations, or any rule breaking were acted from our behalf. Never once did we raise our voice, cause a disruption or disrespected the staff when this all occurred. I’m understanding that service breaks happen, however my understanding is because of the negligence of a house keeper, it led to the loss of our personal items, then the hotel did not have a strategy to fix it and decided it was in their best interest to dismiss and inform us we were no longer welcome as their guests. Although the Director did approve a refund and delivered a breast pump to us at the hospital the next day, the thought process and execution in resolving is uncaring and flat out wrong as the burden and entirety of all service breaks were at fault from the staff at Ala Moana Hotel. A poorly written email was sent to me as an apology and gesture to replace our items from General Manager Glen Erickson. I returned his email taking him up on the gesture yet after 2 weeks he has ignored my response. Please beware in staying at this property. From my personal experience, if the staff makes a mistake (which I understand happens sometimes) they lack the capacity to help and will ask you to not be their guest and ignore you. It’s unfortunate that they can treat anyone this way, during the holidays, and while going through a medical emergency.

I wasn't expecting a resort experience, given the rate and given the location that is sort of urban grungy (try walking the Atkinson-Kapiolani area beyond Ala Moana mall, especially at night). My low expectations weren't even met. Parking for a few minutes in front to check-in, I got attitude from the valet staff (I opted for self-park, not valet). The self park lot was a grimy labyrinth with poor signage, rutted pavement and sewer smells near the exit. The elevator to the lobby from the parking garage was filthy and smelly. My room keys failed in the tower elevators repeatedly, requiring multiple replacements. My room in the ""Kona Tower"" was comically small - the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in on four continents. It abounded in examples of underinvestment and neglect. Rusted fire sprinklers. A floor lamp with no working knob. An ice receptacle with grime/rust on the bottom. Dirt spots under the glass covering the multiple table tops. Dust on and rips in a lamp shade. Wall lamps hanging very visibly out of plumb. A lamp held together with tape. A shower control with no indication of hot or cold. A shower head covered with soap scum and grime. The one blanket on the bed was hardly any thicker than the sheet, and there were no additional linens provided. There was a big yellow stain on the blanket (urine?). The mattress was tired and unsupportive. The closet had those old school hotel-only hangers that are such a pain to use. And so on. It's amazing to me how many points of failure there were in just the room. It's like nobody *ever* does quality inspection on the rooms, or at least the lower price rooms. Or perhaps the management just doesn't care how run down and dirty the rooms are. As I said initially, I stayed on a low corporate rate and wasn't expecting a resort experience. However, I do take resort vacations and have stayed at properties run by Four Seasons, Pan Pacific, Waldorf Astoria, Hyatt, Marriott, InterContinental, Starwood, MGM, etc. This experience at Ala Moana Hotel ensures that I'll never consider the property for vacation travel.

And Third, Magic Island is right across the street. A great park that has been cleaned up quite a bit. Waikiki beach is an easy walk, maybe half a mile. If that's too far for you there are bikes, uber, taxi's, trolley's and busses that can get you there very easily. And, just in case the reviewer with the mold issue is reading this, we flew in from Japan so we understand how it feels after a long flight.

How about look at the air vent directly above front desk where every guest checks in? What is that discoloration by the vents? Gee....didn't notice that either? I zoomed out so you can see that was indeed taken at the front desk. Got my money back from the hotel and was left to find another hotel in the middle of Waikiki so ended up having to spend more money.

The whole booking process was awful as it was supposed to be a 50% deposit through Booking.com, however I was charged 100%, and even worse this was done twice. So my credit card maxed out and I missed several Direct Debits at home due to Airpads mistake, which I might add was over $5,000 AUD. I received would sounded more like and excuse than an apology and was given no compensation. So long before we had even left we had feared we made a massive mistake. We arrived at the hotel and around 10pm and I have to say first impressions were mixed, it was a lovely big hotel in a great location, however the air conditioner was broken in the lobby and they had portable units doing the job, so it had a slightly musty smell. The front desk staff were fantastic, check-in was easy, they sorted daily room cleaning (Not included in some airpads rooms) and had us up to our rooms in no time. The rooms were very nice, nice simple decor, clean and spacious, and the view from the balcony was pretty good. The bed was comfortable and big, the TV was a good size and easy to use, and the bar fridge was very handy. The aircon worked well but was very noisy, I complained and a technician was sent up to inspect the problem, he did make it a bit quieter but didn't eliminate the noise completely. It was a slight annoyance but not enough that we couldn't sleep through it or watch TV etc.The pool was nice and big and the pool staff were very friendly and helpful, the staff in the lobby were very helpful with tour and transport information as well. The starbucks and convenience store in the lobby were also very nice to have. The hotel is in great location, very close to the Ala Moana shopping centre, across the road from a nice beach and getting a taxi or uber from the hotel is easy.Despite my fears and initial disappointment in the smell the Ala Moana was a great hotel with lovely staff and pleasent rooms.

I would have never imagined that a large Convention Centre would be built right across and up the street from here which was why I ended up staying here yet again; to attend a conference with my boss. The hotel does not seem to have changed much all these years other than being even more crowded. The rooms look pretty much the same, but with new aqua blue and green tones (carpet, bedding, cushions) added to the wooden furniture to give it a more tropical feel since its refurbishment in 2016. It is strange that I had actually remembered the rooms to be bigger; perceptions of dimensions seem to alter with age and perspective. I did feel though that the decor was rather plain and that more could have been done to make the look and feel more upbeat and classy. I was also a tad disappointed with the bathroom as it seemed still rather old-school and I had some issues with the hot water in the shower. I was thankful that the front desk offered me a courtesy room to use to freshen up after my long flight, since the hotel was running at peak and we could not check in any time before 2 pm. I was offered an ocean view room with a balcony in the Waikiki Tower, similar to the type of room we were allocated under contract with my former company. I always loved the gorgeous views out to the ocean on the right and with the mountains on the back left. Sitting out in the balcony with such amazing views and watching the sunset was a real treat. With the close-to-perfect Hawaiian weather, late evenings out on the balcony in a dream destination was truly a delight for a teen/young adult. On this trip however, we stayed at the Kona Tower, which although had partial views of the ocean, lacked a balcony. The Plantation Cafe where the daily buffet breakfast is served has shrunk from its original size and no longer offers full day dining but is only open for breakfast. The access to it is now from the outside of the hotel lobby. I remembered that we used to get the best ever corned beef hash here which was disappointingly no longer available. But I did still get to enjoy the fragrantly delicious Hawaiian papaya which remains as the most popular offering in the buffet spread. The most interesting discovery here was 'The Signature Prime Steak & Seafood' restaurant on the 36th floor, where the views are spectacular, with excellent food choices. There are also a few nice gift shops on the ground floor and a convenience store along with Starbucks. There is a little shop that sells original Hawaiian-designed and Hawaiian-made shirts and blouses; quite the real deal with a very friendly owner. The hotel is ideally located and conveniently linked by a ‘Skybridge’ on the second floor to the Ala Moana Center, the world’s largest open-air shopping center, through the car park area. It has far more upmarket stores and restaurants than before with the supermarket shifted right to the far end of the mall. There are a slew of restaurants to choose from and daily Hawaiian performances at the Centerstage. The artificially created Magic Island and Lagoon along with Ala Moana Beach Park are a short walk away. This is a good spot to watch surfers with an excellent view of Diamond Head, Kahanamoku Lagoon and Ala Wai Boat Harbor.","Singapore, Singapore","Ophir77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",63,4.0

Now I realize why it was one of the few available for the government per diem rate. I wouldn’t stay here again. Most of the staff at the front reception desk are rude, have a bad attitude and could care less about providing quality service. I was told when I checked in that they would charge my credit card upfront for all 4 nights. I was staying one day at my own expense so I had them charge that night to a different credit card. When I told them I was not staying that 4th night they issued the refund to the wrong credit card. I told them on two occasions to make sure and apply the credit to the Am Ex, but needless to say they messed that up. Clearly they didn’t listen. After I returned it took me 2 phone calls and 3 emails to get it corrected. Thankfully Beatrice in billing did care about providing good service even though the manager Chris did not. Seriously, what is wrong that it took that much of my time to correct their error which could’ve been avoided in the first place if the people at the front desk cared more about providing quality customer service. For the night I stayed on my own I checked into a different, nicer hotel. There was no way I was paying to stay at this hotel another night. The difference between this hotel and the other one I stayed at was night and day. The other things I didn’t like is the rooms don’t have balconies. It looked like it in the photo, but it’s bars over a sliding glass door that only opens about 5 inches. Ridiculous not to have a balcony when in a tropical climate. It also looks closer to the ocean than it is. Normally the rooms have information about where the fitness center and pool are located, ice machines etc. None of that information was in my room so I was always calling down to the desk to get that information. When I called from my room to ask the location of the fitness center I was told it was on a particular floor but that floor didn’t exist and wasn’t an option on the elevator. I had to go all the way to lobby to ask someone. Again, poor service from the front desk. When I asked the bell boy about shuttles to Waikiki he clearly had an I don’t care attitude and said “outside the shopping center”. That’s a pretty broad statement if you know Ala Moana center. It’s huge. If in Hawaii I will NOT ever stay at this hotel again. Grant it, the room was clean but there’s more to a hotel than a clean room. The fact that it didn’t have a balcony was a deal breaker. When you combine that with very poor customer service in every aspect it makes it pretty poor.","Minneapolis, MN","lovetoboogieboard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, MN</strong>",16,2.0

I was attending a conference at the Holoulu convention center and the usual official hotel assigned by the conference was sold out so I booked at A la Moana hotel last minute.This is an apartment hotel which means the suites are owned by someone but they rent them either privately or through the hotel organization. I arrived at 5:30am and the checkin was at 4pm and there were no rooms available. There was a $50 extra charge for early checkin but there were simply no rooms available even for early checkin. I found some reception staff very friendly and accommodating and some other ones very dry and not so friendly. It helps to talk to the manager. I left my luggage with the concierge until my room became available. I had booked a room with ocean view. This hotel has 36 floors. The first room I got was on the 8th floor and even though it did look towards the ocean,the view was that of the mall's parking lot. I complained and the next day got a room on the 18th floor. This time, the view was quite lovely so try to get a room on higher floors. The suite has a small bedroom and a good size living room/kitchenette/dining area. The kitchen has basic dishes and cutlery for 4 people, dishwasher, 2 fridges, cook top and microwave. The decor is pretty basic, boring and dated but the view makes up for it. The sliding doors in the sitting room open completely and you feel like you are sitting at the beach.The wifi speed is good in the room and free. The bathroom has a bathtub and good water pressure. The water is safe to drink and has no smell. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. There's a Starbox in the lobby that comes in handy. There's also a direct bridge from second floor of the hotel to the adjacent huge shopping mall. The elevators work with room keys when going up and it can sometimes get tricky as the key may not be read properly and it can be frustrating.There's a cafe that serves breakfast. It's average breakfast with a wide variety of choices.The best part of this hotel is its proximity to the convention center if you are staying for business. It's literally down the street and 2 minutes walk. It's also right by the A la Moana shopping center and a 5 minute walk to the beach. I took the airport shuttle bus to the hotel that cost only $15 on the way in. On the way back, I took a cab that cost $40 for the same distance to the airport. He charged me 60c ents for each bag!Overall a good stay, nothing fancy but the view is breathtaking and it's practical and close to several amenities.","London, Canada","busypassport</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Canada</strong>",13,3.0

We were requested to pay another tariff which, frustrated and tired, we agreed. A room was found in minutes at the higher room rate. From then we used the hotel a bed only as the café was less than average and then principally open for breakfast. Starbucks situated on the premises was unusual but saved the day providing a drink on occasion and at least a snack with pleasant staff. The main problem was the noise each vehicle makes as it enters the carpark directly under the room windows - such that to sleep with the door open with even the narrowest of slots open, was impossible. A very minor repair to the covers to the drains in the carpark would solve the problem. When I reported the noise problem, I was told that the hotel was attending to the problem. The cab driver said it had been occurring for months without resolution.

This gave us the freedom to come and go as we pleased during our stay which was very convenient for us. The hotel has a variety of shops in the lobby that came in quite handy during our stay. The free wifi turned out to be a bit spotty from time to time, but when it worked, it was very good. The only thing we didn't care for was the expensive buffet breakfast. In the other hotels we stayed in, they offered a generous, free continental breakfast, but at Ala Moana, you're expected to pay upwards of $18.

We first stayed here (in the Waikiki Tower) in November 2016 and were impressed enough with our experience that we have been waiting to book here again- our family set us up in different hotels on subsequent visits.Because we were treated so well in our previous visit, and the room was so nice, when we had the opportunity to choose Ala Moana we booked our 10 day stay here once again, figuring that our second stay would be as nice as our previous stay, especially since we were spending more money for the same level of quality. In fact I was so happy with our previous treatment, that I brought a gift package I put together in Maine along for the person who set us up so well and was so kind to me on the phone while I booked this special yearly trip!When we arrived after our 13+ hour trip, there was no ""Thank you for staying with us again"" (as with other hotels in the area) and we were given a much lower quality room- right in front of elevators ( one of the first things I ask to avoid), with a much smaller - bathroom and multiple dings and dents in the walls - very obvious wear and tear. I was stunned, and not in a good way.After flying for over 13 hours, this was a huge let-down. I asked for a nicer room, one comparable to the one we had last time, and we were again given a room close to elevators, one floor up from the original dumpy room, but thankfully in much better condition, with less (apparent) wear and tear. I need to add that we were spending much more at this point for a less nice room than before. We settled for this room and were told it had been upgraded to an ""ocean view"". Let me just refer the reader at this point to my Nov. 2016 last review and photos of the Partial Ocean View - it was re-classified, not upgraded as we had way less of an ocean view than before. Same floor, much further away from the ocean, definitely a partial not a full. This was no upgrade. In the sunlight you could see multiple, ""slapdash"" and uneven paint brush strokes, and smudges on the ceiling and over the doors. For a cheaper room, this could be over looked, but some of us save and budget for a nice experience and when it falls short, we feel cheated.The front desk was only kind early on when I asked to change rooms, but when checking out the man could not have been colder or more disinterested. No customary ""How was your stay"", or 'Thank you for staying with us"". I waited a moment for him to at least say ""Thanks or have a nice trip home"" ...He just gave me a blank stare and said exactly: "" Do you want a printed receipt, or what?"" Not what I expected after spending US$3000.00 on a NON-beach front, mid-range three star hotel.Also not once was there an acknowledgement of the gift bag from Maine I brought - so I'm not even certain it made it to the right person.What a disappointment. I spent a lot of time choosing fun goodies from Maine that I thought she would like. I was so bothered by this whole lackluster experience that when we were waiting for the valets to bring our car, I popped back in and mentioned how disappointed I was with my experiences here to the concierge. She apologized, took my name and room number, and I expected a call or an email from management to ask me more, but none came in 4 days --hence this review. I always give a business the chance to make things better before leaving a negative review, and again, Ala Moana fell very short.The lobby and especially the second floor where it opens to the shopping center had a strong sour, odd moldy/bathroom smell. The pool looked sketchy, with black mold stains on the surrounding floor.Lastly, the elevators are in serious need of repair, there was one that kept breaking and stalling during our stay and they would get so crowded that it was an ordeal coming and going.Sadly I would have to recommend that if you travel 5000+ miles for a treasured, special vacation, that you definitely consider other hotels.This is a very poor value, overpriced for the level of service and quality of rooms.The positives: Excellent housekeeping serviceExcellent valet serviceProximity to shopping and downtown amenitiesStarbucks in the lobbyPartial Ocean View ( but please do NOT call it a full ocean view when partially blocked by two or more buildings)","Portsmouth, New Hampshire","earlybean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, New Hampshire</strong>",39,2.0

But there's a $2 shuttle bus from Ala Moana shopping center to Waikiki. And it's the proximity next door to the shopping center and its food court, as well as to Ala Moana beach park across the street, that is the main appeal of the hotel.The hotel has been refurbished over the years, but what it calls ""partial ocean view"" in the high-rise Waikiki Tower is an overly generous term for a sliver of a view of the water in the distance, with a view mostly that of the rooftops of surrounding parking garages. There is also a low-rise wing with no view. As for the furnishings, it's puzzling how the designers could choose desk chairs that are heavy and difficult to position at the desk -- they can't slide over the carpet, so are almost useless. In stark contrast to the modern lobby above it, the underground parking garage does not appear to have ever been refurbished and is poorly lit and dark and feels unsafe at night, particularly since anyone, even non-guests, can enter the garage through the lobby. in addition, the garage floor is oddly inclined and unevenly surfaced. It's a big, busy hotel, and woe unto anyone who arrives at the same time as the tourist buses or airline crews, with long lines stretching through the lobby -- the longest lines I've ever seen in a hotel. The crowds might help to explain the impersonal, unhelpful, and sometimes unfriendly attitude of the reception staff, a far cry from the ""aloha"" spirit experienced in other hotels in Hawaii.Dining options are very limited, with a ground floor cafe open only in the mornings for a pricey breakfast and a Starbucks in the lobby, plus a high-end steakhouse on a top floor. The pool area is a bare, unlandscaped concrete feature, while the gym is nicely equipped. Upon checkout, the hotel e-mails a questionnaire to guests, but a guest's uncomplimentary remarks, however constructive and well-intentioned, can result in a snarky reply from the hotel.

I don’t like complaining on the internet, and that’s simply not my style. Therefore, instead of penning a scathing complaint on Yelp, which ultimately does little or nothing to fix your problem that I left very unsatisfied, I took the time to dig through my e-mails in order to find this survey and file my complaint using the proper channel.FYI, I was initially offered free breakfast to alleviate my complaints, but since I already purchased breakfast, the night manager authorized a $50 refund. I would like to clarify that this is not about the money: this is about providing proper customer service to a loyal client that left the property feeling like his needs were ignored, even after receiving a refund. Your refund was a solemn gesture at best. The following were the complaints stated to the night manager.1. Reception at 7 pm did not recognize mantra+ membership nor online promotional code until after I insisted they were undoubtably part of my booking.2. 2nd room key programmed incorrectly, requiring going back down to lobby to reprogram. Receptionist stated that static from clothes and phones tends to foul keys, but this explanation makes little sense. The elevator worked fine. This is the first issue with keycards in 4 stays in the same month, with multiple keys being next to my phone (iPhone X) and wearing similar clothes. The attempt to shift blame on user error with a weak excuse was not cool, and should not be protocol at your hotel. 3. Tub clogged, water instantly backed up upon start of shower. 4. Wi-Fi Internet out of operation. Upon 430 am call to guest services, operator informed me that a technician would need to be sent to the room to troubleshoot the issue. I informed her that this was impossible, since my ladyfriend was trying to sleep and was getting progressively irritated that i was trying to troubleshoot the internet. I told operator that I was familiar with the correct steps to reset a cable internet modem, and would attempt to do so, and thanks. Unfortunately, doing that did not resolve the problem. The internet was not available until after 9 am. These are things that should have been taken care of during routine maintenance. All of these issues should have been resolved for this room regardless if there was an occupant or not. I hope you will use this message to place more efforts into doing better. Providing shoddy service with NYE up-charge was wrong. Please feel free to email me or contact me using my phone number on file. Thank you for your time.-Jeff",,Road55253130350,1,1.0

Arriving on the 8th December, I was turned away - as expected - for trying to check in early. That's fine. But, returning at 3pm as requested, I found a long queue. By the time I got to the head of the queue, 50 minutes had passed. And, looking at the queue behind me, it had grown to twice the length that it was when I joined.No extra check-in staff had been drafted in. No seating or water was offered to those queueing, nor any apologies form the check-in staff. Many people in that queue would have been running the marathon the next day. As one of those runners, I can tell you that I’d rather have spent that time resting than standing idle - having to do so was extremely aggravating. The only member of staff to clothe herself in any glory was the kindly security lady who routinely walked the line thanking people for their patience while ensuring the queue didn’t snake in any unwanted direction.Ala Moana is the most desirable accommodation in Honolulu at the time of the marathon due to its proximity to the race start line. The hotel should not rest on these laurels. The marathon is a well-publicised event that the hotel’s management is aware of. Extra check-in staff should have been scheduled to work the day before the marathon (and probably two or three days prior to that), and check-in times should have been staggered throughout the day to ease the process.",,Q1725VKmatthewr,3,2.0

Self parking is $20/day and worth it given the difficulty in finding parking in Honolulu, and also worth it if you want to explore more of Oahu than where the buses can take you.The line to check in was looooong but I'm sure it was because this was the most popular hotel to stay at for the convention we were going to. It was also really warm on the ground level and there were portable A/C units running which I thought was weird. No central A/C for such a large hotel? What's up with that? I later found out from one of the merchants that they are renovating the entire A/C system on the ground floor but the actual rooms do have central A/C.

Wifi is free which is another perk, and they also allow you to print out your boarding passes for free, otherwise they charge by the minute and by page if you use the business center. The A/C in the room worked really well and was easily adjustable to your own comfort level.Noise level in the room was good. I didn't hear anything from my neighbors or from anyone in the hallways.Service was always friendly here from housekeeping to the front desk staff.The shower head and knob seemed a bit antiquated but I had no problems using it.I would definitely stay here again if I were to attend another event at the Hawaii Convention Center due to the good service, location and reasonable rates.",,KarenZoo,32,4.0

I arrived from Ko Olina which took around half an hour by car.The first thing you’ll notice on entering the lobby is the heat. There’s something wrong with the A/C so there are a dozen portable units and industrial sized fans throughout. It isn’t terribly uncomfortable but you will notice it.Check in was pretty fast and easy and although I was well ahead of check in time, my room was available. As a Mantra Plus member I was also given a couple of bottles of water.The ‘Mountain/City’ view room in the Kona Tower met the expectations I had based on how much I paid. Small, dated and view of an adjacent office block and car park. The bed was small, with only two pillows and a thin comforter. The bathroom is much the same although it had been retiled in the last few years. The shower is over the bath and has adequate pressure. A/C works well and is quiet.The room comes with an empty mini fridge, microwave, coffee machine and safe in the wardrobe.The pool area on the 4th floor is a little sad. The pool itself is small and the whole area seems very under utilised. It was never very busy during my stay. There is no food or beverage service at the pool either, but the towel attendants were always friendly and helpful. Despite the area being marked as smoke free the area was littered with cigarette butts. It’s a shame Mantra haven’t tried to make this area more inviting. It could easily be as great as a Vegas resort pool with a little investment. The gym is adjacent to the pool, open from 5AM. There are a dozen or so cardio machines, weight machines and free weights. Though dated, the equipment was in good condition. During my stay it was only busy first thing in the morning but relatively quiet otherwise. My rate included breakfast at the Plantation Cafe. A standard hotel buffet breakfast setup. I never waited for a table early in the morning and the staff were friendly and helpful. There is no bar. Whilst this is by no means a problem, it is unusual and I think goes to explain a lack of atmosphere. My overall impression of the Ala Moana Hotel is that it needs investment. With office printed signage and leaflets the place seems rather amateur. If you like to shop, it could be a good option given its direct access to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre.Waikiki is about a 20-30 minute walk or 5 minute ride.If I was on a budget I’d consider staying again, but generally this isn’t a hotel I’d rush back to.","Sydney, Australia","Sheamus_81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",194,3.0

The hotel's location is perfect, and while it's not a ""beach"" hotel in the traditional sense, it is an excellent ""city"" hotel--central to virtually all of the major attractions within the heart of Honolulu. Our room, while not ocean facing, did have an ocean view on a high floor which was better than expected. The room itself was quite spacious, clean, comfortable and very functional. We were in and out a lot and so didn't have too much interaction with the staff, but those that we did deal with were great: helpful, friendly and courteous. And of course if you either need or want to shop, the hotel being immediately adjacent to the Ala Moana mall is ideal. The mall is massive and features just about everything imaginable from amazing restaurants to high-end designer shops. We didn't have a car this time, so I cannot comment on the hotel parking, but we took lyft everywhere and the hotel had super easy access for pickups and drop offs. Overall, the Ala Moana made our stay in paradise even better. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.","San Francisco, California","Davidstandard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",35,5.0

We were paying about half what our colleagues in another very nice hotel were paying so for 4 nights it was a great deal. Our only complaints are we were given one roll of toilet paper for the entire stay and check in took forever. The former was easily resolved by purchasing some more supplies at the well stocked general store on the first floor. The latter is probably a software problem. It was taking about 12 minutes per booking to check guests in when we arrived at 2:45 for our not earlier than 3 pm condo check in. Fortunately they had nearly all stations open though one was flight crew only. We thought it might make sense to check in regular guests when no flight crews were present but the guy at the desk just pretended to be busy until another crew showed up. We had almost an hour to watch the process before we were able to check in. We were warmly greeted and given a detailed and personal explanation of the hotel, amenities and surrounding area plus the numerous exclusions for condo guests. Certainly that takes some time. Still, it sure seemed to take a lot longer than necessary. Definitely check out the very classy restaurant and lounge on the top floor. Stunning views and the best lava flow I've had since the Shipwreck Bar at Kona Village. ","Missoula, Montana","Shawn M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Missoula, Montana</strong>",56,4.0

The front desk did not have our reservation. They called Airpads while I waited and couldn't figure it out. After 3 hours, Airpads stated it was a system error and they booked the wrong name... their booking agent's name! Not how I wanted to start my vacation. Then more bad news. I learned they are 1/5 companies that contracts 10% of the rooms and rents them out like an AIRBNB. But they are the ONLY company that puts all the charges on their customers!!! That means they charged us $25 resort fees per night and $50 booking fee which the hotel charges them. The only company that does that!!! Shady! in the end I paid hundreds more than if I booked through the hotel.

However it took 45 min to check in because there was a lot of people there for the festival and I think that is very long to wait. Room was clean and comfortable, we had a small kitchenette which was good so you can refrigerage left overs and heat them up in the micro. You do have to request a kitchen pack which include dishes, utensils, pans, cutting board, knife, etc. The first day they were out but I managed to get one from the second day. I think those things should already be in the room but then to run out is disappointing. I also wondered why they only have towel sets for 3 people (and not 4 like the norm) especially because we had a suite and we said there was 4 people when we booked. So I ended up having to call for towels for 3 days. Other than that, staff was friendly, wi-fi was good and no major issues. Would stay again next year for the same festival.

They opened the restaurant so everyone could eat when nothing else in the area was open, provided free movies with juice and popcorn for the kids, set up a game room, and scheduled some hula performances to keep us occupied.

The only issue we had was the plumbing sounds. If someone was to flush the toilet or take shower you would hear it through the walls. My wife and I was awaken from a deep sleep around 1:30 am because the sounds of the plumbing through the walls were so loud. This wasn't a one time thing either. It was almost every night for our week stay. Although it was a bit of a nuisance it didn't ruin our stay. It was 5 min walk to the Ala Moana Center (Mall) which was great for my wife because her shopping needs were fulfilled from a short distance. Waikiki beach was about a 10 to 15 min walk from the hotel and most of the restaurants were within a mile to two mile radius from the Ala Moana hotel. We rented a vehicle for a week and even though the hotel provides parking, it was $20 per day and some nights it was almost impossible to find parking cause it would fill up fast. If I had to do it all over I would not rent a vehicle instead I would use uber or lyft. You'll save a lot money from rental and parking fees. Only rent on days you feel like traveling around the island. As for the hotel, the staff was very curtious and friendly, the rooms were comfy, and the location was perfect for us because most places we visited were within walking distance.

I also didn’t know this room was had a fully handicap bathroom, could have been my fault when I made reservations?

BUT if you are interested in Waikiki, it is between the downtown area and Waikiki, so it has the best of both worlds.- Right beside Ala Moana Mall, in case you need to do some shopping or if you want to have dinner. (There is a walkway at the second level parking lot outside Macy's that connects the mall to the second level of Ala Moana Hotel)- Has a Starbucks inside, a reasonably-priced convenience store, and some souvenir stores - Has a very good travel desk. Our travel agenct Malia made it a breeze for us to book day trips to Pearl Harbor and the Polynesian Cultural Center even before setting foot in Hawaii!!- There are always taxis lined up outside the hotel in case you don't have a car or did not rent a car, or if you don't want to use travel apps. (Taxis are hard to find in Hawaii.)- Very near bus stops and trolley stops - Easy to get deals for cheap but good rooms (like my family did!!) - Has full amenities including free wifi.Cons:- If you really really want the Waikiki beach scene then this hotel might not be for you.- The hotel is a bit dated, but I personally think that it's kept up to date. It was well-kept and clean when we stayed.- Not really a ""con"" but more like a reminder: the travel desk opens from 7am-6pm if I'm not mistaken, so if you wish to talk to someone before or after these hours, you won't find anyone. But I also understand that these are the times when people are usually outdoors. So in case you're interested, it's probably best to e-mail or call the travel desk for concerns beforehand, or just make sure that you're at the travel desk between these hours so you can talk to someone.****Overall my family and I had a pleasant stay.

There is a self-serve laundry but they do not provide dishes/pans/flatware for the kitchens. Nice pool area and many rooms have a view of the marina at Ala Moana Park across the street.

Nothing fancy, but I was only looking for a place to lay my head . It was an easy walk to the beach, followed by an hour by their nice pool, and a half hour cab ride back to the airport .

READ the fine print! $25/day for “resort fee”. Resort??? I don’t think so!!! Also a $50 one time “hotel fee”! Then again it is in the fine print but still deceptive as it adds onto the price advertised. I stayed here for a medical appt at Queens and wanted a clean, quiet place. I was put in a nicely decorated room but with construction starting at 4:00 am next door, it really sucked! Had to use my noise cancelling headphones to sleep. Also the carpet and tile had not been cleaned. A chunk of woman’s hair in the bathroom floor, hair pins on the carpet and hair on the bathroom counter. I Never bother for room service as you have to call a separate company and room cleaning is 25/day!!!! Room which I stayed in is managed by Airpads. It is also privately owned.....

Within 24 hours of our stay on the tenth floor, our toilet over flowed & flooded our room!! Fortunately minimal belongings were on the floor & contaminated with bio hazardous materials. The maintenance guys were fantastic & at our room mopping up with their bare hands with 10 minutes. The second in charge of the hotel, Jason was very good & assisted with relocation & control over the situation. The hotel manager, polly, who had poor English, was terrible to deal with. She had no idea of what to do, how to deal with a distressed & hysterical guest in such a situation & asked me, 'what do you want me to do about it'. She sat me crying in the foyer late on a Friday afternoon with hundreds of other hotel guests watching on! It was so unprofessional & disgraceful management of the situation to say the least!The hotel staff & management had NO idea about OHS, WHS or anything to do with biohazard contamination. I had to beg for latex gloves & shower caps for shoe covering for protection to enter our room safely & pack everything up! The manager just said to me, 'just start packing your room up, we will relocate you'. The only positive outcome of the situation was the hotel upgraded us to the 23rd floor with balcony & king bed. Our $25 a day US dollar valet parking was waived & we got a complementary breakfast. Upon making a travel insurance claim, we were informed we weren't covered & were advised to seek further compensation from the hotel. This was not forthcoming. Upon requesting a report of the incident from the motel, polly declined & requested I make a statement to security who were summonsed. They failed to give me a report number. Upon making this statement in the foyer of the hotel, the men's toilet next to the restaurant we had breakfast flooded with toilet water & faecal matter. My partner nearly vomited seeing the entire toilet floor flooded & people running out!! When speaking with staff further about the issues with the hotel toilets flooding, we were informed an incident of this nature would occur on a fortnightly basis & was certainly a common occurrence. The explanation as to the cause was rusted old hotel plumbing systems. Upon our return to Australia, our issues were directed back to flight centre agency directly. After some discussions back & forth between the Mantra Group, flight centre & Ala Moana Hotel, nothing further was forthcoming & everyone seemed to just pass the buck & throw it in the 'too hard' basket. Of note, my partner proposed to me on day four of our holiday which was unforgettable & so very special. The hotel had no idea or gave any concern & signatures restaurant management staff treated us as poorly as polly. It was such a disappointment having celebratory drinks from the top of the building on sunset only to be put on a piano as a table shared with 3 other guests & the pianist. Thank god our celebrations were continued elsewhere as the service was again disgraceful for such a special occasion. I'm giving the hotel 1/5 stars only for views from the restaurant on top of the building, room views we were upgraded to on the 23rd floor & customer service of the maintenance, cleaning & valet staff who worked so hard & were always friendly. I feel sorry that they have to work for such a poor employer.

We used a local holiday rental company to secure an amazing rate on a 2 bedroom apartment on a high floor - and i have to say that it could not have been a more amazing place to stay.The views were amazing - if you are facing the Hilton as we were, then you can even see the weekend fireworks from your Lanai (balcony). Otherwise - you have generally unobstructed views of the marinas, ocean, diamond head, and other mountain ranges to the north - it really does offer diverse views which will please most people.In terms of the Hotel itself - it offers everything that families require to ensure a safe, secure and relaxing visit. There are laundries available in the building (coin operated, but lets be fair, some hotels and resorts will charge you 18 dollars for 1 shirt....so a few bucks for a full load is great - and can be done at your own leisure (takes about 1 hour)The lobby has its own starbucks and adjoining restaurant, and only a few metres behind the check in desk, you will find a convenience store on site, offering fresh produce, packaged goods, a large variety of cold beverages, alcohol and specialty items. They also provide postal services, which is helpful for those from abroad.In terms of geography - you can gain access to the large Ala Moana shopping centre directly from the hotels grounds, or you can trek around the back streets to get to the carpark. In addition - the hotel is only a 200 or so metre walk to the Honolulu Convention Centre, and about a mile walk to the Central Waikiki area. If you arent keen on walking everywhere (Honolulu is PERFECT for walking however) - then you could head to the Ala Moana shopping centre and catch the Trolley to pretty much anywhere along the south coast, from Pearl Harbour to Diamond HeadLets be honest - you are staying here if you want a great bed to sleep in, a nice location central to pretty much everything, and easy public transport to attractions across the island. If you want the 'resort' experience, then head to Ko'olina and spend huge amounts of money on it - if you want to just stay in Honolulu and let the breeze carry you on your adventures, then stay here.

We were dog tired and the room was located on the 25th floor with an extraordinary view of the city, marina, Ala Moana Beach Park and I believe, even Magic Island. It was panoramic and immediately drew me into the room. The room was nicely appointed and not small or large. The bed was extremely comfortable; but the best part of this hotel was the staff and Plantation Cafe/staff. Everyone was very pleasant, helpful and kudos to Gregory up at the restaurant who made our arrival tremendously welcoming. The shopping center next to the hotel is a must-visit as it has an extensive food court and there are restaurants located on the top level - Mai Tai Bar which played the best reggae music on that Saturday night.

The hotel is attached to one end of it and accessible from a walkway over the car park to Macy's. It you are wanting close proximity to the mall then there is no better place to be. Personally, I prefer Waikiki itself and then uber to the mall but this is also close to the Ala Moana beach which is great although it doesn't have loungers/umbrellas to rent. It is the place the real Hawaiians go on a Sunday. The hotel is a large hotel that does the job, if the job is to be near the mall and not pay an arm and a leg to do it. My only criticism is the pool which could be so easily upgraded for easy and safe access ie it is like my school pool was with no steps into the pool for children or older/less active people - only the metal ladder type steps that are quite difficult for those pre-mentioned swimmers to use, especially in the 9' deep end where one descends into the depths. It would not be a difficult fix to put in concrete steps for easy access and for little children there is no real swimming area. It was clean and well appointed although i am not sure that I was in Hawaii - could have been anywhere in a big hotel. However would stay again under the circumstances.","Wellington, New Zealand","PeanutWellington</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",133,4.0

I had contacted staff quite a few times before we arrived in Hawaii to ensure that we would get a room with these features and then when my family came to the desk after waiting in a huge line they said unfortunately we couldn't receive any of these even after we paid and was told we would get these things. I ended up having to sleep on the 'couch' which was extremely hard, small and uncomfortable where my feet were hanging off the end. I only received a single thin blanket and no extra pillows for the couch. Then we also had toilet issues where on one occasion it had completely flooded the bathroom and rest of the room and despite being told that a plumber would come and fix the problem, it was never fixed and the water in the toilet kept rising to the top every time we used it and it did not flush properly, and after asking for the room to be mopped up and cleaned my family was told by staff that it happens quite frequently and is worse because they recently changed some piping. The carpet was wet for quite a while and also smelled. I did like the theme and the colours of the room, the location is fantastic, the Starbucks is great however the other café is not that good and overpriced (same as the restaurant on the top floor). One of the security staff was also quite rude and felt like he was being slightly racist. It was obvious because one night we were coming back and I saw he let in many of the Asian people staying at the hotel without checking their room cards or questioning them, but as soon as my family walked through to the lifts he angrily persisted to check our room cards. It made us feel very discriminated and was very embarrassing. The lines for checking in are shocking, not sure if that is because not enough staff are on. The pool closes way too early, could not enjoy going for a swim late at night after coming back from shopping. The pictures make the rooms look much bigger than they are. The rooms are actually quite small. Thank gosh they have free wifi because that was the only good thing. I think they could have had more Christmas decorations, they had a beautiful tree in the middle but that was it, and the rooms were clean. The biggest bonus and reason why I would stay again is only because the hotel is right beside one of the best shopping centre in Oahu and it is easy to grab dinner from the amazing restaurants at the top of the centre. It is not close to the beach or water but it only cost about 10-12$ for a taxi ride down to Waikiki Beach. They also have good bus services that can take you to the outlet mall and tours etc. They do not have a good variety of activities thou (example to see 4 museums at pearl harbour it cost about 200$+ per person) and so they did seem overpriced, so I recommend you book and find activities and tours online and then check if they can pick you up from the hotel.","Sydney, Australia","vivnik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",1,3.0

The two young men who helped me out at the front desk, Joe and Justin, were able to assist me during this visit with a smile, demonstrating the true meaning of Aloha. The manager, Daryl, was helpful when I needed it and the gentleman from housekeeping, who's name I never found out assisted me when I had a housekeeping issue. - Self parking is a plus, because I'm impatient and hate having to wait for someone to get my car when I'm ready to leave. - Location, it's great because it's just a short walk into Waikiki and connected to the largest outdoor mall on O'ahu. Cons:Cockroaches: On day 2 of being in my room, I found a cockroach on my ceiling. I've lived on O'ahu before so they're nothing new (when they're the large ones!) When you find the smaller/German cockroaches, there's not just one, there's hundreds or more. That same evening I found another cockroach on my dresser. As with the first I killed it and decided that I would notify the management the next day. When I notified the manager on duty, Daryl, it shocked me that he didn't seem too surprised by my discovery and had housekeeping sent to my room to clean it. (This is merely a band-aid because vacuuming the room will not rid it of my unwanted guests.) He agreed to me checking out more than a week early as well as refunding me, but only for the remaining days that I was supposed to stay. I was charged for the days that I'd already been there. When I got off the elevator to go up to meet the housekeeper, I found a cockroach crawling on the table in the hallway and then up the wall. The housekeeping manager was there and I showed it to him, his response was ""Oh a German cockroach."" After which he went and got a Kleenex, wiped it off the wall and proceeded to have the housekeeper clean my room. Again, his response was not one of surprise, but more a response that he was well aware that this is a problem. He also came into the room with the housekeeper, moved the mini fridge, placed a roach bait behind it and sprayed bug spray underneath it. I also took the spray and sprayed the perimeter of my room. The housekeeper did a great job of cleaning, but I was on edge for the next 2 nights that I had to stay until I was able to check into another hotel. On the morning of my checkout, I was headed downstairs and found another cockroach crawling on the door to the room directly across the hall. Needless to say, I got my belongings, shook them out and got out of there. - Size of the room: These rooms are tiny in comparison to many of the other resorts on island. Two people staying in one double bed room will literally be on top of one another. Summary:I typically leave excellent reviews for places, even if they aren't perfect because most often the staff makes the imperfections bearable. This situation was not the same, although the staff that did assist me were phenomenal, even their Aloha spirit couldn't make sleeping with cockroaches acceptable. If anyone from the hotel management reads this review, by all means please feel free to contact me. This hotel is in a wonderful location and honestly with a good deep cleaning could really become one of the premier resorts on island.","San Diego, California","Pulelehua323</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",16,2.0

First time to stay at this hotel.Last night, about 1.5cm (0.6 inch) roach came out from the drawer of TV cabinet. I called Housekeeper to bring a roach killer spray. 5-10mins later, a housekeeping lady came to bring it, but she explained to me I cannot keep it with me until I kill a roach as for the health hazard reason. It is acceptable but they should bring also ""a roach trap catcher(roach motel)"" instead. A hotel staff told me he could bring roach bites which cannot catch or kill roaches right away.I talked to a staff or a manager and he told me I could move to another room. But it was almost midnight and it was a long day for me and would not like to pack all my staffs to move to the another room.I texted about this happening to my friend who stayed at this hotel several times and she told me she found roaches few times. That means even if I move to another room, I might encounter with another one again....so I decided not to move.This hotel is not well pest control.I normally stay at Hyatt Regency in Waikiki or Moana Surfrider when I visit Honolulu once/twice times of every year for this past 10 years. I have never seen roaches in those hotels. The location of this hotel is excellent to access to Ala Moana SC. The service is not with the warm Aloha atmosphere.

There are rooms at the Ala Moana hotel that are privately owned and managed through AirPads. Although hotel personnel check you in and park your car, everything else is AirPads.

I called AirPads the next day and it was smooth sailing and the room was immaculate everyday thereafter. We were in room 3522 with an ocean view, king bed. Regardless of who you book with, parking at the hotel is $20 per day. For $25 per day, you get valet parking which is what we did. The savings was worthwhile because we knew what we were getting ourselves into. Also, no matter who you book with, an oceanview is not an oceanfront view. The hotel is not on the beach.

The Ala Moana staff were constrained servicing us as a result. Staff at the hotel were excellent and tried hard to overcome Luxury Suites deficiencies. The room first, was OK a little cramped as we had 2 beds in it and used only one. Room facilities were non existent we had to buy 2 cups just to have a cup of tea or coffiee. We donated these. There was coffee supplied for 3 cups of coffee. There was no kettle for boiling water and we had to use the coffee machine. No plates or bowels although it did have a microwave. The bathroom ceiling was mouldy and we found out why when it leaked water from the unit upstairs overflowing their bath. For someone who has a mould allergy this was not good. The door to the balcony did not lock but this was fixed within 24 hours but not straight away and we slept nervously for 2 nights. The bed we slept in... was ok but I found it broken on our last day when looking for something under it. My husband and family members got stuck in the lift at one point in our stay and this was stressful as I was stuck outside with limited information on their impending release. After that the lifts were a bit unreliable but you learnt to jump out quickly if it did not move. Now to the positive, the linen was clean and the room cleaned once during our stay was excellent. The girls really did put in some effort. The balcony was great and the view outstanding. The location of the hotel was the principle draw card being so close to amenities. The staff at the front reception were excellent and went well out of their way to help at every turn. They remained cheerful and helpful throughout.

Checked in Thursday, Thanksgiving afternoon. Used to be part of the Outrigger chain but now is part of an Australian company, Mantra. Registration staff was pleasant and had our room ready. We stayed in the Kona Tower which faces / overlooks the shopping center. So convenient as we did A LOT of shopping, returned to the room to drop off our spoils and then right back out again to spend more money. LOL. Stayed Thursday and checked out Saturday, two nights. Enough time to take advantage of all of the Black Friday deals. The room had a Queen bed, blackout curtains, was clean and spacious enough with minimum frills. Furniture is dated. Standard amenities ~ iron, ironing board, soap, facial tissue, shoe mit, hairdryer ~ but no shower cap, toothbrush or paste and no complimentary bottles of water. We had to ask for a shower cap and also for an extra blanket as the room got extremely cold overnight. When I called for the extra blanket it took two calls to housekeeping and 45 minutes for them to deliver it.This hotel is also convenient to Ala Moana Beach Park, a three minute walk and a great beach park for swimming and all water sports and for jogging or a leisurely stroll. Across of the Hawaii Convention Center and in walking distance to Waikiki. Want to head downtown? Many bus stops make it easy.Really, the only drawback for my wife and I was the extra blanket incident and no water bottles, both not really a big deal. I would recommend this hotel for any visitor to Honolulu.One last thing. Probably more irritating than the blanket incident. You need to insert your room card each time you go UP in the elevator. Insert quickly and when green light is on, press your floor number.

Jetlagged and sleep-deprived, all we wanted to do was take a shower and crawl under the sheets. But we had to follow the hotel's check-in time of 3PM. We passed the time by sightseeing and returned to the hotel at past 4PM. It was almost 5PM by the time we got to our respective rooms. Lo and behold, three out of four paid rooms have not been cleaned yet and were left by the former guests in total disarray. It made us wonder why those rooms were not cleaned yet when the hotel check-out time is 12NN and check-in time is 3PM. Then we discovered that due to its accessibility to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, this is the usual go-to hotel. It always on full-house booking, so the housekeeping people cannot cope with the number of rooms they have to clean everyday. Despite its high volume of guests, it seems like the hotel management is scrimping on hiring people. The housekeeping people could not properly clean the rooms. The carpets smell. The bathroom tiles have mildew. The frontline people are rude, arrogant, and ill-tempered. They are way too stressed out and could barely cope with the number of guests checking in and checking out. Its bell service is also very lousy. We had to call bell service four times and wait for almost 30 minutes before a bellman finally made it to our rooms to help us with our luggages. The duty manager is totally accessible and only reachable by an answering machine. Smiling is not innate in its hotel staff. There are only three redeeming factors in this hotel: 1. Its accessibility to Ala Moana Shopping Center; 2. The breathtaking view of the sea (if you are fortunate enough to score a room with a sea view), and 3. Justine Baisec, the sole helpful, patient, and accommodating front desk officer who was kind and patient enough to help us when we checked in. We did not blame him for giving us rooms that had not been cleaned yet. After all, how does one expect a front desk person to know that the room tagged to be unoccupied is still not made up? I will never go back to this hotel. I will not recommend this to any of my friends.","Manila, Philippines","aaavellano</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",10,2.0

A guest used their card to press the 8th floor. Once we got to our room 833 again issues with the electronic keys. Finally got one to work after 10 minutes or trying when we are already tired from traveling. The room was very clean, with lots of amenities. We did not realize when checking in that we were next to a construction zone and became annoyed that we were awoken Monday thru Friday with construction noises staring at 7 am. No compensation for this inconvenience. I went to get ice and walked all around the 8th floor. Finally called the front desk who referred me to housekeeping. I said I did not want them to bring me ice just need to know where the ice machine was hiding. We were informed our ice machine for the 8th floor was on the 6th floor. So went to the 6th floor and located the ice machine then it was playing the elevator lotto to see how many times I would have to to try the electronic key to get back to my floor.The electronic keys became an issue almost every morning when we used the gym. The gym facility itself was great. The door access was a different story. Usually someone already inside would see others struggling at the door and would stop their workout to open the doors or would wait for another guest who may have a magic key open the gym door.We enjoyed the restaurant just outside the front door on several occasions. Food, and service were very good.On Wednesday we came back to the hotel around 4 pm and learned by trial and error that we were completed locked out of the elevator and our room. I had to wait in the check-in line for 40 minutes to find out we had been checked out because they never connected our extended stay with our original check-in. Not pleasant.We used your concierge a few times. They were good to check us into a show in a nearby hotel and  for lining up a vehicle rental. They seemed to be less than helpful in finding us information about the local bus lines and schedules. Not sure why.

Parking and access to main roads is better as Waikiki is a series of one way streets to get in and out of. That being said the Ala Moana Hotel has seen its better days. The hotel is definitely getting worn down and in need of a major overhaul. It seems popular with many Airline flight teams and business people as it is right across the street from Convention center. Pluses are Starbucks in Lobby and location next to Mall and off Waikiki Restaurants which tend to be cheaper. Adequate free Wi-Fi in rooms.

It has a couple souvenir shops, convenient store, massage/spa, a couple restaurants, a Starbucks, and many more!

Behind the hotel there is a canal/river that leads to the ocean for a nice evening or afternoon walk. Restaurants, Walgreens, & Walmart nearby (less than a mile walk). About half-hour walk to the Waikiki beach area. We didn't mind walking there. It didn't seem like a long walk because we enjoyed every corner of the path which was a straight shot from the hotel. Hotel is clean. Bed was comfortable. Pillows were soft. Very clean and well-maintained hotel. We were happy with the room we got in Kona Tower. We had a view of the ocean which was nice. I have to mention that they have a concierge desk that can help you plan your days in paradise. Monica helped us make our trip memorable so that was a plus. We were happy with this hotel's location as we are not huge beach people anyway and we had no complaints about anything in this hotel. If your main reason of going to Hawai'i is to be on the beach almost every day and all day, I say stay away from this area and pay the extra $$$ to be on the Waikiki beach area.

Let me start off with the positive by saying the room service of cleaning the rooms daily was outstanding. Also ordering of food was pretty easy. Initially when I arrived I had to wait in line 25 minutes which isn't too bad due to many flights arriving. The issue I had was the elevators would rarely read room key cards and would cause you to skip past your floor often which wasted my time. My room had a large amount of mold on the ceiling with pant coming off the ceiling in the room. Sleep was interrupted by the sounds of construction on adjacent buildings. Parking was a nightmare it can take 20 mins to find a spot in the garage and you paid to park. The parking attendants were always friendly. Lastly what set me over the top. On the day of my last stay the fact that there was feces on the carpet in the lobby and entering / exiting the elevator which some mad it on my luggage. This was terrible.

Everyone was so nice and helpful. I had a great view of the ocean. One or two things that could be improved: no vent in the bathroom caused the smoke alarm to go off when I took a hot shower. Also, there is not a good chair for the desk - there is only a stool and it was too low for me to use to type on the laptop. The hotel did provide a chair for me upon request, but it did not have wheels and was also too low, so I was not very comfortable doing work. Also the Expedia guy at the tour desk talked me into doing a luau at Paradise Cove, and it was horrible. On top of that, their bus did not come to pick me up so I had to get a Lyft driver to take me, for an extra $70. Avoid the Plantation restaurant - breakfast buffet is no better than what you'd get for free at most hotels, and they charge you a lot for it. However, the fruit was really fresh and good.

For some reason they sell more parking passes than they can accommodate. So they require you to use valet parking and they double park cars downstairs - it guess it increases revenue for the hotel and valets. When we attempted to get our car at 945am, the line was perhaps 30 deep. I estimated that for almost every car, they had to run downstairs, locate your car, identify the car in front of yours, run back upstairs for the key, then move the obstructing car out of the way, move you car, park the obstructing car, then drive your car upstairs, at least ten minutes per car. Luckily, we were just planning an outing so we gave up and walked to an alternate attraction. Later when we returned at 100om, I asked the valet how long it took to clear out the mess - he said over two hours. I told him a lot of persons must have been yelling about missing flights.

We got our room keys and headed up to the room. Later that evening I logged onto my credit card website to check charges as I regularly do when on vacation. I came to find out the was a charge on my credit card for the for $167 (correct charge for the room) and another charge for $1,201. I immediately went down to the front desk I believe around (11:00 pm) to speak with the night agent. He told me, ""right now in the system it only shows the correct room charge. ($167)."" He would wait until the 3am reports to come out and will leave a message on my room phone if anything comes up.The next morning the gentleman left a message saying, ""that the charge of $1,201 was charge to my credit card, but immediately reversed.I came to figure out that our check in agent must have inputed 1201 into the ""charge box"" because our room number was 1201.I appreciate that he caught it right away. I also appreciate the night agent for running the report and getting back to me.I only thing I was disappointed about was that, because credit card refunds take 1-2 business days and it was the weekend, my credit card account would not be credited back until roughly Wednesday July 19 2017. It was a substantial amount of money so purchases for that weekend had to be put on hold.My credit card was credited back the $1201 and everything is back to normal.Luckily we are coming back to stay at the hotel on Thursday July 27th- Sunday July 30th.

Download the app as you can see where the bikes are, and if there is also space to drop them off at your destination. (We booked two per credit card). It was cheaper then a taxi and get to experience the sites more. We used Biki to get to Waikiki beach and back. You could walk it. But we wanted to save our energy for surfing...To and from the airport we booked with ""Speedi shuttle"". Clean, professional, and we also used them both ways. $15 per person, and they take credit.

I didn't realize that every room had been sold off iindividually, and presently, only some of the rooms are managed by the Ala Moana, owned presently by Mantra. The rooms are called condominiums, but they are just hotel rooms. If you book through the hotel, you will receive actual hotel housekeeping, at no extra charge (unfortunately, as one reviewer wrote, many housekeepers are getting carried away with ""tipping""). I booked a room managed by LSI Management. Everything negative is a reflection on this management company, not the hotel. With LSI management company, you have to pay extra for everything: $15 for addtional sets of towels$22 for replacement of towels, bathroom clean, make bed, remove trash$35 for full clean, replacement of towels, bathroom clean, change sheets, vacuum, dust, trash removal.Fine if your staying 1 night, we stayed 4 nights. We paid for the ocean view corner room, (the rooms ending in 08), which we have stayed in before. These are nice rooms, a bit dated, but comfortable, and the view is nice. Our room for this stay was 1908. The room was clean, but, 2 of the 5 lights in the bathroom were out, making it very dim, 1 of the lights by the bed was completely broken, so no reading on that side, no hairdryer, a partial roll of toilet paper, no trash pick up, and no cleaning supplies. Not to mention no clean towels or sheets, unless we wanted to pay extra.I like the location of this hotel. There is a walkway on the second floor that takes you to the mall right next door. In addition to obvious shopping, it has a grocery and lots of food places. I like to run in the mornings, and the park is just across the street. A nice track goes along the ocean, and is a very nice run. The convention center is a block away. I will stay at this hotel again, but, next time, I will make sure I book a room managed by the hotel.",San Antonio,"frodo4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio</strong>",65,4.0

It's only a couple blocks from the Hawaii Convention Center, is adjacent to the Ala Moana mall (you can walk to the Macys across their back parking garage off of the 2nd floor), and is equally close to Ala Moana park and its beaches and running trails. It's a long-ish walk into Waikiki, but it's doable, so one can stay there and do the traditional Honolulu tourist stuff, especially if you're not averse to the local buses. The ""Kona Tower"" rooms are on the small side, but are more than sufficient for a business visitor's needs. From the business perspective, the internet access was irritating - it was parsed by room, but my room never officially worked, so I ended up ""sponging"" off of signals from several adjacent rooms. They have a Starbucks on site that serves beer, and an in-hotel ABC -store equivalent that carries fresh fruit and coffee for making, so one doesn't have to do the $20+ breakfast buffet their hotel restaurant serves (and I didn't, not even one morning). The staff are very professional and helpful on all matters, and they know the town well - they put me onto several very nice restaurants in the immediate vicinity. It's clearly popular with Japanese tour companies (you'll encounter crowds in the mornings in their back lobby, waiting to board tour buses), but they're never so mobbed that service is a problem.

The shower smelled of mildew (no ventilation fan) and I had to keep the door closed because of the smell and my asthma. The toilet paper holder placement was very uncomfortable. The shower soap wrap was so difficult to open that even my teeth couldn't tear it open. The ottoman for the ""desk"" was so low I had to put two pillows on it and place my laptop in the drawer to type fairly comfortably. The sconces were crooked and when I tried to straighten them one of them flipped over and looked like it wanted to fall off the wall. The pillows were in sad shape: small, old, and only two to a bed. (Other hotels have bigger, better, and more pillows.) The bed was so uncomfortable--I could feel the springs in it. The safe showed a ""battery low"" message so I had to hang a PRIVACY tag on my door to keep people out of the room and keep my things safe while I was at the shopping center.

The staff is absolutely amazing as well! From the parking valets, to the various shops, boutiques, well stocked store, to the housekeeping, and environmental staff..just Awesome! Parking is the best value in the area I believe. Valet parking is $25 per night, (excluding gratuity), and $20 a day self-park, with in and out privileges.  There is ample parking, well lighted, with roving Security Officers in the underground parking.  There is an elevator, that takes you to the lobby, and on to your secure elevators, as they require a room key to utilize them. There are security cameras in them, and throughout the building for your safety.  Check-in, and check-out was a breeze! We bought the room in a package with air, so we drew #1240. The room is small, as rooms go, but we don't spend much time in it.  It was immaculate upon entry! Fresh!, Well appointed for the price! Fridge, coffee maker, safe, (pls. Purchase your own coffee in the store), the free coffee was hideous. Bathroom was fresh! , and well supplied with towels, and products.  TV had cable, and great channels, and was 42""! The bed is Queen sized, and very uncomfortable! If you are a larger person, 2 queen beds are a definite must!  There is no balcony, but a railing, that a child can get around! DO NOT RENT THIS ROOM WITH CHILDREN!!! The view was another condo building, and a construction site, but this is what we paid for. The construction was not very noisy, but it's there.. just a head's up! The Steakhouse is Amazing! As is the Royal Garden Restaurant! Many of the locals were dining here! Fair WARNING! about The Plantation Cafe. The food on the buffet was cold, tasteless, old, and a very pour value. I should have known..the place was empty! The staff...Excellent! But you can't eat them..so please don't ruin your day dining here!  There is no room service! Plenty of places to eat nearby! The Ala Moana Mall is connected to the hotel, at the 2nd fl, and a short, walk away, to World Class shopping, fast food, and upscale dining!  The pool area is very nice, with only 2 tables for snacks, and beverages. Overall, the hotel was an Excellent value!  Centrally located, minutes away from everything! Quite, Very clean, safe, and family friendly!  We will stay here, again, and again, but with a better room, and not in the Kona Tower.

It makes almost no difference in time to walk from one of the elevator banks to the other when you consider how many people there are using the Waikiki elevator bank. I almost always had a whole ""Kona"" elevator (there are three) to myself but never had a ""Waikiki"" elevator to myself. You need to insert your room's card key to go up in any elevator, and mine worked 100% of the time in the ""Kona"" elevators, while I (and others) experienced read errors almost a third of the time in the ""Waikiki"" elevators. You can still access the second floor bridge to the shopping center from the ""Kona"" elevators, and if you are carrying groceries back from Don Quijote (a nearby supermarket), the Kona side elevator bank is actually closer to the hotel's side entrance.",United States,"Huckleberry_Finn_808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",101,3.0

That was not my experience at this hotel when I arrived at 9:30 pm in the evening.. When I was handed the keys and got to my room, I found a mess, like the previous guest just walked out of the room. Of course, I went back to the front desk to get a new room, but was told sorry, ""It's not our room."" What? Not your room? Whose is it? On checking, the clerk told me that my room was owned by Gaia and it was their responsibility to fix. She explained that this was a condo hotel and different rooms were owned by different landlords. She gave me a number where I could contact the Gaia people. The idea of checking into a hotel where the front desk is not responsible for your room was new to me. After some fuss on my part, the lady at the desk, who worked for ""Ala Moana by Mantra"" agreed to call the Gaia office, to see if I could be given another, perhaps clean, room. It seems that ""Ala Moana by Gaia"" could neither provide another room or clean the one I was originally assigned. After more than an hour of back and forth, ""Ala Moana by Gaia"" agreed to pay for one of the rooms owned by ""Ala Moana by Mantra"" for one night. The following day I would be moved to a room owned by ""Ala Moana by Gaia"". So eventually a got a bed for the night after considerable aggravation. It is disconcerting not to be able to rely on the front desk when you are staying at a hotel and are instead being serviced by a third party, who is not even in the hotel. In none of the advertising I saw for Ala Moana was this confusing arrangement made clear. My advice to anyone contemplating the use of this hotel to make sure who they are renting from. It seems that ""Ala Moana by Mantra"" runs the front desk and owns many of the rooms, while ""Ala Moana by Gaia"" is one of several landlords who own and rent rooms in the building. At no time during my stay was my room made up nor did I receive fresh towels.

All the staffs at the reception and the concierge were very helpful. However, as we booked our room from a 3rd-party site, we didn't know it's actually serviced by another company called Airpads. The service from Airpads is horrible. The charge $30 for every time they clean up the room. So to save some money, I only requested to have the towel changed, which is free. However, I ordered the towel at 3pm, they only came at 8pm. And they do not collect back the soiled towels. The guy told us, the hotel will clear after we check out, which is 1 week later. Imagine the smell of the wet, soiled towels in the room for 1 week??? The following day, the toilet bowl in the room was choked, and water were leaking from the toilet bowl. We tried to call the hotel to fix it but again because its own by Airpads, they can't help us. We have tried calling Airpads, but nobody pick up the line!! We didn't dare to use the the toilet at all. No more booking from Airpads! Bad experience.

For that reason I didn't think it was necessary to book a room with any special view and I assumed that a mountain view room would be more than sufficient for a work trip. When I checked in I was informed that a new tower was under construction, but not to worry ""it will only be during the day"". So as long as am not in my room during daylight hours, it's fine right!?! Yeah right, no problem :( I go look at my room in the Kona (inferior) tower...it's on the 6th floor and my ""mountain view"" is a direct view of the construction site (see photos and then imagine the associated noise). It would be one thing if they had informed me at booking, but it was just an awful surprise when I arrived. In addition, the room was very small with only enough room for a queen bed. I then asked for a different room, even offering to wait until later in the afternoon if there was not other availability at that moment. I was told there were no other rooms and my only option for a better room was to ""upgrade"" to the Waikiki tower if I wanted to pay the additional price, although that room too would be a ""mountain""/construction view (see first photo below). I ultimately ""upgraded"" because the Waikiki tower room was several floors higher and larger and so I hoped it would have slightly less construction noise, but really the rooms here are not worth the price, especially if your balcony overlooks a construction pit. And take a look at my photos: the construction site is a dirt square with nary a pilon or rebar to be found....this project is JUST beginning. Also, keep in mind that this is hotel/condo building and it feels much more like a condo then a hotel. It's a very DIY type of experience.Pros: microwave and good-sized fridge even in the tiny Kona tower roomCons: lacks consistent hotel-type service, no one ever offered to help me with my bags, including when I changed rooms.I would only recommend considering this hotel if you get a REALLY exceptional deal and don't care about your room at all.

We rented a condo here which is basically one of their 225 sq ft rooms. This hotel does not have much 'going for it' other than the fact that its connected to the shopping mall. We have come and gone a minimum of 3 times per day and have been greeted once only! Their decorations are definately lacking and they have nothing festive for their guests. The don't seem to care at all! It's not the cleanest place...hallways are barely cleaned and always have garbage over flowing. There was a shooting here as well while we have been here (mall on Christmas day when it was closed) then also heard more shootings. Their fee's are an additional $25 per night for internet and of course pool use and fitness centre up from $15. If I could get a refund on our last 2 weeks here, I would most definately go elsewhere to stay. Although they say it has been updated, its dated, meaning not modern or contemporary. Very noisy and loud! Now that there is a brand new hotel being build right outside our window, we are woken up every morning at 7:30....wish we had known!!! This hotel thrives on airline pilots and attendants...they seem to like to cater to them rather than guests that are staying long term. They seem to ignore us and leave it up to the condo owners.

We booked through booking.com and when we arrived at the hotel, they told us that our room is managed by a third party company and not under the hotel.

There were 3 of us (1 girl and 2 guys) and we booked a King bed with a sofa. The hotel gave us 2 double beds. When we requested to change, they told us hey can't do that as we are managed by the third party. We called the third party and it was difficult to reach them as they didn't pick up the call. With no alternative solution, we had to make do with this uncomfortable decision. That was not all. The room only had toiletries and amenities for 2 people. There were 3 of us. The hotel staff refused to provide us with an additional towel because we are managed by the third party. Nobody topped up our toiletries the next day and when we were short of toilet roll, we called reception, house keeping and they all directed us around and around. Even the customer service manager gave us a call back and she wasn't very polite because they said they get such complaints all the time and we are managed by the third party. So she said she cannot spare us anything, not even an additional roll of toilet paper and she suggested us to go and buy from the store across the road. Amazing customer serivice over here. She mentioned that she would call the third party for us also. Well, that is 2 days gone already.

It is attached to the mall via a parking lot, so very easy and convenient to walk to. We stayed here with an infant thinking it would be convenient if we were at the mall and needed to split up and someone head back to the hotel room early. We also weren't planning on staying IN Waikiki. We used to stay at another local favorite, The Pagoda Hotel, but the last 4 or 5 times we stayed there, I promised myself we wouldn't again.The Ala Moana Hotel costs a little more, but it is worth it. Rooms are average of what you find in Honolulu- little bit aged at times, but nothing really to complain about. One thing I thought was weird, was I booked two rooms at the same time online, for the same price. I checked in earlier, then after picking up family from the airport a few hours later, checked into the second room.When checking in the first time I got to the counter at the same time as another couple next to us. The desk agent said to the other guy ""great news, we have upgraded you to the newer tower at no charge"". I thought that was pretty great, but am not the type to say ""hey, that guy got an upgrade, can I have one too?""After that, I thought nothing of it. However, when checking in to my second room I booked, the desk agent said the same thing to my mother who was using the room. I thought it was kind of strange a few hours later, they gave her an upgraded room as well.Anyhow, just a weird observation, I still enjoyed my stay, and will stay here again.The Starbucks in the lobby was convenient, and pretty cool- they serve beer and wine in the evenings. Also, there is a Chinese restaurant in the hotel that is very good. This is our go to spot for dim sum. Delicious and clean. No need to drive to Chinatown for good dim sum.Parking is a little strange here. Because of so many one way streets, it's a little humbug having to drive around the block to access the parking lot. That is minor though, not a big deal. Would definitely LOVE to see the Ala Moana Hotel give a kama'aina rate on parking rates though, as many other hotels to.

So I used other search engines (Orbitz, Hotels.com etc.) to find a hotel that could accommodate my extra day. Low and behold I found rooms available at the same hotel (Ala Moana) that I just inquired with. So at this point I am a little perplexed trying to understand and navigate this dilemma. So I call Ala Moana directly to find answers and they have no rooms available but on third-party sites they are available. Of course the reservation folks had no answers or clues on why I am experiencing this and that I should book via the third-party website if it’s available because their hands are tied. So I ended up booking this single reservation. So speed things up, I am all checked-in and trying to make the most of this trip and reservation. So few days after checking-in, I thought it would be a great idea to ask the front-desk staff about my experience and explorer the possibilities of being able to stay in the same room, instead of grabbing my things and relocating to another room within the same hotel. While let’s just say wishful thinking and what a terd sandwich to say the least. By the end of the day I ended up talking to several front desk staff and then the lovely night-shift manager whole couldn't tell his rear hole from a hole in the ground to say the least. I was trying to have him explain their booking process, online reservation system, and their involvement with third-party reservation sites. All I got from him was lip service and 14 years in industry and blah blah blah. I ended up leaving (walking away) by his 4th explanation of my reservation experience and told him to shove it and his 14 years.So let’s just say the check-out and check-in process is insane and you better pray that your room is ready, computers are online, or flight crew. Also, you might as well leave your reasons and explanations at the airport because these folks could careless on how bad you need your room. Don't ask for a stupervisor, because they'll really tell you to go pound Hawaiian sand and come back and just maybeee your room might be ready. I'm telling you! So I had to wait in-line for 30min to check-out of my first room and then to be told that the computers are off-line at the moment and to come back in an hour so that I can check into my second room. At this point I am ready to walk the plank in the shark infested waters so I don't have to interact with this hotel. Mysteriously they were able to check me out but not re-check me in???But wait, if I recall correctly they have one or two customer service or appreciate certs in the lobby from early or mid-2000s to show you their greatness once upon a time.You've been warn stay clear from this hotel. Then again you don't miss what you don't know (or experience).","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Nachobusiness81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",1,1.0

The hotel has been updated somewhat from its old look in the 1980s and 1990s, I think around when the convention center was opened a number of years ago. It is in a very convenient location - there is much shopping in that area, not just the Ala Moana mall, but a big Wal-Mart, a Target that will open in 2017, a very big and well-stocked Walgreen, the big and interesting Don Quixote supermarket and mini-mall, and the Ward Village, Ward Warehouse, Ward Center area of small malls (along with two Ross stores in that area). The transportation for the hotel is very good - many of Oahu's buses stop at Ala Moana, there are many shuttle and trolley buses, and the new train will have a station there later when it opens in a few years. The hotel itself needs a lot of updating. The room floor files are old, the beds are the older, short types (as opposed to the excellent, high and soft Marriott hotel-chain beds), the furnishings are ok but also dated. There are some condo-rooms also there for rent, but as far as I could see, they were pretty old looking also. Perhaps there are some exceptions, but check your rooms carefully. The price is not bad, though the hotel is very busy with airline people checking in and out at all hours.

My most recent stay has changed my opinion about the Ala Moana Hotel. The room I was given this time was very tiny--with even tinier bathroom--when compared to all of my previous stays. But the real issue wasn't the room size - it was the bathroom. I almost gagged when I opened the shower curtain which gave off a strong moldy smell. The bath tub drained very slowly so there was always a lake before I could even get the water temperature right. The faucet was so tight that I needed both hands to turn it... and I could keep turning it to the right with the water going either super hot or cold with each turn... The bath tub caulking showed moldy spots... The hair dryer worked for two minutes and died... The handle on the bathroom door was not put on quite right (the handle didn't fully cover the hole on the door)...I don't know if I was given such a low-grade room because I booked it through TripAdvisor (via getaroom). The price was only slightly better than the local resident rate. On the plus side, the room I got came with a full-size bed and a single-size pull-out sofa bed.

It more of a condo rental then a hotel. You checked in at the Ala Moana Hotel's front desk and you can used their lobby, pool and elevators but you get no room service. So what you get is what the condo owner give you. In my case, it got a nice room. It came with a microwave and refrigerator. A/C works perfectly. Cabinets got dishes, cups, and forks/knives. The place was very clean and I kept it that way. It even had a vacuum cleaner (small one) just in case. Bathroom came with three wash clothes, four towels but no hand towels or foot mat when getting out of shower. Bed was comfortable but it only came with two lame pillows and bit of a ragged blanket and sheet. Great view of the Punchbowl and what the top of Ala Moana Center looks like. The real downside were, it came with only ONE roll of toilet paper (had to steal some more from my parents). Funny that Trip Advisor don't have this ""Gaia Resort"" listed. I thought the cost was bit too much and funny thing is, they charged me for the entire stay even before I got on the plane. Watch out for that just in case. Location of Ala Moana Hotel proves to be ideal. Close to the Ala Moana Beach, shopping center and several other places. Easy bus ride to Waikiki and activities there. I could live without room service but I hope whoever own this place to provide a better blanket and more toilet paper rolls. I left two extra behind just to be friendly. Oh yeah....the hotel appears to be plague with false fire alarms. Quite irritating when it tell you to move to the lobby via fire escape and you are on the 35th Floor. Luckily, couple of minutes later, you get a recall announcement!!Another downer just to be fair is that the internet service is super spotty. I am not sure if it the hotel itself that is lame or the condo owner. But it was lame!! The cable TV was also pretty lame as the channels were rather limited but they do have HDTV and some of the sports channels were in HD. That is good, limited but good. And do wish they will provide a real office chair for your desk, instead of some sort of a sitting stool!But overall, it wasn't a bad stay, it wasn't a great one either but something I can live with.

It is adjacent to the Ala Moana Center, which literally has almost EVERYTHING, it is walking distance from the Ala Moana Beach Park, it is close to the Kea'aumoku Walmart and Walgreens, and if you want to go to famous Waikīkī, you can catch the Waikīkī Trolley at the Ala Moana Center for just $2. Other than the great location, the hotel itself has a very upscale yet kama'āina friendly atmosphere, well furnished, modern and comfortable guest rooms with FREE WIFI, spacious and relaxing pool deck, full-service fitness center, Starbucks in the lobby, courteous and friendly staff, skybridge to the Ala Moana Center, and like I mentioned earlier, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The hotel also offers a $14 airport shuttle service that you can utilize (taxi is too expensive; city bus too crowded). The hotel also has good dining options on-site and the Ala Moana Center has a very large and well-appointed food court.

Managers need to enforce a ""no texting"" rule during working hours for the valets, however.The wonderful Plantation Café buffet is only open for breakfast and serves fresh fruit, juices, pastries, eggs, waffles, breakfast meats, chef's specials, great coffee and is fairly priced considering the choices. Kathy, one of the servers, is wonderful! The hotel now has a well visited in-house Starbuck's franchise. The handy hotel store has just about everything: food, refreshments, clothes, souvenirs, toiletries, etc. but it is a little pricey.We did not use the pool this time, so I do not know if the chlorine levels have been adjusted. The $20 per day parking fee is annoying, but I imagine all the hotels levy it.

The hotel is expensive but that seems to be the case in most hotels in this town. The room was average size, clean, comfortable. The wifi worked well. The hotel location right next to the shopping mall made it useful. A downside, no breakfast included in the rate, cheap. The main issued I noticed with a colleague is that the hotel made a hold on his credit card upon arrival as a security for other expenses under the promise that at the check out this charge would be removed. Well, that was a month ago and the hold is still in the credit card and the hotel just gives excuses and does not remove it.

Given that Starbucks is right in the lobby it would have been good business to team up and offer the clients checking in a small sampling of coffee or cold beverage.Once in the room, I was disappointed. We were on the 13th floor. It was so loud from street traffic, sirens and overall 'downtown' noise. We had 2 double beds. My hubby is 6.5. I'm much shorter and even my feet hung off the end of the bed. The room was clean. We asked for a new room and we were accommodated the next day. The 25th floor was much quieter. The staff were all friendly. The rooms were cleaned upon request each day and fresh towels were always stocked. The gym was well equipped but small and no view at all. A closed in court yard. The pool could have been so much prettier. More foliage or décor. It was quite sterile and closed very early. No evening swims after a long day.We could see the sun sets - which were incredible - from the stairway balcony. They were only marred by the giant construction cranes. Downtown Oahu is very different from the rest of the Island. Do yourself a favour and do the Circle island tour. 8 Hour day but so worth it. Different world from downtown.

Itʻs worth upgrading to the Waikiki Towers where most of the rooms are newly renovated. This Hotel does get a bit busy too because most tour companies book their rooms here, especially from Japan.

I was given a room in the Kona building. I read a number of disappointed reviews about this particular building, but it was the perfect place for me. After a long day of interacting with people, I just wanted to be alone to vegetate. My room, and everything I saw on the way to my room, appeared to be freshly updated. No musty smell which can be so common in older hotels. The room, not huge, was nicely appointed. I loved that my room had a mini fridge and a microwave. No lanai, but I had an amazing view of the Ala Moana beach park and the two yacht clubs. The hotel is centrally situated which made travel to various parts of the area a breeze. The fact that it's a ""sky bridge"" away from the Ala Moana shopping center might make a shopper's heart skip a beat. I did not avail myself of the on-property restaurants but did buy a number of food items at the hotel's sundry store. The only downside, to my way of thinking, was the parking situation. The hotel offered both self and valet parking. Unfortunately, the hotel was packed the weekend during my stay. Valet parking was sold out. Self parking, when returning after 5pm, was a nightmare. Being very familiar with the high cost of hotel rooms in the Honolulu/Waikiki areas, this hotel offered a lovely room at a very fair price.","Captain Cook, Hawaii, United States","Nancy Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Captain Cook, Hawaii, United States</strong>",51,4.0

The people at the bell desk were terribly unhelpful and lazy. Lastly, they treat the military people staying here terribly. They design policies to rip them off and price gouge them at every turn.

But to get to the main drag you need the bus.Take the pink shuttle its more reliable than the bus and its the same price and it runs way more often. You can buy the ticket on board. Its double decker and open roof so a real fun and pleasurable way to get around.Fantastic little fridge and microwave they both worked like a dream and seemed quite new.Magnificent and deep bath spoil yourself have a bath. I am 6ft 4inch and it accommodated me quite easily.C O N ' SPillows were horrible lumpy and could not sleep had to go kmart and buy a $5 pillow which was a dream. Why cant the hotel source nice pillows ????Shower water flow was pathetic very hard to get wet. But out of the tap it flooded out like a torrent.Room I had was very very small, ok for 1 person impossible for more.Very loud slamming doors on rooms became very annoying when you are trying to sleep. Sound proofing btw room not good could hear ppl sneezing and coughing.No cordless phone which was crazy having to sit at desk to talk.Heavy construction taking place next door started at 7am and was disturbing.Some staff on the front desk could be a bit friendlier I guess bc the hotel has 1100 rooms it loses some of its warmth.This hotel is used for flight attendants and they were every where every day and they are loud and obnoxious. In the lobby at the pool. Luckily it was in very small doses.You will most likely never get an early check in so if you arrive at 7am like me expect to wait 7 hours for your room.

The pool was nice, but closed at sundown, which was 7 o'clock. Most hotels I've been to leave their pool open and turn on some lights so people can swim later at night. I was there for a work conference and didn't get back to the hotel until 9 every evening. That made the pool useless for me.There are two towers to the hotel. My tower didn't connect to the third floor with the pool/workout room. So I had to go down to the lobby on one set of elevators and up on another set. Kinda inconvenient. You also need to insert your room key to make the elevator work. It's a security thing, which was nice, but it was a little bit of a hassle to get everyone on the elevator to insert their key and press their floor.They have a Business Center, but you have to pay to use it.

Located right next to our Famous Ala Moana Shopping Center, this is very convenient to shopping and close to Ala Moana Beach Park. There's a Starbucks right in the lobby which is a great place to relax and start off the day. Pro's:-Self Parking is available at 20$/day for guests-Valet Parking also available-Fine Dining Restaurant with Fabulous views located in the Hotel, (prime signature steak and seafood)-Cafe also located on property-Walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center-Walking distance to Ala Moana Beach Park-Located at the entrance to Waikiki-Recently renovated rooms that are comfortable and have amenities of refrigerator, safe, microwave, complimentary coffee in room.There are 2 towers in the hotel. -Hotel is also good to host meetings and banquets, and parties-Nightclub in the lobby (Rumours) that hosts private parties and is usually pretty busy on Friday/Saturday nights. CONs: -For visitors that want the experience of shopping/walking in waikiki, the walk to Waikiki is about 10 minutes from the hotel, or drive or UBER there.-At various times during the day the check in process might be slow if there's a lot of tour groups or airline personnel checking in. -This is NOT a 5 Star hotel but I think its a good value and pretty solid accommodations.

Easy to duck out of boring sessions for a quick spot of shopping in the huge Ala Moana Centre on the other side of this hotel! The lovely Ala Moana park and shorefront is also very close - a much more local-flavoured beach, great for people-watching, not very touristy. Waikiki Beach per se is just a 15 minute bus ride away (walk across the road to Ala Moana Blvd, catch Bus #19, 20, 42, there's a bus every 10 minutes, only $2.50 each way). This makes for a perfect base to combine business and leisure (great for partners and companions of folks attending conferences in the convention centre).The hotel itself is fairly standard for business hotels in the western world - good, strong free wifi, enough space to unpack, a big comfy bed, decent bathroom with lots of towels and basic toiletries (bring your own, it's the usual all-in-one conditioning shampoo again, yuk!), a microwave, bar fridge and filter coffee maker - but no kettle to boil water for a cup of tea (friends of ours went to walmart and bought their own!), no cutlery to stir your coffee or tea with and be warned, the cups are not really microwave-proof. The staff are all friendly and efficient (especially the cleaning staff, nothing is too hard for them, always smiling and accommodating). What impressed me most with this hotel though was its gym facilities, wow, this beats all other hotels I have ever been to. Excellent, well-maintained good quality equipment, weights, and enough treadmills, x-country trainers, stationary bikes etc, you never have to wait for your turn. Lots of room to do your own stuff too, including a separate space for floor exercises, complete with mats and fitballs. It's open from 5:00am to midnight too so one can fit in a workout anytime. We had a breakfast in the Plantation Cafe several times, at $16.50 per person, it is OK if you have a big appetite and can justifiably consume all the available food, but if you only need coffee and pastry, yoghurt and a bit of fruit to start your day, it is better value to just get some from nearby walmart or don quijote and keep these in your room fridge. The Signature Restaurant upstairs though is great for happy hour treats, really good value drinks and tapas and an excellent bartender to boot. Overall, I would stay in this hotel again, if I need to attend something in the Convention Centre (and someone else is paying for it!) or for an overnight stopover, longer stays will need a rethink.","Queensland, Australia","geckopoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queensland, Australia</strong>",213,4.0

This isn't a family oriented hotel, but we made it work and the staff was incredibly helpful! I will say that the hotel rooms, no matter which you reserve, are incredibly small so if you have a lot of stuff or more than 2 people, be prepared to squeeze.

There are a lot of shops and food options near the hotel (both in the massive Ala Moana Centre as well as outside). The lobby has a Starbucks outlet. The Ala Moana Hotel does not charge a resort fee (as many or most of the Waikiki Properties do) and charges only 20 USD/day for self-parking (which is less than many others charge).

Turns out we needed to speak to them the minute we got to the room, because they gave us 2 full beds when we were confirmed for a King - but couldn't speak to anyone as their office was closed, and we'd traveled all day so we just wanted to go to bed (which was thankfully really comfy) so we just dealt with it for the stay.The location is in close proximity to pretty much everything we wanted to do - shopping at the mall literally next door, the less popular (and therefore more enjoyable) beach was walking distance and many, many restaurants to choose from - including a Starbucks in the lobby with great service!As for the amenities, there was a decent-sized gym (that we didn't use) and the pool we only ended up going to once - it was really nice but construction downstairs was too loud and therefore prevented an enjoyable time trying to relax.Lastly, the parking was our only real complaint - be prepared to pay $20/day just to leave your car there overnight, yes you can go in and out unlimited throughout the day but I guess I figured you'd only have to pay if you used the valet, but I was wrong...Overall, the pictures on the site are pretty accurate and you should enjoy your stay as long as you're prepared!","Orlando, Florida","kerthom5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",13,4.0

There are nice shops in the lobby (including a Starbucks), the Ala Moana mall is next door and there's a fantastic, upscale restaurant on the 36th floor.

We could look out on the harbor and could see Macy's at the shopping mall next door. We could see our ship peeking through two tall buildings the day she arrived. We walked to the mall and had dinner the first evening. We found Long's Drugs to have all the extra supplies we needed for our cruise. Beside the outside of Macy's we spotted a trail to a lovely park beside the yacht harbor.We ate at the hotel's Plantation Cafe for breakfast. It was a nice buffet but pricey especially if you select from the hot menu and the continental menu. We grabbed some breakfast sandwiches and juice from the hotel gift shop for our second morning. We also grabbed sandwiches for a quick and inexpensive lunch before an afternoon at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The Cultural Center bus picked up and let us off on one side of the hotel making for easy transport around the island. We had plenty of room in our room and were very comfortable. The room was even made up and cleaned after we returned from our excursion.

The ""sky bridge"" to the Ala Moana centre is actually a ramp from the second floor leading to one of the centre car parks. We needed a crib for my daughter, but what was supplied was rather rickety and with a very thin mattress, such that she tossed and turned most nights and didn't get any proper sleep.

Only one to go, thank God! I booked using a conference discount (attending the convention center just down the road) and although all the other delegates I knew were placed in the Waikiki tower, I was put in the Kona Tower. Waikiki Tower guests have balconies. Kona Tower guests have a sliding glass door and a fence. Seriously. The room is cluttered with a sofa bed I didn't ask for and don't need, a small queen size bed that's hard and has this awful rebounding bounce when your partner climbs in or out of it. Or rolls over. Or moves in any way. The bath is about four feet long, is crammed up against the toilet, which is almost under the vanity where the sink is.I did ask to be moved but they said they would charge an additional amount per night, even when I pointed out comparable rates on Expedia, and that other delegates had been housed in the superior wing. But my travel agent had paid up front, so I suppose they don't have to accommodate moves when they already have the money.As for position, it is near the convention centre and the Ala Moana shopping centre. But this is not close to Waikiki Beach, is not a particularly nice area to walk around in (brothels, strip clubs) and I would recommend staying further away and traveling down to the convention centre and mall, rather than staying close by. So disappointing to not walk around in the balmy evenings enjoying the tropical moonlight. Instead, I open my sliding glass door, lean on the pool fence, and gaze out at the car parking ramp- over the way is the ocean, which is nice.

Built in seat in the roll in shower close enough to reach the waster controls and shower head. Power assist for that heavy hotel room door and a bed low enough to get in and out of without help. I really appreciate such good amenities for a wheelchair user, the only tough thing inside the hotel was that they have such great carpeting it's tough to roll on. Hard to complain too much about that! So nice to stay somewhere that doesn't entail my spouse having to help me get in and out of bed, on and off the toilet and in and out of the shower.

The rooms were recently refurbished with new carpeting, drapes, chairs and linens and look very clean and modern.

When we finally paid a fortune, we got a king bed with a beautiful view that included a ""partial"" view of the ocean. The maid was wonderful...and after dealing with security a couple times, they (he) were wonderful. Although I am not a fan of Starbucks, the baristas in the lobby Starbucks were so welcoming at 6 am each morning and the coffee was great.What was wrong? Let's start with the room. If you get a bargain price - it's no bargain. Queen bed maybe, but when the room is only slightly bigger than the bed and the only window overlooks a roof with cooling units, it's not a dream location for a week. After upgrading an Expedia reservation at a cost that would have gotten us in a Hyatt Regency room overlooking Waikiki, we had a king bed with a kitchenette. Terrific right? Not exactly. We picked up dinner and brought it back to the room only to discover that there were no kitchen utensils or silverware....or even a plate to eat off. A quick call to the front desk cleared that up - silverware and plates are an extra $25 to rent. Serious? If you're not too sympathetic because we ARE in Hawaii for the week, after all, it gets much worse. I won't bore you with the details except to say I have never been told ""no"" more times by hotel management. We spent cumulative hours going between the lobby and 26th floor only half dressed from the beach, trying to get a room key that worked. Each time, facing the same staff, but nonetheless having to wait for security to escort us to our room to confirm our identity. Do yourself a big favor and STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! Get yourself a king room at the Hyatt (or the like) where you're not cattle and really relax. Note that ALL the airlines are contracted with Ala Moana. Hang out in the lobby and you are guaranteed to see you flight crew. The airlines don't contract for the best experience. It's all about $$. And if you still think you're ready to take on the Ala Moana jungle, at least do yourself the favor of bringing a real pillow, because anything you get at Walmart for under $2 will be better than the house pillow - even a wadded up wet swimsuit.","Spokane, Washington","karey w</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spokane, Washington</strong>",8,2.0

We took a punt on the Ala Moana Hotel (a mountain view suite).Thankfully it was a VERY positive experience. Our flight from Australia arrived early (6.05 am) so we were at Ala Moana by 7.30. Instead of the usual 2.00 check in, they were helpful and we were in a few hours later. The suite clean, 2 huge door size windows in the lounge room -so nice to have big windows that OPEN.

The pool (level 3) clean, lots of space if you want privacy. One set of traffic lights and Ala Moana Beach Park is a 2-3 minute walk (also Magic Island).

The check-in check-out experiences were curt and it felt as though we were doing them a favour. When we checked in, we were given no advice about facilities or shops available in the hotel and we had to find those out for ourselves (like a shop that sells general food items, gifts, drinks and liquor). We were staggered for a hotel of this size that there was not a single thing in the mini bar (not even water), no room service, nor any on-site eatery for lunch or dinner (only for breakfast which was very good, friendly with generous buffet selections).When we eventually did spend a day at Waikiki Beach, we noted there were endless shopping areas right along the beach strip so there was no need to stay at Ala Moana to enjoy good shopping. We would never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to others unless you were looking for a cheap rate and could get it.","Cooroy, Australia","Glen M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cooroy, Australia</strong>",0,2.0

Somehow ended up with around 4 separate bookings for various periods so had to call (from the UK) at least twice to sort it out after a confused chain of emails. Eventually sorted but by that time only a slightly higher rate available, which wasn't a great start.Luckily once there the hotel was generally very good value for the great location. Close to the large Ala Moana shopping mall which has a food court and good restaurants, so you don't necessarily have to walk to Waikiki. If you do, it's about 20-25 minutes away on foot, but there are plenty of buses. Nice rooftop pool on the third floor above the Lobby but a little small for the size of the hotel and not enough shade or parasols. But proximity to a relatively quiet beach makes this less of a problem.We stayed in the Kona Tower, which has limited views compared to the main tower, so request a room there if possible. The room itself was large enough with a comfortable bed, plenty of wardrobe space, a good sized fridge and desk space.On at least two nights we had power cuts caused by flooding elsewhere on the island, which affected the downtown grid, but not the Waikiki grid. The longest was around 5-6 hours. The staff dealt with the situation well and did their best despite some very angry guests and obviously not being able to do much themselves.Breakfast was available but a little too expensive considering there was plenty of cheaper choices nearby and a Starbucks within the hotel. There is also a small shop selling a good range of snacks and drinks, with souvenirs, though obviously at a bit of a premium.Overall a very good hotel, particularly if you need to be near the Convention Center rather than in Waikiki itself.","Bristol, United Kingdom","deanwbrs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",22,4.0

The food was excellent and was very well presented with the Holiday Season motif. The one thing that always impresses me with a dinner buffet is how the cooked vegetable dish is prepared. Most times the cooked vegetables are overcooked and ""soggy."" The vegetable medley of squash, carrots, broccoli, and onions were perfectly cooked when served. Served hot but still maintained the fresh ""crunchy: texture. Service was excellent, Banquet service was always around to meet our requests.

I chose it primarily based on price and because it was near the Ala Moana shops. It met expectations on both of those counts. Pros:- it is close to the Ala Moana shops, you really could not stay any closer- there are a range of food outlets and ABC shops in easy walking distance- it is close to bus stops for getting around Waikiki- the room I had was fine - good shower, good bed, clean enough. It looked like it had been freshly painted Cons:- it is not close to the main part of Waikiki; it's a good 20-30 minute walk, or 10 minute cab ride- the neighbourhood around the area is not particularly nice. There are a few strip clubs and seedy looking dive bars around - despite its massive size, it doesn't offer room service - I didn't find it practical to walk to the beach; too far and too much hassle. The hotel obviously serves a lot of airlines, you could see a lot of them around the place. So it is serviceable, but economical. Staying here made me realise that next time I come to Hawaii, I'll stay near the main part of Waikiki. I'd rather be able to walk to the beach and then get a bus to the shops than vice versa.

I thought I could get along without a car, but I injured my achiles heel and even the block walk to the Convention Center was painful. I rented a car and found parking more convenient than I imagined, the parking fees are for 24 hours and you can go in an out with ease. The hotel has a deep, salt water pool which is not attractive to small kids, but makes a great place for the flight attendants who stay here to sunbathe. the hotel is in good shape, much of it newly remodeled. Very urban and upscale. The rooms are tiny and the balconies scary. The ceilings are low and my 6'5"" friend had to duck the smoke alarms and felt cramped.I do recommend the hotel for conventions or shopping. If you're here for the beach stay closer to the shore or further south. If you're here for vacation try to spend a couple days on less crowded parts of the island, or other islands. Ala Moana is not a romantic hotel, it's very business like. I booked through a third party and saved a lot but also didn't get the maid service or amenities other guests got.It's a short walk to nice restaraunts and the Honolulu Coffee Company so you don't have to drink the Starbucks over roasted french roast coffee in the lobby. The local shopping center is upscale, high retail, but six blocks away is a walmart. Waikiki is a small Asian city now, and there are good cultural opportunities, lots of sushi and Asian food places. Diners and Drive ins are suspect, we got rare hamburger at one of the recommended places, seems everyone relates to uncooked food, even beef.You can probably tell I'm not an urban type, the rustic countryside is more to my liking, but if you're here on business the Ala Moana is a convenient choice. My room was neat and clean and the fitness center was big. Most of the airlines put their flight crews here, so they're a good resources for tourist information.Note, it's a $34 cab ride to the airport, $12 on the shuttle but you often have to wait a long time, or $2.50 on the bus which is quite fast, but they don't allow suitcases or big duffels. Everyone tells you you can't take pineapple home in your suitcase because of agriculture requirements, but you can. But not papaya.

There are two sets of food selections that alternate each morning.Our only problem was in the room we reserved when we booked by phone. Because one of us has balance and mobility problems we could not use a standard room that has a shower head over the bath. Therefore we had to book a disability or ADA room. When booking, we were advised that there were no ADA rooms in the Kona Tower (the cheaper part of the hotel) and we had to book one in a dearer tower. This we did and it was confirmed by email. However when we arrived, we were advised there were no ADA rooms available apart from one in the Kona Tower. We accepted this but when we asked for the rate to be reduced back to the Kona Tower level we were told that reception staff could change almost anything except for the rate on their computers from the original booking.

I found it incredibly disappointing that they gave my friend a broken crib.Being in Hawaii, you would think the pool would be amazing.

I suggest you take the Kona Tower elevator since it is less crowded during peak hours and it is shorter walk from the side entrance. There is a pedestrian bridge connecting the hotel to Ala Moana Center Parking lot and you can walk into the Mall from there. Ala Moana Park is right across from the hotel and you can catch a bus to go to Waikiki Beach or to Iolani Palace. Bus fare is 2.50 exact change and very comfortable and air conditioned. The hotel also has a swimming pool but I did not use it. Free wifi is included with our package. Usually you have to pay extra.

Just opened: a new Starbucks that helps make the lobby a pleasant place to sit.Two key things to understand:1. This is a mid-price hotel, not a luxury hotel. It is roughly comparable to Holiday Inn, but with features that are sometimes higher end and sometimes more budget-like. For example, it has valet parking, but also a coin-op laundry. It has a nightclub but not a full service restaurant. It has breakfast with waiters that costs about $17, but it is only a buffet that is no better than the free breakfast at a chain motel. The bellboy will whistle for a taxi, but the front desk gives you a page of info on city buses.2. It is located close to a mall and the convention center. Anything else is a bit of walk, or a ride, to get there. For example, a 15 minute walk to Waikiki beach, Ala Moana beach, or breakfast places.If those two things (price point and location) are ok, then you will be happy. However, if you really want a luxury hotel on Waikiki at a budget price, it isn't so. I mention this because some reviewers who complain seem to expect it to be something it isn't.Guests are a mixture of vacationing Americans (mostly without children, but some with), convention-center goers with name tags, and airline crews from Asian countries. Also, the building is partly 2 BR condominiums and partly hotel -- I never noticed the condo owners, actually.Overall I was quite satisfied. Nothing was exceptional, but it was quite reasonable given the price and location. ","Iowa City, Iowa","700Papa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Iowa City, Iowa</strong>",101,4.0

Started around happy hour and left not long before closing. The food and drinks were great, though expensive; the happy hour pricing early on helped to temper the blow, but we left several hundred dollars at the place.We had one of the best waiters I've ever had... and I get around. There were 7 of us, plus a two year old, all somewhat scatter-brained, hungry, and thirsty. He handled it all with class, promptly, patiently, and politely.So, what's wrong with the place? It's the floor manager. The tall fellow who may greet you when you come in. Turns out, he is enough of a *** to make it worth my while to write this review to warn you about the place. Simply put, he is unpleasant, unprofessional, and as far as I can tell a racist of some sort.One of us, a great semi-professional jazz pianist, with permission from a waiter and once we were just about the only guests in the place sat down behind the piano and started playing some light jazz tunes. He is good! Waiters were appreciatively turning around to see who is playing (their two regular pianists are very pedestrian...). We just paid the bills and were about to go home. Then the manager fellow comes up to the piano, abruptly tells my friend to stop, and then gets in his face about guests not being allowed to play. Really??? A restaurant manager getting in the face of a guest with no reason or provocation whatsoever. And when I got up to diffuse the situation, the fellow threatens to call security and kick us out. Never happened to me before. Truly beyond unbelievable.The bottom line: Stay away from the place until they post in big bold letters that they have fired the guy! And for now, I'm disputing the restaurant charge on my CC as the incident has made the whole experience worth nothing at all.","Alexandria, Virginia","SlavaL_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",28,1.0

It is also located one block from the Hawaii Convention Center, so it's super easy for convention goers. The hotel itself is fine. It's nothing elaborate or fancy, but it's just fine. It sounds like they're in the process of doing some remodeling, and in fact, they're building a brand new Starbucks in the lobby. Our room was totally fine and normal. Nothing out of the ordinary or fancy. I liked the ceramic tile floor around the bathroom and entry way. The room had a fridge and a microwave, so that was pretty convenient. The AC worked very well and we kept it blasting the entire time. Our room had a nice balcony (the AC shuts off when you open the balcony door). We did not get service, so I can't comment on how the cleaning staff did other than to say that when we got to our room, it was clean. When we passed the staff in the hallways, they always greeted us and were friendly. There are a couple of restaurants at the hotel - one off the lobby (diner/casual?), one on the third floor by the pool (Chinese) and one up on the roof/higher floor (steakhouse). We did not go to any of these, unfortunately, as we had too many other plans, but it was nice to have options. They also have a few small shops off the lobby for souvenirs and snacks and stuff if you don't feel like venturing over to the mall. We went to the pool several times and were pleasantly surprised. My sister swore it was salt water, and after a while, I started to believe she was right, but I still smelled like chlorine when I got out, so I don't know. Can it be both? I don't know :) Anyway, the pool was never crowded and we were always able to get an umbrella or shaded area. The area was relatively quiet, mostly occupied by people reading books or sunbathing. There were a few smaller children but nothing majorly loud. There are lounge chairs and also some tables and chairs in the shade. There's a very nice staff member who provides you with two towels upon arrival at the pool. We took Uber to several places and it was always pretty cheap to get anywhere (no more than $15) so I'm sure we were within walking distance of a lot of places, but it was unusually hot and we were tired and hungry/thirsty, so we decided against walking.

Check-in was very easy and uneventful. Crews from most airlines stay here, so I enjoyed our many, brief discussions about aviation with them. Our room was on the 31st floor, and we had a nice view of the marina and ocean. Waikiki is about a 15-minute scenic walk, so if you are planning on using the great exercise room, why not walk down to the beach instead? The convenience store on the first floor has just about everything imaginable. Our room had been remodeled, and I had no complaints about its comfort, appearance, or cleanliness. However, most of the Filipino housekeeping staffs and waiters at the cafe were unfriendly and not at all helpful. They clearly and desperately need customer service and attitude adjustment training! On the other hand, Kathy, a Chinese lady in the Plantation Cafe, was the friendliest and most attentive server we have ever met. Her contagious smile and happy demeanor started our days off right. Every morning, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet and all of its fresh fruits. In another review, someone complained about the ""Plantation"" name. Give me a break; can we have more Political Correctness Gestapo members scrutinizing and reporting on everyone's thoughts, words, and actions? I liked being next to the Ala Moana outdoor mall and all of the unique shops, restaurants, and the food court. When traveling, I am not enamored with resort hotels. I can lie around a pool or go to a beach all day just about anywhere close to home, and I do not need to travel 2,400 miles to do so. I like to devote most of my time to driving, enjoying the sites, and participating in activities. Several times, we took visiting mo'opuna to the pool. However, it had too much chlorine, and it closes at sunset for some reason. There is no sauna, nor a smaller or shallower pool for children. I was on vacation, and I did not bring my iPad or laptop, so I cannot comment on the efficacy of the wi-fi signal. Parking costs $20/day and was not an issue, but we were there off-season, beginning 9/16/15.

This hotel is located just a short walk from the convention center, which is great, because it seems to rain every single day. It's also right next door to the Ala Moana Center, which is a huge open air mall (again...rain). So the location is great. That's about all that's great. Service was neutral. Not unfriendly, but not friendly either. My reservation was in order, but no one at the front desk smiles or does anything to make you feel welcome. There was a line to check in, and we waited about 10-15 minutes...it was like an assembly line. ""Next!"" Definitely not a warm welcome. I do have to say, though, that the servers in the restaurant during the breakfast buffet were very friendly and outgoing. Best service in the entire hotel was there in the buffet.The only food I ate in the hotel was the breakfast buffet, three times. The food was substantial and good. Not gourmet, but more than adequate for a quick breakfast. The coffee was GREAT. Loved the coffee.I had a room on the 7th floor of the Kona Tower, which is the tower without balconies. (The Waikiki tower has balconies and is a much taller tower). The rooms, overall, are tired, although very clean. The surface of the desk was very well worn, although it had a nice piece of glass over it, I suppose to extend it's life a few more years. My room had one double bed. The biggest shock was the 1970's quilted bedspread. These frighten me, because I don't imaging they are washed very often. It looked worn and grungy, and I tried not to touch it. There were two teenie tiny pillows that barely covered half the width of the bed. All that said, I have to admit I slept well and the bed wasn't uncomfortable.The bathrooms have been recently re-done with nice tile and materials, but they are beyond tiny. With the bathroom door open, you can't get in or out of the tub without climbing over the toilet. With the door closed, it's claustrophobic.Perhaps the biggest frustration was the WiFi. It's free, but a huge pain to use. I had my laptop, which I could hardwire at the desk, and that was ok, but my iPhone and iPad were so frustrating. The WiFi kept dropping and disconnecting every 5-10 minutes, and every time you reconnect, you have to go to a screen and enter your email address. Between the two devices, I must have typed my email address 200 times over the 5 days. Not good.Overall this hotel wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't great.

There's a bus stop right out front of the shopping centre too which can take you to most spots on the island or up to Waikiki beach, good if you don't want to hire a car.Tip - there are awesome places to eat in the shopping centre!

I used booking.com, and the cheapest rooms were available through luxury suites international (LSI). This is a company that rents out private condos in the hotel. This was a horrible mistake. We arrived and were given the room we asked for (two full beds, ocean view). On the second day we decided to go for a swim, left all of our belongings (except room key) in the room and went down to the pool. After a swim we went back to the room to find that our room keys would not work. This was pretty annoying, but we decided it must just be a malfunction. So we went to the front desk and let them know our keys wouldnt work. They told us LSI made a mistake in booking and they had to give us a different room. Rather then slip a note under my door, send me an email, call me and leave a message, they decide the best solution is to lock us out of our room. Then to change rooms, we had to go back up to our old room escorted by a security guard who came in the room with us while we packed up. He then took us to our new room that was not two beds or ocean view. The hotel blamed LSI and when I called LSI, they blamed the Hotel. LSI was out of the rooms we booked, and the hotel couldn't give us a non-LSI room. I found everyone to be extremely rude and unhelpful during this annoying and embarrassing room change. At no point did one person even offer an apology. On top of all this, the hotel wasn't great on its own, its in a more run down neighborhood and the lobby smelled like mold. I do not recommend this hotel, however if you find you have little other options, absolutely do NOT book through LSI.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Michael C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",10,1.0

It is a good location near but not in Waikiki and easy to get to from the airport and the locations. Being right next to the Ala Moana Mall opens up dinning and shopping options as well.Upon our arrival we were greeted by a front desk clerk with no aloha, I’m glade this was not my first impression of the Aloha State. My wife said something to him and he never made eye contact with her or even acknowledged her. She just walked away I said we would like a quite room as we both needed sleep, his response was “you are on the 27th floor” and finished checking us in.We went up to our room which was across the hall from the elevator, we both thought oh great! As it turned out it has been a quite room with the exception of the first night when there was a party in the room next to us. I took two calls to the desk for Security before the got the message to turn it down.They seem to cater to the flight crews and groups and are less concerned about the independent traveler. The biggest problem we have noticed is that the front desk needs to practice Aloha.

The Bus system for Honolulu literally centers around this location which allows you easy access to the rest of the island, which eliminates the need for a rental car. Walmart is within walking distance as well. I found is very easy to check in, didn't notice any long lines even when I checked out. Bathtubs were very deep and the remodeled room I was in was nice as well but small. The only downside was the noise, because of the location you can hear construction and traffic all the time but I think if you get a higher floor and maybe one that faces the mountains I think that would cut down on that.","Tampa, Florida","KWAJBEAR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",33,3.0

What deserves review, however, is something different: the process required for (particularly) check in, and check out.We tried to check in around 3pm, and were faced with a line that snaked all the way through the foyer, and around the corner! It took one hour and five minutes to make it to the front desk.I am not sure if this is typical, or exceptional - but it is something which we would factor in deciding whether to return. Put simply, after a long flight, and airport processing, the last thing you want between you and the start of your holiday is another excruciating wait.The systems at the front desk appear to be paper based, and labour intensive. there are no options to skip the process (ie no online check in or express check out), so you are really left with a long wait. Frustratingly, the long line gives way to airline staff (who have a separate check in desk), and also front desk staff appear to be required to disappear after each guest is checked in to perform some functions in a back office.We were so concerned about the long waits we checked out an hour earlier than we had to - just to avoid missing our flight. In the end it took 15 minutes to check out - hardly unacceptable, but also way longer than most modern hotels.A suggestion to the hotel:When there are such long lines, have more concern for the guests waiting: can I suggest you offer complimentary water or juice to anyone in the long line? I think it would also be sensible for the hotel to have a staff member out in the foyer, assuring the people in line that they are in the right place, and that the hotel is working to process them as fast as possible.","Wellington, New Zealand","ashtalks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",45,3.0

Our plane arrived late so our rooms where ready when we checked in around 6ish. I was dreading the check in line that I had read about in the reviews but thankfully there was no line. Our room was very clean, full of info ( what to do ,where to eat, how to get a massage), water pressure was great, bathroom clean. It had a fridge, iron, teas, coffee, shampoo, lotion, and a bunch of other little pleasant perks. We were able to get plenty of sleep befor our very early flight. Checked out was quick ( but it was very early bc of flight) then midair our flight had to return bc of sensor issues. Back to the hotel we come. We were able to book rooms for the group fo one more night but this time we were there at 2:30 so only one room was ready. The lines were very long and the flight crew does get special attention. It is frustrating seeing so many flight crew walk right up and get a room before you. Not just one or two but like 12-15 people. Our one desk clerk even left us to check in the flight crew faster. A manager never called extra help for us just let us stand there and watched. We had to point it out before the guy came back to help everyone else. Which worked bad for us bc they wouldn't let us check into our room until exactly 3:00 so we sat there and watched 8 people get checked in early. Lol Guess we should have kept our mouths shut! Then he wouldnt check us in on the group card ( the rest of our group had checked in under the group card. We were the only two people who was made to wait) so we had to use our own card which later was charged even though at check out it was added to the group bill. Our room again was clean just like the 1st room. Our second stay confirmed a lot of the previous reviews. Hopefully these reviews don't fall on deaf ears and something is actually done about customers service & surely our inconvenient wait wasn't purposely done because of our asking to get someone to help the regular people staying at the hotel. I'm confident this hotel is capable of providing excellent service because our first night was just that...excellent.

They have a boat sitting inside the lobby which my son enjoyed. The staffs were also friendly and helpful. Upon our arrival, bellboy offered to carry our luggages and was swift about it. Check in was also fast so we got to our room and rested right away. Our room was also a surprise. It's spacious with 2 full size bed, clean and fully equipped.

We travelled there with a large group and we were in walking distance from everything we needed. Here are my likes and dislikes about the hotel.Liked: The Service - The ladies who worked at the front desk of the hotel were very nice and welcoming as we checked in. They explained everything to us and worked very professionally and with care. Although we were with a big group, it didn’t matter as we were treated with top service.The pool – Although the pool is very small, the attendant that was working that morning was so very friendly. Went to get some towels from him and he was very accommodating.Security – You need a key (room key) to use the elevators. It makes it more difficult for non-guests to get by. There are also security guards walking around making sure everything was okay. I felt safe at night being in the hotel.Clean rooms – Although I just got the basic room, it was well equipped with clean towels and the bathroom was immaculate. The room cleaners really go out of their way to make sure the room is tidy and kept well. After a long day being out, nothing was nicer than to come back to a clean room. Great job!Did not like:The parking – The parking is underneath the hotel and if you have a big car or van, it can be very hard to park it. There is a nightclub and banquet rooms in the hotels where big functions are held and they take up the entire guest parking. There should be guaranteed parking for guests as it gets frustrating trying to park your car when all you want to do is go up to your room after a long day.Overall:Our overall experience at the Ala Moana Hotel was good. The best thing about the Ala Moana Hotel is that the location is prime. Itʻs right outside of the Ala Moana shopping center; the biggest mall on Oahu. Itʻs also about a 5-minute walk from Ala Moana Beach park right across the street.

Then the reception manager told us that our 7 day stay was too long and they couldn't find a room for that long. He said they were so unusually busy (come on this is Honolulu, it's summer and it's ALWAYS busy! That was code for: we're undermanned and are trying to reduce costs) In the end they gave us free breakfast coupons for our entire stay and upgraded our room from mountain view to ocean view. Not bad, but not what you're looking forward to after spending all it takes to come to paradise.Secondly, we are having connectivity problems in the room. We have to reestablish our link a lot. It works good while we're on, but often have to go through the setup over again.On a third point, I asked the Activities/Tours desk about the Sunset cruises and she said that she was filling-in and was very vague with details. 'Cost is between 40 and 80 dollars per person and pick up at the hotel was 4 o'clock or so.' Now how can I plan from that?And also, the vending machine on our floor ran out of water. And, wouldn't return my money. So, now I have to go to a different floor to get water, maybe... and I have to go to the front desk to be refunded.Overall, on the 3rd of a 6 day stay we're having a great time. Hawaii is Hawaii! But, the Ala Moana hotel is definitely not living up to its reputation. They do have a good location, connected to the Ala Moana Mall and the park and beach is just a short walk away.

There were about 30 people waiting to get checked in and only two employees at the counter. It was about 45 minutes before I was served and with no apologies for the wait. This for me is inexcusable at a major and relatively pricey hotel.-The facility is large, sprawling and impersonal. It reminded me of convention centre type hotels elsewhere. Indeed, the honolulu convention centre is down the block. There were many large groups (tour groups, military groups, as well as airline personnel) so the hotel clearly caters to this kind of clientele. -Unbeknownst to me until check-in, the Ala Moana is actually a condominium/hotel and each room is privately owned. What this meant for me as a guest is that there is no housekeeping unless one calls the management company. I didn't like this.-The room is perfectly fine although with some maintenance issues. It is about as generic as you an get and there is nothing at all ""Hawaiian"" or personal about it. In my unit, the shower hook on the bathroom door had obviously been ripped off and the lamp by the bed attached to the wall was improperly secured and kept flipping upside down. The bed is comfortable and there is a little seating area. The 'kitchenette' consists of a microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, mugs, glasses and wine glasses. No cutlery whatsoever, no wine opener, no dishes, no sink. I had a decent view of the hills and partial view of the ocean, as well as a not so nice view of the shopping mall parkade below. With the balcony open, there was quite a bit of traffic noise. The balcony is quite small with only a small table and two chairs. I also wished that there was a screen on the balcony.-Not the best choice if you're primary reason for visiting in the area is proximity to the beach. Since I am a walker this was no issue for me. Waikiki Beach is about a 20 minute walk. However, it is by no means on the beach and certainly not one of those beachfront hotels where one can readily go back and forth between one's room and the beach.

The property is always clean. The rooms are small, the beds are hard, the pillows uncomfortable, and the desk/working area is not ergonomic or ideal for long hours of working. The bathrooms are upgraded, closet space is ample. You have a combination microwave/oven in your room and a fridge. You are far enough away from traffic you will not be disturbed.The primary reason to stay at Ala Moana hotel is for the location. I pass through often on business and am not interested in the beach (though one can readily walk 10 minutes from the hotel to a very uncrowded beach), and I avoid Waikiki as much as humanly possible. The hotel is attached to the Ala Moana shopping center, and I do shop heavily when I pass through. The shopping center is open air and one of the best in the world for finding nearly anything you could imagine from groceries and the post office to high end designers. I can load up on items, and conveniently drop things off to my room, only to go back for more shopping. One can pass out Nordstrom and readily walk down the street also to Wal Mart and Sam's Club.I enjoy the walking I can acquire after many hours of flying -weather you walk the shopping center or to the beach. The shopping center has two locations also for picking up every major bus, and Oahu has excellent public transportation via the bus to anywhere on the island. One can also readily obtain a taxi from the hotel lobby. You are in a key location, away from heaps of tourists, and with ready public transportation.If you are looking for a beach resort, and a romantic room and destination, this hotel will not please you. If you are looking for a great price, at a key location, and can live without walking immediately onto a crowded beach, you'll be fine. If you plan on a few days of shopping, you might even consider staying here a few days, and then relocating to a beach resort.","Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia","Frankie H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia</strong>",21,3.0

I found the rooms the size of a postage stamp with no amenities. The room was clean and the maid was thorough each day. I did have a view of the ocean from the 13th floor. When I went to check in, reception had a difficult time finding my reservation. After much work on the part of Judy, my reservation was found. After checking in there was no one to take my luggage to my room. I had to do that myself. When I wanted to get a snack to eat in the early afternoon, there was nothing available in the hotel. I had to wait until the Signature Restaurant on the 36th floor opened for happy hour at 4:30. During happy hour, the drinks are expensive and the food at the bar is half price. But even that is not inexpensive. The only thing available for breakfast is the Plantation Cafe that serves a buffet from 6:30-10:30. The options are limited but taste good. The price is $16.50. There is no lunch served anywhere in the hotel. If one wants other food options it is a fairly long walk to get to Kalakaua Avenue where the restaurants and hotels are located. If one is interested in shopping that is essentially the same as what they have at home, then this is the place to stay. They have a huge shopping mall adjacent to the hotel that is anchored by Macy’s. If one wants souvenirs or Hawaiiana types of shopping, then this is not the place. I had a car the week that I was there and the valet service was very good. I wanted to go swimming on my free day and was told the beach was a 10 minute walk down by the harbor. What? No pool? I couldn’t find one and no one seemed to be able to tell me if there was one. If you are looking for cheap, then this is the place to stay.

In fact there is direct access to the mall via a pedestrian ramp connecting the two properties.No!! The hotel is not in the Waikiki section of Honolulu, But it is a short walk - about 20 minutes to Waikiki. Or there are trollies and buses you can take.But on the other hand, you have direct access to the shopping mall, which claims to be the largest open-air mall in the world. There we found great shopping and dining. Some will argue that this beats the beach. But then it is easy to access the beach by crossing Ala Moana park across Ala Moana Blvd. a block away. Not a bad location for the hotel in Honolulu.Although the hotel was built in 1969, its age is not apparent. The hotel has been well maintained. It is actually quite modern, comfortable and relatively elegant, although, in our opinion, it is not luxurious. The hotel consists of two towers – the Kona Tower which is about 24 stories and the Waikiki Tower which is about 38 stories – which are connected at each floor.We stayed in the Kona Tower where we found our room to be a bit small but not too small to be uncomfortable – actually it was cozy. Our bath room was modern but typical “hotel” type and size.The front desk staff was fast, efficient, and friendly during check-in and check-out. And they had that “aloha” spirit which made us feel welcomed and appreciated.The hotel has a large, covered, looping, one-way driveway at the entrance. Thus, entering the property and returning to the street was easy which was nice when checking in and checking out - we could do this while not being on Atkinson Street, a very busy street out front. Also, the lobby is quite spacious and nicely decorated. And we found hotel security quite good as we needed out key cards to operate the elevators.As we didn’t have a car, we can’t report on parking at the hotel although, in that the quote a price for parking (we remember $20/night), we assume that parking facilities are available.It offers all the amenities one would expect in an upscale hotel – concierge and activity desk, dining, exercise facility, massage parlor, meeting room facilities, office work station area, gift shop, a great swimming pool, etc. Actually, the prices in the gift shop we found to be surprisingly reasonable where you can by a variety of typical gift shop items but also a nice selection of food items for a gift shop. We found the prices at the restaurant a bit pricey but the food was good.The room rates are reasonable when compared with quality accommodations in Honolulu, particularly in this area catering to shoppers in the Waikiki area. We are not saying that the rates are cheap. But cheap is not in the vocabulary in this part of Honolulu.We note that flight crews from many of the airlines stay here. This leaves us to conclude that the airline flight crews have a preference for the Ala Moana Hotel as it is approximately 7 miles from Honolulu International and in that many hotels are available much closer to the airport. We found this to be a bit interesting. We found that our stay was lots of fun here. But, how can one say otherwise – we are in Honolulu for crying out loud!!","Lahaina, Hawaii","ValhallaIdaho</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lahaina, Hawaii</strong>",19,5.0

Prior to that we had stayed probably seven Christmases and new years in a row. This hotel has always been in a location that I preferred being outside the mad scramble of Waikiki. One thing that may not be made terribly clear to an outsider is that there are two towels to this hotel wangles 12 stories and the other 36. Change between the two is not possible. The hotel itself is pleasant if extremely impersonal. Arriving at reception one seals processed rather than welcomed. Indeed I felt I was just another person filling up yet another room. The room itself is quite small compact would be perhaps a fairer description. It lacks for nothing the bed is extremely comfortable and the air-conditioning is effective but not obtrusive. There was plenty of room for all my clothes which was good as I will be staying for 10 days. There is an extremely large and modern television set, a fridge ,a microwave and a coffee machine. The location is excellent and right across the road is and I'm on a park with excellent beach and the most marvellous viewing for sunsets. The room is serviced every day but it tends to be a bit sporadic in what is left. Some days you get a bath towel Sundays you have to call housekeeping and get one sent up. The same applies to the coffee and tea supplies, sometimes indeed the ice bucket gets a plastic bag other times it doesn't, and just other little details that seem to get overlooked. I know this is a hot climate but on two occasions I've found insects scuttling around the kitchen area of the room. When I reported it the lady on reception clearly didn't believe me and told somebody to come up because the guest thought that he had seen cockroaches. Indeed that is what I think they were but would not swear to it however I did kill one so it's not a figment of my imagination! All the planning and everything else works absolutely fine and was in very good state of repair. Although these sorts of hotels take a tremendous amount of hammering with people coming and going the general condition of the room in particular and the hotel in general is excellent. On the first night I arrived I was so exhausted after the trip out from the UK that I at in the signature restaurant on the top. It was quite perfect but extremely expensive but boasts a fantastic view of Waikiki. As the name suggests it is right next door to the Alamo wanna shopping centre which is interesting to see as it is full of ridiculous luxury shops catering purely to the Japanese market. The bed as I said is comfortable and I sleep very well and all in all enjoying my stay here. It's probably just me but I feel that I have come and gone in this establishment without anyone caring two hoots whether I was here or not. However please don't let this put you off I can recommend this hotel to anybody and it has so much to recommend it. Two of the heights of my day is enjoying the blue sky from my window while enjoying my coffee and the other is enjoying a gin and tonic watching the sunset. Fabulous. I would give this establishment comfortable four stars , but a little more warmth and welcome on the front desk, and attention to detail by the room service staff. I can recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. ","Ipswich, United Kingdom","D9852SZpaulp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ipswich, United Kingdom</strong>",108,4.0

The first is the size of the shower stall. It is an extremely tight fit (I'm not the smallest guy) and I repeatedly bumped my elbow on the handicap handrail. My second complaint is the business center. I needed to print up and then fax a 12 page document that was holding up a substantial financial deal. In order to print anything, I had to log onto the computers in the business center, which cost me around $15 for 5 minutes.

After reading many of the reviews before arriving I became quite anxious as to what to expect, especially since I booked the Kona tower which is the shorter, older tower with ""cozier"" rooms. I arrived at the hotel about 1:30pm and went to check-in, wondering if they'd allow me to or not since I was early. They checked the system and showed my room was ready so they let me check in an hour and a half before 3pm check-in time! I had requested a room on a high floor (which I always do regardless) so they put me on the 11th floor of the 13 story tower. That's perfect for me. I typically ask for rooms on high floors and away from elevators because I prefer quiet -- unfortunately this room was literally across from the ice machine but people didn't seem to use it too much. The only other issue with noise is that you can hear the garbage trucks early in the morning, but keep in mind you are in the heart of a city so city noises are to be expected on occasion. Anyway, the room was very nice and clean, had a mountain view, desk area, couch, arm chair, closet space, microwave, refrigerator, fluffy towels. I walked to the nearby 7-11 and stocked up on some water and other snacks. I found nothing wrong with the room throughout my 5 night stay. I would definitely recommend choosing this hotel if you're on a budget as it's probably cheaper than the Waikiki hotels -- and Waikiki is only about a 15-20 minute walk away - which I walked to and from a few times. You can also walk to the Ala Moana park and beach for some swimming and sunsets. And of course the mall is right next to the hotel, so shopping and eating opportunities galore! Since part of my trip was for a conference I also got to experience the hotels facilities and food service for conferences - which was excellent as well.

I booked this trip to Honolulu rather spontaneously and was looking for a decently priced inclusive tour on Expedia. The Ala Moana was just in the right price range and close to where I wanted to go on the island. Their standard room was small, but had everything in it you need for a few days on Hawaii - really nice to have a microwave and fridge. My room rate came with a breakfast buffet voucher and their breakfast was decent, without being overly exciting or delicious. The fruit selection was probably the best feature. It was also a nice surprise that the breakfast room never seemed crowded, despite the hotel being completely booked over Presidents Day. The nearby Ala Moana Beach Park offers a very well kept sandy beach and great swimming areas. Take your camera and take pictures of the dozen or so wedding couples being there all the time for their wedding pictures..The worst part of the stay at the Ala Moana was their check in. I happened to arrive at exactly 3pm when their check in starts and there were huge lines.

So if you've forgot something, no worries. You've got the ABC and Long's drugs as well as hundreds of other stores to do all of your shopping.The hotel staff was very helpful whenever I had a question. And the location was perfect for Waikiki beach in that it was only a 15-minute walk or a couple of minutes bus ride. It's 2 blocks from a 7-eleven and other ""local"" restaurants if you go away from the beach about 3 blocks and really get out of the touristy areas...My only complaint was that if you get a room in the back tower, you'll hear the garbage/service trucks in the morning, which made it difficult to get back to sleep after they came roaring through. But if you were to stay in the front, 36-story tower, I think that issue would be resolved. That was the reason I gave the hotel a 4 out of 5. If that's not an issue or you book a hotel in the front tower, 5 out of 5 for sure....Also what was great was we spent our last day taking the City/Pearl Harbor tour (leaving the hotel around 6:15 and returning around 5). Well, we had to check out, of course, because we returned too late.

Instead of booking well in advance, I figured I would walk on the wild side of adventure and find new places to stay and review. My first hotel was the New Otani. It is a great beach hotel and under renovation but still nice. Then I moved out to the North Shore and stayed B&B style. Now, my last night in Hawaii I decided to try the Ala Moana. This is a big hotel. They upgraded me to an ocean king room (across from the ice machine and elevators - it happens). The room is big for Waikiki, every room has a balcony. My view was fabulous. The staffers were very nice and happy to chat about the islands. The parking is a little cheaper than many of the hotels around here and you can self-park if you like. The room had a fridge and microwave which might be handy for longer stays. The hotel is attached to the mall so shopping and restaurants abound. Across the street is a yacht club and park. From the mall there are trolly shuttles and The Bus. I have looked at this hotel before and the standard prices are usually a little high for me, but the sale price is usually a good deal - which played into why I stayed this time.

The location is excellent if you plan to shop and it is walking distance to the beach (nice enough to visit, but not ideal for enjoying the beach). The beach area appears to be somewhat 'ghettoish.' Do not have expectations of finding restaurants open on public holidays as everything is closed.

When I arrived at Ala Moana, I was advised that the hotel was fully booked and there is no option to change the room. Initially, I booked a room with two beds, I had a room with a queen (small) size bed. The next day, the staff at the front desk informed me that secret service and military people stayed there and they were fully booked so there were not many options to change. As well, they were expecting 100 people from Quantas. I agreed to pay an upgrade charge to change rooms and was given a room with a better view, but the carpets were stained and this room catered to people with disabilities. I was very disappointed. This is when I became sick. The following day, they assigned me a much nicer room, with two beds (my son was already paying at another hotel), it was difficult for him to cancel his reservations. So in essence, we double paid for accommodations. This hotel is over-priced and staff not very accommodating. North Shore was a beautiful drive, we stopped along the way and bought coconut water, fresh pineapple, papaya and Hawaiian shaved ice.

After a couple of hours we were offered a queen room, rather than the booked king as still wasn't ready, which we took. Hmm. Not a queen size bed. Definitely a double. Not sure if American sizing is different to us, but certainly something to check. I'd be always going for a king where possible, just in case.Pool area was good. Clean but water very cold.

Honolulu prices (with a conference discount, about $175 for a king size bed room). I was there for a conference. I think over priced for room. But isn't that any hotel? Waikiki is about $300 for same type of room.The room is small. Like many hotels. The ""mountain view"" is a mountain view. However, IF one looks down, you will find a gross street view. Busy street with a lot of parking lots. So, don't count on the mountain view. This hotel is a block away from the main Honolulu mall .So if you are there to shop, then you are in close proximity to it. The staff is friendly. The housekeeping is friendly and honest. I left a coat in my room and the housekeeping didn't steal it! :-) They returned it to a friend of mine who lives in Waikiki This hotel is on a main bus line. So you can take a $2.40 bus to downtown Waikiki if needed OR about a $10 cab ride. OR walk to Waikiki area for one (ish) miles. About 2 blocks from the marina Near by restaurants? NOT in the MALL Akasaka sushi (between two ""clubs"" AKA: strip clubs). AWESOME sushi! Delicious, affordable, yum yum yum.Station bar. Two blocks away. Low key bar. Small. Clean. Great service. AFFORDABLE! 678 BBQ (right next to station bar). Be prepared for the line of people. Cheeseburger Waikiki (great happy hour 3-6pm). About four blocks away. It's a chain so find the nearest one to the hotel. BEACH? Yes there is one across the street. It's NOT a ... ""take your breath away beach""/ I want to swim in it, immediately"" But it's near a park (that is a little ghetto). It is right next the the marina. There is a path for people to walk/run. See the sunset there vs. swim in the ocean there. RENT A CAR? Do NOT go through the hotel. It's a price increase. Rent a car AT LEAST one day prior to when you need it through an alternative location. We had to last minute rent same day. So RENT ONLINE and pick up AT LOCATION. It will save you $$$. We could have rented a car online for $45 but we were charged $65 at the enterprise. Another example, that SAME day rental for $65 through enterprise (don't go there... love to scam!) the hotel could get us one for a discount at $85. PLACES TO SEE? Don't like the Waikiki hustle? Go to the north shore: Haleiwi (about 45 minutes). Just go. Trust me. Go to Haleiwi Joes near the marina. Ask what to do. Friendly locals. They'll give you the best of the best. Awesome beaches. Great to watch the waves. Cool waterfall hikes and NOT in the CITY of Honolulu.

We were in the smaller tower with no balcony. The room was small and somewhat dated. However, it was the best deal we could find for the week of New Year's. The location was prefect for us. The Ala Moana mall is across the parking lot and has tons of shopping & dining options (I suggest Mai Tai's on the 4th floor). The mall is supposedly the largest outdoor mall in the states and was incredible. The hotel is also near Ala Moana beech and bus routes to get you anywhere on the island. Waikiki is a 15 minute walk away or you can take the bus. The gift shop at Ala Moana is huge and had everything you need. I suggest skipping the breakfast at Plantations (overpriced & bland) and going to Eggs n Things on the other side of the mall. All of the staff at Ala Moana were great.

Last week my wife had eye surgery and KP.org put us up at the Ala Moana Hotel, hard by the eponymous (and enormous) mall, halfway between downtown HNL and Waikiki. The rack rate quoted for this hotel was $170 and on line they were offering a Kamaaina rate of 139. I guess I don't stay in city hotels very often and when i do I use a search engine like Hotwire or Expedia. There is no way I would pay that much for this hotel. But if you are the sort of person who would, let me relate to you our experience: The hotel is huge with two towers. We were in the Kona tower that ran to a dozen floors. the main tower is bigger. It was clean, check in was pretty fast and check out was handled with a phone call. There is a huge port cochere with a flock of bell people.  As we checked in there were a brace of JAL sterwardi competing for the reception. while there we noted that a large number of the guests were younger Japanese. If you are Japanese and under 25 (and have plenty of money) you may feel very comfortable here. The hotel is connected to the parking lot of the four story Ala Moana mall by a bridge. My wife did so well with her surgery that we had dinner with friends in a nicer chain restaurant, so this was convenient for us. if you like to shop, it might be convenient for you, too.  There was a microwave and refrigerator in our room and the TV worked great. If all this is what you look for on vacation, and you have plenty of money (or someone else is paying for it) The Ala Moana might be just the thing. jeff","Kailua-Kona, Hawaii","jeffrey h</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua-Kona, Hawaii</strong>",199,3.0

My wife and I were in the process of traveling from Honolulu, Hawaii Airport to Newark, New Jersey via United Airlines. Our flight was schedule to depart at 8:30 pm that evening, but experienced mechanical problem with one of the planes flaps. Long story short, we were asked to exit the plane at 10:30pm because they could not fix the problem, and told to pickup our checked bag, and that they would provide us with vouchers for Taxi, Hotel, and a small amount for meals. We were taken to the Ala Moana Hotel, which appeared nice enough from first appearances. Our room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. But, there was nothing else! The room had a mini refrigerator which was completely empty, not even a bottle of water. As we had not eaten at all that evening because of the problems on the plane, and our extended waiting period on the plane, we were hungry. I called for room service, they did not have any! So I walked a couple of blocks to a Seven Eleven, where I picked up a sandwich and a couple bottles of water. So that had to suffice for that night. The next morning, we went to their restaurant at 10:10am for breakfast and were told that the restaurant had closed at 10:00am to accommodate a private party! They informed us that there was an Asian restaurant, but they were not open until 11:00am! I don't know about you, but we're not in the mood for Sushi for breakfast! Asked at the desk regarding this situation, and they were rather uncaring! Told us we could go to the Ala Moana Mall and find someplace to eat there. Again, not breakfast food. So, we packed up, and simply left for they airport to find something to eat there, and while away our time in the club until our flight departed at 7:10pm. So, very unhappy with this hotel! What major hotel doesn't have room service, and no restaurants open in the late morning hours? We will hopefully never have our flight cancelled again when leaving Hawaii, and if we do, hopefully we can obtain a voucher to a ""real"" full service hotel, because the Ala Moana in not!","Trenton, New Jersey","Tomasso-NJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trenton, New Jersey</strong>",32,2.0

There is a convenience store in the lobby that is quite well stocked. A few comments, the tub did not drain when we took a shower, however, I'm sure they would have fixed it if we took the time to let maintenance in.We were there 8 nights. We spent $40 on bottled water because the water is nasty. There is no room service. I highly recommend buying some small coffee filters and ground coffee because the room has the world's smallest coffee pots and its good for about 1-1/2 cups coffee. My room mate and I cajoled the housekeepers to give us an extra pkt of coffee. They do have a low end microwave (it does not pop popcorn!) and I refrigerator in the room. We had a balcony room with an ocean view. The rooms were clean. I was happy when I accidentally spilled some water on the floor by the frig. When I cleaned it up, the cloth came up clean clean clean! There is no movie subscription channels so if you like TV, well, have things to do while the lengthy commercials have their way. Funky small pillows. No extra blankets in room, or robes. No room service. The front desk was unavailable to take my call for check out, after several futile attempts, we just left. Hopefully they will email a copy of my bill. Missing the small things like a magnified mirror in the bathroom. But, they were quick to respond to other requests like towel service etc. Buffet breakfast downstairs. I don't recommend it. It is quite expensive for someone like me who just wants some eggs and fruit. Their food was mediocre at best. Be sure to get your military discount. They do have the option to do the continental breakfast, separately, but my friend didn't think too highly of the pastries. You need to use your room key to go up in the elevator. Security purposes. Probably a good idea. Would I stay here again? Sure, why not. The beds were so, so. The wi-fi didn't work for me.

I was there for a convention and they extended the convention rate through the weekendbad I am a Sabbath observer and used the hotel as it was near a synagogue i was going to use for prayers. The hotel did move my room to a lower floor (the convention had filled the hotel; and when i checked in there were no lower floors available) as i was on 17 and climbing 17 floors is a little tough. However when i asked them where the stairwell was they told me I can only use the stairwell until the 3rd floor. There was stairwell down to 1 but that opened into the back and needed a guard to let me in or out. when i replied that i had been told that they had street access they told me they stopped that and the only way i could get stair access from three to one was if i hired a guard privately.I have traveled around the world at anywhere form 2 to 5 star hotels, some had accessible stairwells some needed a door unlocked. I have never been told i need to hire my own guard and never been accommodated. I do not know how much a guard cost but i ended up leaving 3 nights early as i did not want to bother the Rabbi from the synagogue and after 4 days at a conference did not want to go hotel shopping.I am sorry they were so unaccommodating as other aspects of the hotel were pleasant. If and when i go back to Hawaii I will not be staying here. I will look for a Hotel that is willing to go a little bit extra to accommodate the needs of the clients. As an aside i found that I could get out on the third floor by going through the pool area, ergo the only accommodation they would have had to make was to have a guard walk me from the first to the third floor Friday night and Saturday afternoon and how much time would that have taken.

Its a huuuuuge property. Over 1,000 rooms so the service can be a bit cold-- turn & burn. Staff is by no way at fault though: There's just no possibility they can deliver the quintessential Hawaiian experience--that ""aloha"" at such a big place. Lots of flight attendants stay here too. They were kind of a downer when we encountered them in the lobby. Couldn't tell which airline. You probably won't get to know anyone except maybe your housekeeper, concierge, folks at the restaurant. Front desk was always busy-- no time to chat. The lines were a bit long, but checkin and checkout interactions efficient. Completely forgettable though, and I couldn't tell you anyone's names. Rooms are clean, functional, small. They all have microwaves, even the little units. This is actually rare for Honolulu hotels. The Kona tower rooms can only accommodate 2 people. Its EXTREME close quarters. I almost died when I walked in... but its what I booked! Definitely should have checked square footage but was too taken by the price tag. Dad and I stayed together in this one and it was not comfortable. Maybe it'd be ok for a couple that gets along well. Only book this if you're travelling alone, or on a tight budget, or both.Comparatively, the one-bedroom suites: much better with room to stretch out. Good to have a living area. However its still very basic and feels small for the price. Furniture, wallpaper, flooring: clean and maintained but underwhelming in design, and outdated, slightly worn. The small suites here remind me of the big studios at the Ilima Hotel in Waikiki--similar minimalist décor. Speaking of the Ilima... parking is free, and even their studios feature a full kitchen (I don't know of any other Honolulu hotels with free parking) Ala Moana is 20/25 a night self park or valet. Alternatively If you can find a one-bedroom at the Embassy Suites or Aqua Luana for around the same price, its a no-brainer to take the latter option. Rooms are upgraded and sleek with modern Hawaiiana style. Smaller properties too, so staff are caring and attentive. What sets the Ala Moana Hotel apart is its location: Right at the doorstep of the huge Ala Moana mall, and five-minute walk to Hawaii Convention Center. About a mile away is Ward shopping area and movie theater. In my opinion the best part is that Magic Island and Ala Moana beach park is right across the street. Compared to Waikiki beaches, is definitely less crowded, with larger stretches of sand and nice picnic areas. Its tons quieter, and better in most ways but less ""manicured"" compared to Waikiki's tropical landscaping and granite-paved walkways. Keep in mind this area has no rental kiosks for umbrellas/chairs or beachboys to give surf lessons. Don Quijote is the best for walking distance groceries. Walmart and Sam's Club also nearby. Rumours nightclub is downstairs, and Pearl nightclub is just across the mall, if that's your thing. Leaps and bounds better than any Waikiki clubs. If you're more low-key and into dives, there are good options both here and in Waikiki. Dining options are also comparable. If you're really roughing it and taking city buses, all major lines stop here. If you're vacationing though...don't do it. Its miserable to go more than a few miles in any direction. The concierge can recommend tours/activities, and the best ways to experience Hawaii and its culture. One small room feature I liked: breezy cotton robes. Its is too hot for bathrobes here, so even higher end properties don't seem to offer them: this is the perfect alternative that I wish more places had. Good job Ala Moana. The small extras make a difference.Wouldn't be my first choice, but I'd stay again and recommend, especially if they have rates that will hold up to the other hotels.","Honolulu, Hawaii","DisgracedPuppy7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",26,3.0

We are usually in a Ocean View on the 35 floor room. The upgraded suite was on the 7th floor overlooking the shopping center parking lot. Finally a very nice receptionist allowed us to look at some different rooms and finally ended up in a ocean view room but with two beds. So add insult to injury when I was browsing on line thinking of having a daughter come spend a day or two with us. I discovered the same room I had booked 2 months ago for $209 was now $169 a night and when I asked the front desk said they could not give us the better rate.

Honestly, I don’t think any of the rooms have a true ocean view. There are a collection of tall hotel rooms that are between us and the ocean. My room had a sliding door, which I assumed would be a balcony but instead you open the sliding door and it’s just a rail.

I’m about 5’7 and I could touch the ceiling in the bathroom. And I’m not talking about on my tip-toes either. Standing normally, I lift my head up and my fingers touch the ceiling. This was more problematic in the shower. The shower is slightly elevated. I kept hitting my hand on the ceiling every time I lifted my arm to wash my armpit.The bed was comfy and if it wasn’t for the jetlag, I would have slept pretty well every night.

I'm a musician, traveling around the world. Visited this hotel for the business and experienced the worst service in the world. Women in the front desk are terrible as other people reviewed here, they don't communicate with people even in a normal way with common sense. One day, I found that I had lost my room key. I was sure that was around the lobby so I called them from out of the hotel and requested to void my key since the key was in an envelope with my room#. The answer of the front desk was ""We cannot. Come back to the hotel, bye."" WOW!? Called them again and requested the manager and they connected to manager's voicemail. WOW (2nd time) Called them again and asked if they'd pay all my staff if somebody breaks into my room and steal and mentioned them I was ready to call 911 now. Finally voided my key. How come it took so long for this simple thing?Next day, I enjoyed some beautiful beach sun and walk and went back to the hotel for business meeting of 1.5 hour later. Then my room key didn't work.... I returned to front desk and asked a woman with doing nothing in the ""airline clue only desk"". I said this is super urgent because I'm leaving in 1.5h and explained the situation she said ""wait in the regular line."" ""WOW(3rd)"" then I explained the situation AGAIN and she said ""YOU need to leave NOW because your departure day is today on our computer."" ""That's not true, my other business members are all in the hotel and we are leaving tomorrow."" ""NO, you have to leave today because our computer blah blah"" I was like WOW! (4th) What is really wrong is this hotel.... and said ""Call manager."" He came, confirmed that was their mistake, issued my key again. I went back to my room, the key didn't work AGAIN. Back to the front desk, ""The key doesn't work. Can you call the manager again?"" and the same rude lady sighed and said ""WAIT (with frustrated and annoyed face with glaring at me)"" How could you just say ""wait"" with the face to the customer in this situation. I won't forget her name..They reissued my key but there was only 10 min left so I had no time for shower. They didn't even give me any drink or breakfast ticket as the apology (of course I didn't request that but other hotels do give some voucher if any terrible thing like this happen. That is normal.) Other members in my business group were also experiencing full of this kind of terrible service. I highly recommend avoiding this hotel if you don't want to ruin your beautiful Hawaii trip.

So I used the lobby restroom (overflowing garbage, rolls of toilet paper loose in the stall, dirty) and then grabbed some food across the street at the Ala Moana Center.

I was really looking forward to spending some time enjoying the pool side area and getting some sunshine. A group of about 20 people came up to the pool several of them got in the pool in their clothing and the rest make it began to make a lot of loud noises and wave their arms overhead. It appeared to be some sort of religious ceremony. This went on for a good 15 to 20 minutes at which point most of the other guests got up and left. Myself and my friend stayed however we called the front desk and security to ask if they could please come and do something, as this behavior was not only loud rude and disruptive but borderline offensive. One of the women in this group approach myself and my friend and ask us what our problem was. when I explained that they were being loud and disruptive she proceeded to call myself and my friends names tell us that we were the devil that we were going to hell that we would never be saved and never be blessed. I got up and went to call the front desk again while this woman continue to be right my friend. After five calls we still have seen no sign of security and that's when one of the men in the group came over and said in a very menacing way if you have a problem you talk to me. At this point I went back inside for a fifth time and called and asked to speak with the manager. Someone named Darrell said that he would send security up and I explained to him that security was already there and doing absolutely nothing. I left the pool area at this point to go see Darryl myself downstairs at the front desk. When I got there they told me you're going upstairs to the pool deck. When I arrived back to the pool deck the group of people were now surrounding him and waving their hands in the air and apparently praying over him. Then one of the women became over and addressed me. She called me a liar and said that none of the unkind things that her party had done had happened. She continued to tell me that I was troubled that I was a troublemaker that I was the cause of the issue and I was the one upsetting all the hotel guests. Meanwhile the manager and the security guard stood by doing and saying absolutely nothing. I was at this point I dissolved in tears. All I wanted to do was enjoy the pool and get some sunshine and relax on my vacation. That has been totally taken away from me. If I could leave and go home right now I would. Unfortunately my flight is not until tomorrow. It's very unfortunate that the management here is so incompetent. I am a travel agent and I will never ever book this hotel again.

If you are looking for a hotel close to the Convention Center or Ala Moana Shopping Center, or to save a few bucks from what you would pay closer to Waikiki Beach, then this hotel might work for you. No complaints with the rooms (although smaller than average) or staff. The biggest plus for me was the sauna and steam bath in the fitness center.Apart from being close to the Convention Center and shopping mall, this hotel is not close to much else of interest unless you are interested in having an ""oriental massage"" at one of the ""relaxation spas"" at the end of the block. The walk to Waikiki Beach is about 20-30 minutes.What could be improved? Let's start with the elevator key cards. It had been two years since I had last been to Ala Moana and it is still a problem. Had to have my key cards replaced twice. Apparently, the hotel does not think there is a problem since there has not been any improvement in that time. What else? Except for the weak brew available in the room, the only choice for coffee for early risers is to walk to the nearby 7-Eleven (next to the massage parlors). The hotel would do well by its guests to put in a coffee shop or at least a coffee bar in its under-utilized retail space. One obvious area of neglect is the hotel restaurant -- The Plantation Cafe. The faded lettering on the sign for the restaurant is the first clue. This restaurant is only open for the buffet breakfast. The plate size is small and there are not many choices at the buffet. Describing the breakfast at the Plantation Cafe as mediocre is being kind. With there being no other choices nearby (not counting the 7-Eleven), the hotel apparently believes that it does not need to put forth much effort towards the breakfast experience for its guests. Instead of cold waffles, how about having a waffle maker? Or perhaps an attendant to cook made to order omelettes? Or a greater diversity of selections? My last suggestion would be to install a couple of television screens in the fitness center or better yet have equipment with screens on them.","Silver Spring, Maryland","RKerry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",11,3.0

Hotel staff are friendly & informative.The ordinary part of this hotel - the rooms are on the touch smallish for American hotels. Not Much room to move. The bathroom too is small. Room & bathroom is relatively clean & tidy. We had a room overlooking the car park which isn't much to look at. Given room sizing & views our intention was not to spend too much time in the room.

We have stayed at this hotel before and had a good room with a decent view. Not this time! The first room we were given had two double beds so that wasn't going to fly! I called the front desk and they moved us to another room at the other end of the hall. It was a handicapped room! The door has a mechanism on it to help wheelchairs get in and out the door.........but you have to wait outside your door when you leave to make sure it shuts securely. Neither of us are wheelchair bound so it was kind of hilarious! The upside is that the bathroom was configured bigger to accomodate a wheel chair......but the downside is that a balcony is supposedly an ""upgrade"" yet mostly what we could see was the side of the hotel and parking lots. If you leaned over the railing, you could see some of the mountains........but I wouldn't recommend leaning very far.... we were on the eleventh floor! The hotel has 36 floors in all. It would be nice if this hotel upgraded their beds. They are not comfortable and we got neck and back aches. They only have queen size beds too! The shower worked great and had plentiful hot water. The fitness center is nice, but the sauna was out of order, and the pool area really needs to be updated. In room internet is free, but in order to print out boarding passes, you have to pay a fee! We opted to just do it at the airport! Parking is expensive at $20.00 per day for self parking, but parking is scarce in Waikiki so if you rent a car, look for places that have parking. One advantage to this hotel is it's connection to the Ala Moana Shopping Center. You can walk there from the second floor of the hotel so that is very convenient. There is great shopping and a big food court. Too bad this mall doesn't have a movie theater in it, but the closest stadium seating theater is not too far away by the Ward Center. The beach is across the street and past the park, so not too bad for walking if you don't have too much to carry. For the price, I guess you get what you pay for and we will undoubtedly stay there again, hoping for a better room with a better view!","Kihei, Hawaii","Maryl54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kihei, Hawaii</strong>",79,3.0

Luxury Suites? This company manages units in this hotel that are privately owned but are available for rent to the public. Check-in and out is at the Ala Moana Hotel's front desk but housekeeping, etc., is not handled by hotel personnel but contracted by Luxury Suites. Because of this, my unit was not up to the standards of the hotel's regular units. There was no shower mat, the soap was not wrapped (it was used by the previous guest, yikes!), the phone book was several years old, shower handle pulled off easily and the toilet tissue dispenser was broken off the wall. Definitely not what I expected. / The hotel itself has been renovated and very comfortable. For non-tourists. This is a great location. It is located adjacent to the Ala Moana Shopping Center which is Hawaii's largest and boasts a large number of stores and restaurants. There's a large food court for the budget traveler. Ala Moana Beach Park is just two blocks away so walking to the beach is a snap. If you're looking for tourist action, hula shows and the like, you would need to take a cab or drive to Waikiki which is a 1 - 2 miles away. Warning, rush hour traffic is horrific so plan accordingly. All in all, except for the issues mentioned which you should not encounter if you booked directly with the Ala Moana Hotel, this is a great and convenient hotel to stay.

We live on another island in Hawaii, and we weren't in Honolulu just to shop and hang out at the beach. OK, I know the room might not be ready until 3pm. That's understandable and a stated policy. But the lady Iwalani at check-in was somewhere between matter-of-fact and unpleasant, told us we could go to the mall, and then abruptly called ""Next!"" to dismiss us. It wasn't a good start. Don't expect a lot of aloha from Iwalani. After mostly just sitting and shopping at the adjacent mall, we returned at 2:30 and a much nicer and friendly lady Barbara got us into our room with a smile. We were on the 9th floor, which is about where you want to be. The view is OK and the elevator time is short. Stay in Waikiki Tower. Others in our group in the Kona part didn't have rooms as nice or new. All appliances worked well; the room and bathroom were clean; and the wifi connection worked well enough to stream video, although we did have to re-log in more often than once every 24 hours, The swimming pool is excellent. Salt water. Clean. Warm. It closes at sunset, however.$20/24-hour parking for guests is a rip-off that added $40 to our final bill. But this is Honolulu, so one must just assume such costs.The location is a bit bipolar: It's only about a 15-minute walk at most to the southeast to the posh part of Waikiki, although with small kids be advised this involves negotiating a complicated and busy intersection. Just to the north of the hotel, however, and even in view from north-facing rooms, are lots of strip clubs, massage parlors, men hanging around in groups on the sidewalk in front of a convenience store, etc. We happened to walk that way once -- not again! -- because our daughter wanted KFC and that's the direction it lies in. She's personally seen poverty in Third World countries before, but it was still not pleasant walking by garbage piles and a couple people who were engaged in spirited, angry conversations with invisible partners.Food. Four local options: 1) Food court at mall. 2) Spend fortune in hotel. 3) Spend bigger fortune in posher Waikiki hotels and restaurants down the road. 3) Expose your family to the sights, sounds and smells of the homeless on the way to a kind of Asian strip mall where KFC is; 4) be part of a group that has meals otherwise arranged. We had option 4. You probably won't.We had a decent group rate for this trip. Maybe we would stay there again if we had to pay the regular price, but one friend got the same rate at a hotel right on Waikiki beach, so we'll certainly shop around first.","Hilo, Hawaii","Jeffrey P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilo, Hawaii</strong>",39,3.0

While it lacks the elegance of some of the more upscale hotels on Ala Moana Blvd. and it doesn't have the dining options of other nearby hotels, the location is priceless. In town for conferences on my last two visits to Hawaii, the Ala Moana is located just across the street from the Hawaii Convention Center and it's essentially adjacent to to the Ala Moana Center.With a grand lobby that boasts plenty of seating and even a tranquil area, the Ala Moana is a large hotel with two towers and over 30 floors. We stayed in the Waikiki tower and we were upgraded to an ocean view, which was actually more of a view of docked boats and a sliver of the water. But, I can't really complain about the upgrade as it was a nice gesture and we didn't really spend too much time in the room.The check-in and check-out processes were relatively seamless and the service was quite good. The rooms were cleaned well daily and the housekeeping staff was very attentive. The rooms there are simple but they get the job done. We had two beds, a desk, a couple of chairs, a balcony, a mini refrigerator, a microwave and a large flat screen TV.If you're looking for a decent hotel that's convenient to the convention center, attached to the Ala Moana Center, a short walk to Waikiki beach, shopping on Kalakaua and Kapiolani Ave, then the Ala Moana Hotel may be a good fit.

It couldn't be further away from the beach, restaurants and hustle and bustle of what Honolulu has to offer. If you have children or on holidays forget about booking this hotel. Despite the Ala Moana Mall being right next door, there is only so much shopping and eating out of the food court and few restaurants in that complex you can handle. You can catch the pink line trolley from Waikiki for the day for only $2 and I would suggest this. The customer service is terrible, we asked at reception and they were unable to suggest anywhere to get a meal other than there in-house restaurant or the food court at the mall also asked about wi-fi and was basically ignored.

If you are a family, don't consider it. The closest beach is Ala Moana Beach Park and it's not family-friendly. If you feel like giving your kid a crash course in why people are homeless, or why some people yell at their kids incessantly threatening to smack them, that's your beach. The adjacent bus stop that takes you to Waikiki is usually taken up by homeless people sleeping on the benches. There are strip clubs right behind the hotel. I understand Honolulu has a homeless problem and I totally empathize as I don't know the right solution, but it's not where I want to take my family on vacation. If you just want to come and shop at the adjacent Ala Moana mall, the location is perfect.Regarding the hotel, it's a cattle car. They try to cram as many people in as possible. They don't have enough elevators nor do they have enough parking. People park illegally all over the parking garage as there aren't enough spaces because the hotel crams guests in like a cattle car. The hotel hosted a ton of military for RIMPAC and there was no additional security. It felt very vulnerable. Housekeeping was mostly fine but didn't replace sugar or Sweet & Low for coffee for 3 days. Only 1 pack of coffee for 2 adult guests per day.

Mostly becuase it is right next to the mall, and a few blocks from Walmart or any other shopping you may need. Kwajalein does not have a lot of variety, so getting some groceries from the store in the mall or Walmart is great.Second, there is a price disparity between what is offered at this hotel based on how you booked your stay. There are a lot of rooms that are owned not by the hotel but by other people who then rent them out at different prices. Those rooms when booked through sites like Priceline or Hotels.com are normally the ones owned by other people and not the hotel. This makes a differance in your quality of stay. If the person who owns the room does not hire someone to clean it on a regular basis you may not find it clean, and the one time I did rent the ""condo"" it had a roach there to great me. These rooms often rent for about $170 a night. And any diparities or uncleanliness you find in the room the hotel has nothing to do with it and will not help you.Third if you do book from the hotel website I recomend the Wakiki tower. This is the taller tower and the elevators to access it are right in the hotel loby next to the front desk. If you book the Kona tower it may be cheaper around $180-$210 per night but you have to drag your suite case across carpeting for almost 50 yards or more in order to get to the Kona tower elevators. I hate doing this because my suitecase is often heavy and gets stuck in the carpeting or drags considerably, so it is like pulling a 50 pound weight instead of rolling it. Honestly the hotels rooms owned by the hotel are clean and quite and I do not have a single complaint about those features. The thing that I do not find pleasent is the sticker price. The Waikiki tower rooms range from $190 to over $300 dollars. There are a lot of cheaper hotels that have the same quality rooms for less. If you stay here it is really just for the location. All of my prices mentioned are before taxes and fees.One other thing. They try to sell you on the inclusion of breakfast at their cafe, but I have yet to eat there even though I had the tickets. The food may be fine, but the line in the morning for breakfast is so long that it could take an hour before you get to the door. I have waited at least 45 minutes and gotten close but gave up when i was told it would still be a 20 minute wait. It was faster and perhaps better to eat at a local restaurant. Okay a final note: This hotel is used for airline delays and the pilots and crew. So you may have a nice quite hotel one night and a very busy and disgruntaled group of travelers the next due to some flight delay that caused the airline to give them a hotel voucher. This may make your wait in the loby's line rather long but if you avoid the loby and go out through the ramp to the mall you can avoid the lines. I also recomend calling the front desk instead of going down there durring these occations if you need something.","Pyeongtaek, South Korea","spcredoni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pyeongtaek, South Korea</strong>",26,3.0

I went to the front and found a line with 12 people waiting to check in. So, i asked the concierge if she could just help me reprogram my key so i could go to my room. ""No, you have to wait in line."" Really? So, I asked one of the other people at the front desk. ""No, you have to wait in line."" I gave up after 20 minutes of fuming, woke up my significant other, and had him come down and get me. When i finally did get my key reprogrammed, she told me i had probably put it next to my phone.

We checked in about 2.30pm, avoiding the 3pm rush in evidence when we went back to reception to get our second door keycard enabled. When we got served, the rather snotty reception member immediately said ""you must have had it near a phone"" which was ridiculous and wrong, both had been the only things in my shirt top pocket. One card did not work from the get go, trying to get to our floor in the elevators, or opening the room door. So our first impression was pretty negative.The room was a king bed high floor with views, and that was fine thought the entire building is showing its age and was just adequate. An annoying aspect was that while the rooms have a microwave and small fridge, they are devoid of any glassware, plates, cutlery, no bottle opener, nothing. Housekeeping did deliver 2 wine glasses on request, but we had to buy a corkscrew/bottle opener with a bottle of wine over at the nearby shops.Overall our description of the hotel is ""just adequate"", the king bed fine and shower good to use, a small but functional balcony - with an exhortation that smoking anywhere including the balcony would incur a $200 cleaning fee. But don't expect anything extra like much friendliness or flexibility from the staff, and our second encounter with reception was memorably bad.One final plus is the little shop, quite hidden on the lobby level, which sells lots of nibbles and drinks, fruit and all sorts of bits and pieces for travellers, and is staffed by the most friendly and helpful staff.

(When I waited seven minutes this spring at the Marriott in Baltimore because the computer was down, I received a hand written note of apology and chocolate bars, but I digress.) Then, for the three of us, we were given a skanky, small room, replete with someone else’s hair on the pillow of the only bed, a double, with views into the apartment complex a few feet away. In my jet lagged and near-tears state, it dawned on me that we had not been give the correct room in the Tower that we had reserved. When they reassigned us, what a world of difference! The room was clean, spacious, nicely appointed in contemporary Hawaiian décor, and best of all, had a spectacular 180 degree view of downtown Honolulu from mauka to makai (mountain to sea) with a glimpse of Diamondhead in the background. Having coffee on our upper floor balcony each morning was sheer delight. Honestly, that was the most schizophrenic hotel experience I have ever had.

Finally, the location is hard to beat—away from the sheer density of tourists on Waikiki (but located at its northern end near the yacht club) and next to the splendid Ala Moana open air shopping mall with its restaurants, wonderful Foodland for groceries, and $4 Mai Tais at the rooftop bar (aptly named Mai Tais) on Mahalo Mondays (with terrific live music and good pupus as well!) The crowd next door shopping is decidedly tony and international, so it is also a blast for people watching.

I did not have many expectations before leaving home, but I did read some reviews just to get an idea. I know hotels in the USA are very different than hotels back home when it comes to service. You just get what you paid for, and dont get the extra friendliness from hotel staff. I wont say that this was a great hotel, but I have nothing to complain either. For me, this was just a place to sleep over. The hotel is close to the shopping area, with a bridge connecting to the Ala Moana Center. Lots of eating places nearby. And since I like walking a lot, I enjoyed the 15-20 minute walk to Waikiki, you can also take the Waikiki trolley at the mall ($2 one way, or even better get a $38 one-day pass form4 different bus routes). I read some reviews mentioning that the rooms at Kona Tower were small, but I don't think that was a big problem for me.

It was large and had a great balcony. The bed was really comfortable, and the room had a large flat-screen TV with many channels. It also had a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.My complaint is with the way the hotel sells some of its rooms to individuals and other corporate entities. Rather than being owned by the hotel itself, my room was owned by Luxury Suites International, based in Las Vegas. When I checked in, I was told that if I had any problems or issues with the room, I needed to call this company's hotline (but no later than 7pm Las Vegas time, if I remember correctly) as the Ala Moana Hotel management was not responsible for my room and could not help me with any problems I might encounter.Thankfully, I had no major issues. At one point, I couldn't locate the broadband plug in the room (but there must have been one since they did have a broadband cable). I ended up being able to connect to wi-fi with no problem, so it wasn't a big deal, but they told me at the front desk that I would have to call Luxury Suites International to get any help locating the broadband plug. I recommend this hotel, but it might be a good idea to verify first whether the room you're getting is actually an Ala Moana Hotel-owned room or one owned by some other entity, for if it's one like mine owned by some other entity, any problems you might have would not receive any immediate attention from the hotel staff.","Singapore, Singapore","Mark Fifer S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",37,3.0

Visitors need to do their research and know what they are getting before booking a room here. Ala Moana is an excellent alternative to the craziness and congestion of Waikiki. The hotel is at the entrance to Waikiki and offers better, more plentiful and economical shopping and dining options in the adjacent Ala Moana mall. The hotel is connected to the mall by a skybridge on the 2nd floor of the hotel. If you are on a budget, be aware that the Kona tower rooms are tiny, and though more economical, we never stay in that section. You will be happier if you pay the extra $10-$20 and book the Waikiki Tower. The higher the floor, the better your view and quality of room. There were 7 in our party. My dad had a handicap room on the 6th floor which was perfect for his needs. My husband and I were in room 2814. The room was in excellent condition. The walls seemed to have been freshly painted. Our king sized bed was firm. There was a sofa bed and armchair in the room. Water pressure in the bath/shower was good. Flat screen TV, microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, all seemed new. Only 3 pillows on the king bed, which was okay for us, but they will bring you more pillows if you ask. The TV channels had the usual cable lineup, including Showtime and HBO, as well as Japanese programming (for the many Japanese guests). We ate at the hotel's Plantation Cafe one morning. Breakfast buffet is $16 which is cheaper than most of the Waikiki hotels and though not outstanding, it was totally fine for us--the usual eggs, bacon, waffles, pastries, etc.. I think you can buy coffee to go in the restaurant up until they close. Breakfast runs daily from 6:30 to 10 a.m. You can even get the buffet to take out. I can understand why the hotel does not have more restaurant options given their proximity to the ginormous Ala Moana mall. The food court at the mall opens at 8 a.m. There is a 7-11 convenience store just a block down the road in front of the hotel--and of course, it's open 24/7. The Wailana Coffee Shop which is down the road, across from the Hilton on Ala Moana Blvd. is a great place for breakfast---the best blueberry pancakes--and inexpensive. The hotel parking lot is small and it can be confusing trying to find your car. At $20 a day for self-park it is not cheap, but still cheaper than Waikiki where parking averages $30 or more. I think it's funny to hear people complain about paying $20 a day. This is typical for a big city and major resort!Price-wise, the Ala Moana hotel is a solid choice, more so for locals though, since we got an oceanview room for $169 at our Kamaaina rate. We could have booked a mountain view suite for $249, but the oceanview room was perfect, as the lanai (w/two chairs plus table) was shaded all day. We had a great view of Waikiki, the boats in Ala Wai harbor and Ala Moana beach park. The room was quiet even though the hotel was fully booked the weekend we were there. I did not hear any of our neighbors. Personally, I enjoy staying outside of Waikiki. I've stayed at several hotels in Waikiki over the years and the Ala Moana hotel always offers excellent value---but just don't expect much if you choose the Kona tower. You'll probably be happy in any category room in the Waikiki tower as long as you are on one of the higher floors. You will get what you pay for! Be careful if booking your room through a vacation rental company, as those rooms are not necessarily going to be on par with the hotel's rooms. Our party had 4 rooms booked through the hotel and all of them were in excellent condition. I book directly through the Outrigger.com website.","Honolulu, Hawaii","pamjohnson808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",6,5.0

Still, I work for a resort hotel, and $ 200.00 per night is not unacceptable in any major city. Though a private condo, it is within the Hotel, and I can tell that all hotel units are similarly furnished. The main attraction to this hotel is that it is part of the Ala Moana mall complex. My preference would not be for a high rise hotel in the future, now that I am more familiar with the area. Can't fault the location though. Actually, can't fault the hotel either. One sign is that a lot of airline flight crews stay here, meaning that it is not top of the line, but certainly acceptable. They have a top floor Signature steak and seafood restaurant, that was very noisy, albeit popular in the cocktail hour, notwithstanding the fact that it faced away from the sunset. Probably a local's watering spot. Their associated breakfast cafe is a buffet style, and completely acceptable. Many interior spaces are vacant, with promises of future tenants, such as a spa, etc. Realtor's ads in the elevator suggest it has been fairly recently renovated, which may account for the empty commercial spaces within.","Loveland, Colorado","owlish1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Loveland, Colorado</strong>",30,4.0

There are 3 restaurants. The staff was efficient and pleasant. The downside, if you can call it that, is that the hotel is busy, usually bustling with activity.

The owner of the sailing school recommended that I stay at the Ala Moana Hotel. I looked for the Ala Moana Hotel via the website Booking.com and I made a booking for three nights stay in a room at the hotel. The hotel seemed to have what I required.However felt I there was something strange about the booking when I received email confirmation that stated the cost was US$ 388.05 and the number of guests would be 2 adults and 2 children. I responded immediately and restated that I was travelling alone. I received a confirmation response, for a modified reservation. When I arrived at the hotel the receptionist at the front desk informed me that the hotel could check me into the room, however the hotel would be in no way liable for my stay as my booking had been made through a company that owned condominiums. She further stated that I could not use the hotel services or other facilities provided by the hotel as I was a client of Luxury Suites International. LSI are a company based in Las Vegas USA. As a woman travelling on my own I prefer to use the facilities of a hotel such as room services, etc. The receptionist telephoned LSI whose response to me was that they had already taken my money and there was nothing that could be done. At that time the Ala Moana hotel was fully booked. So I reluctantly went up to the condo and found that two of the lights in the room were not working and there was no safe in the room. One of my first requirements in a hotel room is the use of a safe for my valuables, etc.I repeatedly tried to contact LSI on a number I later found out to be in Las Vegas. The Ala Moana hotel discharged responsibility for the situation. After many calls to the hotel reception, they found me a room in the hotel. The hotel charged me $30 for ringing LSI from the hotel phone. I did receive at least three calls from the Customer Service dept of Booking.com. I had left several messages for the LSI people but they wouldn't take my calls. I informed them by voice mail, that I had checked out of the condo and into the hotel. I have paid $780.31 US dollars to the Ala Moana hotel, for three night’s stay, which I was happy to pay because I was comfortable in my room and it had the facilities I was looking for in the first place.

The room was clean, comfortable, with a good bed, small kitchen area and even a couch/table and chair inside with a sitting area. The room was impeccably cleaned everyday and one my biggest comments about hotels of this era is usually the quality of the air and air conditioning units. Often they are noisy and start/stop to maintain the room temperature - and this was the opposite - very good overall. The pool area and gym area was well appointed and the towel service which we used everyday for the beach was excellent.Access to the Ala Moana Mall is the best - I don't think you could be any closer to the best shopping in Hawaii, with more parking than you'll ever need. There's also valet parking for a small fee and if you don't mind walking a short distance, you can also find free overnight street parking.The added bonus was the access and proximity to the Ala Moana Park which is directly across the street. For those that enjoy swimming in the ocean, there is a dedicated 1000 metre swimming lane at the beach that's 100% protected from the waves. You can walk to the main Waikiki Beach area in about 10 or 15 minutes.The Happy Hour at the The Signature Restaurant on the top floor of the hotel was an added bonus. Good food, drink and one of the best views in Honolulu.Special thanks to Judy Pereira and GM Bill Comstock for handling a tough situation when the reservation system crashed on this deal offer.I would definitely recommend this hotel.",canada,"scratchcat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>canada</strong>",54,5.0

Though nobody was rude, almost everybody seemed trained to operate efficiently rather than warmly. The only exception was the bar tender at the Signature Restaurant on the top floor.

(We were not at the main Convention Center, but that was literally five minutes away, so this hotel would be an excellent choice for anyone attending an event there.) The service was wonderful; my hairdryer didn't work and Housekeeping brought up a new one within 5 minutes of my call and made sure that it worked. Same thing when I came in and the clock was flashing 12:00 and I couldn't set it (but why do hotels furnish rooms with clocks that are impossible to set? I couldn't set the alarm either!). And the front desk staff are friendly and helpful, both when checking in and out, and when I intially had a problem connecting to the Internet; there is wireless in the rooms and also the typical connections.The rooms are small, but you're not sitting in your room in Honolulu, and the small fridge and microwave are useful, especially as the hotel cafe served only a buffet breakfast, so I stocked up on yogurt and fruit from the local ABC shop. There is a convenient food court in the Ala Moana Shopping Center next door, and an easy second-floor passage from the hotel. The pool hours were limited to 8 a.m. to sunset, so no early morning swim, which was a disappointment, but again, it's an easy walk to the Ala Moana beach, which is preferable to the pool if you have time. A friend raved about the massage she got at the first floor center; they will also come to your room.If you are planning to spend most of your time at Waikiki, then this is not the hotel for you, unless you want to do the 20-25 minute walk every day (I did not try to find the shuttle stop, but of course you could buy the Waikiki Shuttle pass as another alternative, and there is the ""pink"" $2 shuttle). But the bus stop was convenient for my treks to the Art Museum and the Iolani Palace, though at non-rush hour times, you may wait 10-15 minutes for a bus. You can also buy bus passes at the ABC and 7-11 stores. For anyone with an interest in shopping, this hotel can't be beat, as the Ala Moana shopping center has it all; don't miss the Japanese department store, Shirokiya, right outside of Macy's, which has lovely gift items (some with Japanese Cute, though the smart phone covers were the best I've seen anywhere) and a terrific bakery for those breakfast and sweets items!

Seven years later, in 2013, it's just as good for a two-nighter business trip.Can’t beat the location for me ---- yes, it’s not a beach hotel, but it’s well linked to both Waikiki and downtown Honolulu by bus routes. The Ala Moana beach is a relatively short walk away (10 minutes or less). And it’s actually linked to the Ala Moana shopping center by a pedestrian bridge, making it super-convenient to go shopping, eat at the food court or other restaurants (there’s even a Jollibee outlet for home-sick Filipinos), or dash off to buy last-minute provisions. One warning --- the short bus ride to Waikiki beach was lengthened considerably by traffic jams at 4 pm, tempting me to try walking the rest of the way. Hailing a taxi for the airport was fast and convenient too. I expected the hotel to show much wear and tear in 2013 compared to 2006 (when we were one of the first to try their newly renovated rooms). Surprisingly, the rooms still look fresh and new, not at all “tired” or slightly scruffy. The blue-green-gray aquatic décor was pleasant and very soothing. (Surprised to see that Ala Moana still uses those old-fashioned floral bed covers that most other hotels have junked long ago --- but in this case, the covers look cool and tasteful rather than chintzy.)I stayed in a 9th floor room in the Kona Tower (really just a wing attached to the high-rise main tower) which was a bit on the small side but very well organized, with a comfy queen size bed, a good-sized writing desk/dresser, a couch (yes, an actual sofa) positioned by the window, a relaxing armchair in one corner, and a very useful cupboard supply area that includes a microwave oven, a big-enough fridge (with no mini-bar items inside, thank goodness!), a coffee brewer (with free Kona coffee on hand) and lots of cabinets to store food and other stuff. I give the Ala Moana a happy “5” rating in the area of storage space ---- by the bed, in the desk, beside the closets and in the cupboard area ---- perfect for a long-staying guest.One big warning ---- there’s no room service. I had to go down to buy some plastic spoons at one of the convenience/souvenir stores just off the lobby for my nighttime snack, but then at worst there’s always Ala Moana Center right beside the hotel. (But stock up for midnight snacks, for those insomniac business travellers out there.) I wish I was informed about this upon check-in. Then again, there’s a pizza delivery ad displayed in the room (didn’t get to try it though).Notable items:--- Good view of the sea, the Ala Moana beach park and the mall rooftop, even from the 9th floor.--- Room is bright --- great lighting all around. Congratulations. However, you have to switch the lights on or off individually, no master controls.--- Pillows were small and insufficiently supportive, just serviceable.--- The flat screen TV is bigger now (in 2006 it was a small affair attached to the wall), and channel selection is OK, but I found the remote control a bit clunky.--- Internet was free --- and fast.--- Too many signs and placards lying around on the desk and tables ---- typical for a U.S. hotel. (But then with so many cabinets, it’s easy to hide them.)--- Ala Moana still uses those atrocious hangars (the ones that are actually attached to the closet rod, very impractical).--- Don’t expect a robe or slippers or free bottled water. (The tap water must be potable.) When I needed more towels or amenities, the housekeeping staff was eager and willing to provide them.--- The bathroom is OK overall. I like the curving shower curtain rod (there’s a combined tub and shower) giving you more elbow room, but the shower control is hard to figure out. There seemed to be only one direction, which gave me cold water until it suddenly switched to hot (and wasn’t that consistent overall). --- If you have two or more big suitcases, it would be hard to fit them into the room. I understand that rooms in the main tower are bigger? (My family stayed in the main tower in 2006, but I recall the room was the same size, though we were much higher up and the view was breathtaking.)--- You only get one phone, positioned on the desk. No second phone beside the bed.--- The staff was uniformly friendly and warm throughout my stay --- front desk, concierge, security, managers.--- Didn’t try the hotel’s restaurants, so can’t comment on them.One difference between Kona Tower vs. main tower: The Kona rooms have no balconies, while the main tower rooms have small glass-walled balconies that allow you to enjoy the superior views.If you’re staying until early evening to catch a midnight flight back to Asia, the hotel charges a full additional one-night rate, not even a half-day rate. (Ala Moana was willing to allow a 2-hour late check out privilege for no fee, though.) That was disappointing, but at least it was explained properly and professionally to me.All in all, a solid “4” rating for a solid hotel experience. Won’t mind bringing back the family for another holiday stay at the Ala Moana (got to get a bigger room, though).","Manila, Philippines","wingdaddy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",72,4.0

To get to a beach you must walk 2-3 blocks. This is a large modern hotel with all the amenities, though frankly I think it's petty that they only give you one packet of coffee (no choice between regular or decaf) and charge you if you want more. Must be a theft problem, but it's annoying. I was also surprised that no one (no one) at reception smiled at anyone during the 15 minutes I had to wait to register--long by my standards. The wait on elevators can be very annoying when there are crowds--they don't all seem to operate at the same time.Otherwise, a great hotel.

The hotel was featured as offering a special ""Kamaaina"" (local resident) room rate especially for the jazz festival. The rate was about $167/night.We called the morning of check in, and asked if we could check in a little earlier, because the jazz festival doors opened at 3 p.m., and check in at the hotel was also 3 p.m. We were told no, even after explaining that the whole reason we booked at the hotel was because of the hotel's promotion for the jazz festival. That was strike #1.We asked the front desk person about parking options for Kamaaiana's, and whether Ala Moana shopping center was an option. Instead of simply and politely saying no option at the shopping center, she rudely replied the hotel parking is $20 and ""I don't know anything about parking at the shopping center, call them.""

So anything other than that should be a move in the right direction. However, right away I realized that Honolulu was not going to be the same as traveling to somewhere in the continental US and I better readjust my expectations. Everyone moves a little slower, so check-in was not super speedy - not like your typical business oriented Marriott. They even used the old school credit card machines that make an imprint with the carbon paper. On my way to the room I noticed a nice series of shops, which I found later to be quite pleasant with no high pressure sales, just lots of smiles and “good vibes”. My room was tiny with a view of a roof a parking lot and some mountains way behind them - but for $125 a night, I didn't think I should complain. The bed was quite comfortable, the a/c worked well and I appreciated the fridge, microwave and coffee pot even if the space was cramped. The tv seemed possessed by gremlins and only worked intermittently – but I didn’t come to Hawaii to watch the boob-tube, right? Breakfast was served at the Plantation restaurant with a 20% discount for the guests. Excellent fruit choices, plenty of juices to choose from and the service was really pleasant, but again, they operate on a non-continental time scale. I also had dinner at the Japanese restaurant off the hotel lounge. Excellent food, dubious service – we were a large group, but the restaurant was not filled to capacity, but they did run out of menus and servers - despite that it was a great meal at an affordable price – I feel bad to complain that they weren’t faster – I didn’t have anything to go to afterwards, so why complain? The gym was nice, close to the pool and the hotel was not far from a series of public beaches. I did not get to spend much time at the beach and although they were nice and visited by a lot of people, I am sure there are much nicer beaches to be found on the island. Overall I had a nice stay, the hotel is within easy walking distance to the convention center, shopping and the beach – what more could you want on a business trip?","Charlestown, Maryland","Geoffrey D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlestown, Maryland</strong>",53,4.0

A bit pricey with not much to offer other than a skywalk to the shopping center or the beautiful view which is reason it's pricey! Pool is too small for big hotel, no real design to it, pool security rude. I invited my young nieces to swim an after using a floater for an hour as well as other Japanese guest, we were told not to use it, yet they sell these floaters in the Lamont's store on the first floor.. Maybe they shouldn't sell them downstairs, but I thought the pool guy could've been a little more pleasant!! The massage downstairs is anything but that. I made an appointment thinking its a spa environment only to find out its just your everyday home type massage with a fancy advertisement! Not what I expected I cancel my appointment, they tried to tell me there is a 24 hrs cancellation policy which they never told me, being it was only a matter of 30mins from the time of reservation and cancellation, the therapist was late, and yet they want me to pay for their time (not sure time the therapist showed up, we left) but not for the waste of my time waiting, then they planned to charge my hotel room but left a sneaky message that the room was charged even without the massage, either way, I settled with the owner, yet only to find out from her receptionist it was never charged liked they said. The owner was workable and understanding and my daughter and I got a massage to avoid charges and no service! I wouldn't recommend it, big disappointment if your used to spa massages. The rooms are small for the price I paid, my friend got a cheaper hotel in Waikiki next to the international market place and shoppings, exec, for a $100 cheaper and yet they're room was bigger and nicer with everything right outside there hotel door.My room did not have a microwave that I discovered after buying frozen pizza that's its a toaster type warmer that looks like a microwave! Disappointed... For paying the big bucks for the Waikiki towers.. You would need to go to the cheaper towers to do laundry, inconvenience!! I stayed at the Ala Moana in my past trips and they used to have a laundromat but I guess they phased it out same as room service!!! So if you get hungry late at night, lol they have a pamphlet that suggest pizza delivery no later than 1am! No courtesy envelopes, stationary, pens. Well although I made it a pleasant and it was okay, the lobby is nice and very spacious, it's best features.., I would suggest finding a cheaper hotel in Waikiki with the beaches, stores, activities, etc. within walking distance from everything instead of paying parking space irregardless if your a guest at the hotel! so unless you just want to mall shop for most of your trip the Ala Moana is the place for you! For seniors the discounts only apply to the Kona towers the one with no balcony, guess they're worried the seniors will fall off them! Either you give seniors a discount or not, leave the option open for them to choose which tower!","Guam, Mariana Islands","B B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guam, Mariana Islands</strong>",1,4.0

The hotel was clean and nicely appointed. This is not a luxury setting, with thick, cushy towels. The towels do the job with no problem, but are what you might find at home. There is a nice Chinese restaurant in the hotel, where we had lunch not once but twice. There is also a Japanese bar like restaurant toward the back and a standard Western coffee shop. We asked to stay in the Waikiki tower, which we heard is more recently renovated. Very nice, quiet for the most part and a keyed elevator for guests.

It is true that it takes only one bad thing to ruin your entire perception of something, and only one bad employee can bring down a hotel's reputation. First of all, let me say that we were very happy with our room, everything was clean, bed was comfortable, we had a great view of the mountains on the 35th floor. It was adjacent to the Ala Moana Mall which was convenient, and away from the touristy chaos of Waikiki. I was ready to write a glowing review and had plans to come back for more. The one bad thing that happened was at the hotel restaurant for breakfast buffet, the Plantation Cafe. We used the buffet only twice during our stay because we had to be out early sometimes and had no time for breakfast. The food was the usual served for breakfast with hot and cold choices, fruits, bread. The first time we used it was ok, but the second time we ate there, a dishonest employee tampered with my credit card receipt to add his/her tip and changed the total. This is criminal. Let me say that I often tip in cash because I believe our server should be the one to get it, I seldom add the tip to the credit card total. So the reason I caught this was because I always check my purchases online to see my statements and compare with my receipts (I know, OC, I was a victim of identity theft before and am more careful now), and there it was, they added to the tip/gratuity and added up the new total. It was a small amount, $7, 20% of the total plus tax (but really this was a buffet and not sit-down) but the point is they tampered, and I already tipped in cash. There was only 2 of us who ate at $16/pax. Again I go back to the point, they tampered with the receipt! Ala Moana is a nice hotel. It's a pity that this happened. They have dishonest people.

With a great sauna+steam room and good fitness center and a sunny pool, I was on the 4th floor (Kona/mountain view room) so just down the hall from all those amenities. At a senior rate of only $129 a night, it was a bargain for Hawaii prices so I was pleasantly surprised to find the room so nicely appointed and furnished (as a single person the room size was fine and I preferred not having a balcony). No annoying mini-bar but instead a nice sized fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, room safe, iron and ironing board, etc. The room was always cleaned and serviced very well and there was never any noise problems from the hall or other rooms. AC was noiseless and easily controlled at the thermostat.I was walking or riding with relatives so the parking wasn't an issue for me and the local bus service is plentiful and cheap (can get a 4 day unlimited pass for $25) and easily accessed from here. Front desk and bell staff were very helpful (at check-out they printed out my boarding passes for my flight for me since they don't have free computers/printers to use yourself).

Locals stayed there, we played there, ate there, listened to local entertainment, hung out at Nicolas upstairs and went to Rumors on occasions. But I dont think that the hotel has been doing too well of late. It has become a dumping ground for the airlines to keep its staff for over nighters. The lobby no longer has ANY life to it, zero! The beds still have the same bedspread from the 70s it had before. Colorful but UGLY, scared to even sit on them not knowing if they have ever been washed. My pet peeve is always coffee. Why even bother if you cant even get it half right? The put the coffee pot under a shelf that prevents you from opening the top of it, so you have to pull it out but there is no where to put it! Dumb!!! Lions coffee is undrinkable and powered cream with only three sugar packs in the room? Not enough to hide the bitterness of this cheap garbage. No drinking water in the room, ahhhh but there is a refrigerator! Too bad I had to unplug it because I couldn't sleep over the noise it made....The staff reflects this hotels personality, boring, been here too long and don't care if you like it or not. View of the Ala Moana shopping center was all I could see, even though I was told that it had a partial ocean view. I made a point of asking them for nice view. Considering that the hotel was pretty much empty, I would say that there was no effort made to accommodate this request!

This is what i was looking for . Yes, if you are fine with $$$$ , you can find better place in front of beach. I like to rent car , go around town, explore the area, so being in front of beach to walk out in shorts from my room was not my priority on this trip. Depends on what you are looking for, this is at edge of Waikiki beach area and right at the shopping complex. Waikiki beach area is walk able from here or couple of bus stops if you don't like to move. Although Waikiki is a perfect combination of nice-hotel + beach + shopping, this is not such a great beach (if i compare with Caribbean hotels or other Honolulu beaches). There are really beautiful beaches around Honolulu and i would spend my time out there instead of Waikiki beach. If you are beach lover like me, plan on spending whole day at each of other other beaches. I stayed at the second tower, its bit older, but was well renovated. The room was clean, nicely decorated, it does not feel new / shiny , but was NOT leaking or broken/bad. There is a dance floor/club right here if you are into it, but I wasn't thrilled to go dancing at Honolulu, either due to crowd or bad season, it did not have fun vibes. I hated to pay for parking - $20/day, which i'm not used to, but it seems the norm in Honolulu. You CAN find free overnight parking around this area, i rented a convertible, so I chose the paid parking and sleep peacefully :), besides it is very convenient if you are in and out during day. The breakfast at cafe downstairs is good, or if you are an explorer like me, there are other places near by in Waikiki area for similar price, but you need a car / bike or walk to Waikiki beach early morning and have breakfast.

We were happy to leave our bags in storage and go exploring. Reception had only one person on duty at 11am so it was slow checking in but she was very helpful and friendly. The person who was on duty when we returned for our key that afternoon was less so and while she was efficient, she was not at all friendly and didn't smile once.Location : excellent with a connecting bridge to the huge Ala Moana shopping centre next door. We were there 4 days but didn't see half of the shopping centre I suspect.The room: large, very clean, with an iron and ironing board. Appeared to have been renovated in the last couple of years. Pleasant décor with a balcony, small table and 2 chairs with views of the marina and ocean to the left of a building and the ocean park to the right of the same building. A pity about the tall building splitting the view, but it was nevertheless gorgeous sitting on the balcony watching the ocean.There was a fridge in the room, but no mini bar which didn't bother us at all. What was very odd though was that the room had a small microwave oven but not so much as a spoon in the room to stir a cup of coffee, let alone plates and utensils to use with the oven. There was a small coffee maker with 2 large white mugs and a packet of coffee. There was also an ice machine on each floor which suited us fine. There was also a soft drink vending machine next to the ice machine on each floor selling Pepsi products. So if you are a Coke drinker, get it outside the hotel. There was no room service in the hotel that I could discern from the hotel services directory in the room. Again this didn't really bother us.The bed: very comfortable, as were the pillows.Bathroom: small but functional and very clean. Forget about using the hair dryer though if you have long or thick hair. It was hopeless. If you are coming from a country which uses different electric current, either take a hair dryer that has a dual current or buy one locally.Pool: sparkling clean but the surrounds weren't anything to write home about. It wasn't a very inviting environment and the pebblecrete was disintegrating underfoot to the extent that it was impossible to walk on it barefoot without considerable pain. A proper sweep is in order to remove the myriad of loose pebblecrete all over the ground. The pool area would also have benefited from some shade - either trees or umbrellas. There was a pool attendant and the pool also had a device to lower disabled people into the water. While we were there maintenance staff came to check it was in working order. Aircon: being an older hotel, the aircon unit was in the room. It was a little noisy, but not so much that it interrupted our sleep or detracted from our overall visit.Checkout: efficient, but again, not friendly. The receptionist didn't even bother to ask if we had enjoyed our stay.","Canberra, Australia","Therese L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",119,4.0

You can reserve a room directly through Outrigger or through a private owner and we have done both. The gym is immaculate and more than adequate and never crowded. The same goes with the pool. The rooms are also immaculate and very comfortable. Bathrooms are generously sized and well lighted which is great for beauty junkies like me.

It has the greatest density of population, on a rather small space. This hotel is attached to the shopping center of the same name. I am aware of women coming here to shop at the holiday season, since there are stores in the mall not found on the other islands. Staying next door is a great convenience.The room is small. There is a coffee maker, small refridge, and microwave. Nice slate floor when you come in which continues into the bath. Large mirror just off the bath, across from the kitchen area. Not sure if that would be useful since you can't get much distance from the mirror.Supposedly the love seat is a sleeper-sofa. Didn't need it, so I have no idea if it is comfy. If that is used, there is absolutely no room between the rest of the room and the sliding door to the outside world. There's no lanai to exit to via this sliding door. Just a city/mountain view (see attached photo). Which also means sunrise into your room. FYI - there is no screen on the slider. One of the nice things about Hawaii is the minimal bugs we have here. The bathroom had a white with gray streak marble counter top. Unfortunate choice, because the finish has gotten destroyed in a few places by lotions and other fluids spilled on it. The nickel finish handles of the tap are uncomfortable and do not seem to turn on / off in the usual manner. The faucet dripped significantly. Reported that when I checked out. The check out time is not noted on the back of the door (noon). Small pillows on the bed. Another pillow option is tucked in the closet. Issues - the artwork in the room consisted of three pieces. The glass covering the Nautilus shell image had dots of some sort of dried fluid on it. The largest piece had a nice hand print on it. The corner of one of the cushions on the loveseat was torn and there were coffee (?) stains on the bottom of the sofa. The desk had a glass cover but the finish on the wood under it was water damaged. The very large TV had a connectivity problem with the cable, which was easily fixed by twisting the coax connection a little tighter. The main bank of six elevators did not go to the floor my room was on. There was a bit of a stroll to get around to the three which accessed the floor. Was this a good value - close to $200 for this room? Doesn't feel like it.

We have just a short flight to/from Honolulu from Maui, but decided to stay the night for fun (nightmare). The proximity to the mall was convenient. The ""upgraded room"" was what I would consider a very typical standard room at most hotels. I will say the view was VERY nice. The bad news....we got into bed at around 11:00 PM and when I looked behind me, there was a bed bug on the wall next to the headboard!!! Ewww....We called the front desk, they apologized, had security come up, verify if was a bed bug, take an incident report, move us and put us into a standard crammed room as that is what was available because of a busy weekend. Couldn't get that bug crawling on me feeling to go away and couldn't sleep after that. Worried about my items being infested, taking them home, etc. Finally, when we went to check out the next morning....the manager gave us a $30.00 discount!!!! Seriously??? I attempted to show pictures of the bug, but nobody wanted to see them when I offered (manager and staff). What kind of customer service allows you to complain about bed bugs, be inconvenienced by moving you to another room at 11:00 PM, not getting a good night's sleep and then gives you a $30.00 discount on a close to $300.00 hotel bill for ONE NIGHT? What a joke. That room should have been comped. I will NEVER EVER stay at this hotel again. All they had to do at the front desk was apologize and say ""Mrs, your stay is all taken care of"" and I most likely would not even have written this review. BUT...because of their misguided attempt at customer service, here it is. I paid for BED BUGS and a subsequent horrible night's sleep???? Seriously???? No comped room?

The hotel has two towers, so there is a bit of walking within. Also, there is pool, fitness centre, restaurants and nightclub. The rooms have been updated and are very clean.

The beach at Ala Moana Park is nice and about a 10 minute walk. Waikiki is about 20 minutes, so most of the city life is there.

The hotel also does not have room service or a (decent) restaurant (they do have a restaurant that caters to the Japanese market and a fairly decent breakfast buffet), so getting a simple bite to eat requires a walk to the mall.

This hotel is conveniently located near the Ala Moana Shopping Center and relatively close to Waikiki Beach.

I went out there as a birthday present to myself. As I arrived at the Hotel I pulled my own bag out of the trunk of the taxi as the two Doormen watched and talked to eachother. Was never even greeted just a simple glance. I myself am A doorman/Concierge at a pristine hotel in San Francisco, CA where this would not be tolerated. Then I checked into my room which was like the size of a closet. I went back to the front desk and asked for a different room and she joked and said I booked through a third party website therefore they gave me the cheap room. (not funny).Then they charged me 29.00 per night for a room upgrade which wasnt an upgrade it was the same room only two beds which I was traveling alone and didnt need two beds. Then I walked into the chinese restaurant there and they turned me away cause they said everything was reserved. Even though it was half empty. Then to top it off I booked a shuttle back to the airport that never arrived. I asked the doorman to check if it was coming because they booked it and I wasnt aware which company they used. I paid in advance to the bellman the night before and Im guessing he pocketed my money. Then I flagged my own taxi to the airport. My vacation was a disaster because of my hotel experience.

So, you're not really staying in a hotel--you're staying in an apartment building. I began to appreciate this when I went looking for a beer one afternoon. The hotel bar is gone. Plus, I never found a place to have breakfast in the morning, apart from the mall.When I checked in, I was ""upgraded"" to a ""partial ocean view."" The view consisted of a long look over the roof of the hotel's lower level. Then, a longer view of the deck of the parking structure of the Ala Moana mall. Then, 'way in the distance, what may have been the ocean.Speaking of the mall, most of the reviewers note that the hotel is ""right next to"" the Ala Moana mall. That's really overselling it. You go down to the second floor, then walk a distance to a ramp which dumps you onto the deck of the mall parking structure, then you walk a long way to the door to Macy's (which is at one far end of the mall.)I had no problem with the front desk staff, or with the cleanliness of the hotel.

There is the main tower of the hotel, presumably more desirable, and then the back tower, accessed around the back side of the main lobby. That was where my nearly $200/night landed me. Unlike the review by Ksmui, I did not receive an upgrade. The room was small, and not recently updated at all. The lanai/patio was literally non-existent; only a railing with a sign reading, ""do not hang towels from railing"". The railing separated the room from the rooftop and the view was overlooking the Ala Moana Shopping Center parking lot. Granted, I could see the ocean, not easily but it was possible. The staff was quite competent and we received especially good service at the front desk. Readers may note that this is my first, ""less than stellar"" review.

I have stayed in Honolulu, Waikiki and Ko Olina previously for same but this was my first solo trip. The Ala Moana hotel was easy to get to from the airport with my rental car and GPS. Valet was quick; NOT AT ALL FRIENDLY, but parking prices were as expected at $25/nt. The lobby was fine, no long waits, no pushy time share sales and it did not look deserted as I had read previously. I was told on check in that if I had room key issues (I had read lots about this as well) to use the phone on each floor to have it rectified but I had no such issues. It took 3 swipes for my card to work in the elevator (every time) but was fine otherwise. Room 2607 in the Waikiki Tower was a very large corner room with a kitchen (inexplicably no utensils) a separate bedroom and 2 lanais (1 a walk out with table and chairs) overlooking the ocean and the mall below. The room was clean, I had coffee every day (I did not have to pay $1) and bathroom amenities were okay (if you use condiditioner you will need to bring it but I had read this previously and brought some). The internet was fine, I had the choice of hard-wired or wifi which was a nice surprise. The convenience store in the lobby was good for water, snacks etc. at reasonable prices. Access to the mall was easy, just across the 2nd level parking lot to Macy's. The food court was great and I brought alot of meals back to my room. I also bought my breakfast and lunch at the food court as there are no restaurants closeby where I was working. I did walk to Waikiki one night at dusk and it took about 20 minutes to get to the main strip along a fairly well lit route. I took a cab back to the hotel for less than $10. This hotel was perfect for my needs and my huge room was decently priced at $199/nt but If I was going on a family vacation I'd probably choose to stay closer to the beach.

We are not luxury hotel denizens, but we do like somewhere that goes beyond the basics, or we would stay at the YMCA. Well, the Honolulu YMCA is right across the street from the Ala Moana, and is probably just as nice. Near the registration desk the Ala Moana proudly displays its awards for ""best value"". I view this similarly to ""most improved"" or ""best attendance"" awards -- sops for the also-rans.The Ala Moana is not close to the beach, not close to Waikiki, not close to bars and (non-mall) restaurants, and not that close to pretty much anything except a giant shopping mall that separates it from the ocean, a liquor store, and a couple of strip bars. So the location (for anyone except mall-dwellers) is mediocre at best.Add to this that the hotel has no bar, an extremely basic pool area (too cold and windswept to use during our visit), and one of the worst hotel restaurants I've ever been to, and you have ... ""thanks for participating"". The breakfast restaurant (not open for lunch) serves a fruit-and-steam-tray buffet for $20 -- that's it. If you want a smoothie, a fried egg, or something else, you're out of luck.Our room was clean, and we did not have trouble with rude staff in the way others have reported. The equipment worked, though the WiFi was somewhat iffy and gave my laptop a nasty virus. The rooms each have a minuscule balcony/lanai, but most of them are going to overlook either the shopping mall or the YMCA -- very few views of the ocean are available. And you won't want to leave the door open for the tropical air, because the hotel is on some sort of police/fire/ambulance route, and there were sirens blaring more or less constantly.I didn't come to Honolulu thinking of staying in a concrete-lined urban hellscape, but you'll need to traverse a mammoth multi-level parking lot and cross several major roads at busy intersections and walk extensively to get a sight of the beach and the sea. The Ala Moana seems very popular with Japanese tourists who don't seem to mind flying all the way to Hawaii to shop in the mall at the same stores you'll find in Tokyo.For me, Hawaii is not about being the ""best value"".

There is a walkway/bridge that allows you to walk to the ala moana mall from the second floor of the hotel. We found this especially convenient. We often just grabbed a bento box from Shirokiya for lunch, or something from the grocery store-Food land, which is also in the mall.  Another tip-for inexpensive souvenirs is Walmart, which is within walking distance of the hotel, and Longs Drugs (inside the mall).  I have no complaints about the hotel.

The hotel is large and modern. Rooms are average size and have a refrigerator, microwave, and in room coffee maker. It was very quiet and pleasant. I enjoyed an amazing in-room massage because I had a terrible migraine. The massage therapists are also available in their spa downstairs. The pool is nothing remarkable, but satisfactory. We were not there to hang out by the pool in any case. There is a fitness center and sauna(I didn't personally use) but I saw several guests using it. What I found convenient for our early morning tour departures was the sundry shop in the lobby which was very well stocked and not too pricey as one might expect for a hotel store. I was able to get fresh cut up fruit, milk, cereal, granola bars, snacks etc. our tours would sometimes leave before the hotel restaurant was open, so it was a real life saver. There is a dunkin doughnuts across the street for coffee if you like. The hotel also has several restaurants on property. The hotel is very large, we honestly didn't see it all. It is right next door to the world's largest outdoor shopping mall Ala Moana center. You can see the ocean from most rooms. The hotel is not on the beach, but very close if you want to go. We are from Miami Beach, so honestly, laying on the beach was not a priority. We wanted to see more historically significant sites and unique areas like volcanoes and black sand beaches... It is a short walk to the Waikiki area which is nice, but a lot of traffic and noise. Reminds me a bit of south beach. What I liked about the location of Ala Moana was that is was more of a local neighborhood, not too touristy. We were in walking distance of some really nice local restaurants where we were the only tourists. I recommend staying here if you are low key type of person or family and like to be near everything, but not necessarily right in the thick of it. It is not the Ritz Carlton, more like a Marriott. One more local tip I was given, if you want to buy souvenirs and coffee, nuts, etc. to take back you have to go to Don Quixote. It would be a cross between a Costco and Target shop.

There isn't much that is cheap in Honolulu, but this is a nice compromise. My Kona Tower, mountain view room on the 12th floor came with a microwave, quiet fridge, lots of storage space and a room safe. Strangely no utensils or plates. The location is great, about a 12 minute walk to the edge of Wakiki beach or Ala Moana Beach Park. The mall that is located right next door has a grocery store and a great food fair. The hotel also has a pool and a store. The pool water is very cold, it closes at 6:30 (sunset) and I couldn't find a pool bar. As I was travelling alone I was hoping that the pool would fill my evenings, so this was a disappointment. I still found ways to enjoy the evening though. The sauna doesn't have a shower, you will have to shower in your room and decide to dry off and redress or to drip water all the way down to it. The concierge is actually a 'expeidia local expert' there was one there for the first week and then a different one each day after that. The first one was very reluctant to provide any free advice on local sites or transportation. She was wrong about bus stops and couldn't give a number for the city bus even though it turned out to be on the maps she was handing out. The Ala Moana mall, next door, is a major city bus transportation point. You can get on a bus there to go into town, or around the island. This was very convienient. Mostly I walked to the sites along Wakiki as it was easy to find interesting shops, restruants and such. The Hilton is near by where there is an awesome free firework show on Friday evenings. I was pleased with the Ala Moana Hotel's policy on towels and sheets (the guest chooses whether they want new ones or not) and I was glad to see no plastic bags in the garbage cans (yes they were clean, I put food waste in them yet each day they were cleaned).Here comes the shame-shame: Ala Moana Hotel - you hotels need to take up the torch on recyling. Why no containers to put empty bottles in? Why no bento boxes made of compostable materials? Why no seperate containers for greens? Us tourists will leave a lot of garbage behind for Hawaii to try and bury, it's time to make this harder for us to do.","New Westminster, Canada","Ginger I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Westminster, Canada</strong>",65,4.0

This is where most of the airline staff stays during layovers.The lobby feels like a convention hotel, large with a lot of separate seating/congregating areas. For the size of the hotel though, the check-in area is way too small. I got lucky and check-in during a lull in the action. Over the next 3 days, I saw an hour plus line during check-in. The worst part of the hotel though was the bell/valet staff. This is why I can't recommend the hotel. On 3 separate occasions, I walked by the bell/valet staff complaining to each other about work and using some nice, colorful language. If this is the way the staff thinks they can act in front of customers, I can only imagine what else gets past the management staff. The rooms are small but comfortable. The bath amenities are pretty basic (cheap shampoo, lotion, and soap only). There were some stains on the chairs. I don't understand how housekeeping can't figure out a way to remove these stained items, replace them with some reserve stock then replace the original after it is cleaned. There is nothing worse than seeing stains on chairs/ sofas in a hotel room. For business, the hotel's Internet is pretty fast and reliable. It's location is also much more convenient than most of the other Kalakaua and Kuhio hotels.

So we went to the shopping center to have something to eat and when we came back we were finally able to check in and found out several of the other passengers from the same flight had been able to check in earlier. Apparently Andrew just did not feel like doing it for us. So the first night we were put in a room the size of a postal stamp, so small we were bumping into each other, mildew in the bathtub, and a very old, ratty looking comforter on the bed, they really need to throw those away and upgrade the rooms.

I appreciate the ability to shop and then deposit my shopping bags into my hotel room rather than leave them in a car which can be robbed.. That is THE selling point. The employees are, by and large, very courteous and helpful; however, the rooms leave something to be desired. The hotel could be upgraded but is basically a condo hotel. Actually, the thing that drives me absolutely nuts when I stay at this hotel is the hotel card key. It is of horrible quality. You need to use your card key to get to your floor in the elevator. You also need your card key to get into your hotel room.

Additionally the hotel has major staffing issues- the front desk was often unable to answer calls (as I tried to get help on smokers and roaches) because they were so poorly staffed. It took us 35 minutes to get checked in. The third day I finally complained. The guest services manager was professional and nice but overworked, he offered a number of perks, such as free valet and breakfast. The next day I went to use the valet- but was informed I would need a special slip from the front desk and it looked to be a 30 minute wait. Comical and ridiculous. So I saw the manager that evening and said I would after all take him up on the breakfast, as I had declined it previously (pregnant wife, first kid, trying to be healthier) He had to check his log to remember what my issues were. Amazing because that would mean he'd had so many complaints he couldn't recall mine, which to me seemed egregious and remarkable. He said he could cover one breakfast but not another for my inlaws (he relented after I reminded him about the cockroach which appearently didn't warrant a note in the log)The manner with which he disregarded the Ritalin in the hallway (a schedule 2 drug) makes me suspect drugs aren't uncommon- I won't even start with the seedy characters attending the hotel's night club, 'Rumors'.Shady and gross, spend the extra 40$ a night and save yourself the icky feelings.","San Francisco, California","IkeSmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,1.0

When we checked in, we took the option given to us of paying an extra $20 (+tax) per night for an upgrade to a 30th floor balcony room in the Waikki tower of the Ala Moana hotel. The view of the mountains was great, the lobby large and spacious, and the Ala Moana shopping centre only a five minute walk away. However, the constant noise of sirens (day and night) made it difficult to relax and our sleep was often interrupted. The 'cold' water in the hand basin was constantly warm to hot. The temperature of the shower water could not be adjusted. We often had to endure very hot or cold showers, with the temperature changing at will from one extreme to the next. TV reception was grainy and the remote control difficult to use. Free Internet in the room was great, but we experienced several long periods where it cut out. When we arrived the toilet was not flushing properly and my husband noticed that a pipe in the cistern was not connected. Meanwhile, the room was tiny, with the king size bed pretty much occupying the entire room. A queen size bed would have been a better fit, but we were told that all rooms come with either a king size bed or two doubles. There was no mirror in the room and the two chairs had stains on them.On day three we went to the reception desk and advised them of the plumbing issues. We were told that we did not know how to use the shower and that someone would come to assist us, but no one ever came. When checking out we raised the matter again and the same reception person said she had booked a manager to see us. She asked if we would like to review the matter at that time with a manager but we made it clear that at checkout this no long pager mattered.The large lobby had a stage but there was never any music even though it was the Christmas period. The noise from the night club was loud and univiting, and there were no Christmas activities or dinners at this hotel apart from a few Christmas trees. It was like a vacant parking lot in need of care and attention.Despite the great view, we will never return to this hotel. The so called upgrade was a mockery as the room was noisy, had poor plumbing, was very small, and had poor television reception and interruption to the Internet.","Greater London, United Kingdom","Trip101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater London, United Kingdom</strong>",77,3.0

From the hotel, it’s just a few minutes walk to Waikiki itself (just across the canal) and maybe 10 minutes to get well “into” the Waikiki shopping area. We chose the Ala Moana, frankly, for its location and the fact that it provides clean, modern accommodations with things we wanted (free wifi, in-room microwave and fridge, and other nice touches) without costing the full Waikiki freight. Also, a great plus in my view, there were no mandatory “resort fees” and other irritating grabs of the sort that we’d experienced or heard about in some of the Waikiki hotels.

The hotel was well maintained, our rooms were beautiful. I had a king size bed and the parents had beds with two queens. The rooms are not huge but still a decent size for Honolulu.

We had airplane vouchers but the expense was still reasonable at about $16 each for adults. Waiter kept the coffee going.It really is a beautiful hotel in a section more reserved for adults. If you want the excitement of Waikiki there are buses going down there or you can arrange excursions with the concierge in the hotel. The only reason I can think of for the other lukewarm reviews is that came before or during renovations because what I saw was a very classy hotel. No, it may not be the Ritz and it has a more Zen feel, but I liked that. Maybe because in Waikiki I was stuck at Aston Beach Circle hotel which was small and well, not much to be said about it except location was good for Waikiki.I didn't think the size was any smaller than other hotel room in the area that wasn't a suite.So if you like being away from Waikiki just a bit, still a good walk or quick bus ride, then this was a nice alternative.",Del Valle,"familytraveler36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Del Valle</strong>",15,5.0

Front desk staff was incredibly prompt and friendly-- particularly given the swarm of disgruntled flight passengers crowding the lobby. My room was clean and comfortable, but basic and dated. In fact, the hallway was some sort of 80s hell with Saved By The Bell meets The Shining carpeting, but that's neither here nor there. The best feature of the room? A nice balcony that opened up to downtown Waikiki, which was lovely to watch twinkle in the night sky. The downside of the balcony? Apparently Snoop Dogg was staying near me, given the amount of pot smoke that came billowing in the moment I opened my balcony door (this, of course, isn't the hotel's fault). The free breakfast we got from the airline, down at the Ala Moana's restaurant was. . . well, it was freaking terrible. I know I shouldn't be complaining about anything that was free, but I had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated, the food was cold and dry, and the wait staff was about as grumpy as anybody could be. Blech.When I say I wouldn't stay here, that's because I'm a bit of a travel snob-- Waikiki isn't my thing, nor are most super busy touristy areas. I stayed over at a rented house in Waimanalo, so I can't imagine choosing to stay someplace like the Ala Moana in the metropolitan part of the island.

Acceptable at most levels, not exceptional in any level I can think of. Rooms are dated, but have mini fridges that are not common to some higher rated hotels. Bedsheets are clean but the bedspreads are old, ratty and ugly. I always strip the bedspread off and use an extra blanket. They have upgraded the TVs to flatscreen HDTVs which are nice, but the remote controls seem to have difficulties communicating with the TVs. Wireless internet is free which is nice. Each room has a ""Lanai"" with two chairs and a small table, which are fun to hang out on but can be pretty noisy.Rooms with the best views are of the harbor, and other high rises lining Waikiki facing east. However all rooms can be pretty noisy with traffic noise, especially from sirens and loud Harley Motorcycles echoing through the concrete canyons.The Ala Moana Mall is adjacent to the hotel which is great for shopping and choices of restaurants and bars. Anchor stores include Macy's, Sears and Neiman Marcus, plus a huge Apple store, Old Navy, ABC store, supermarket, and a huge food court. There are numerous super high end retailers that cater to the Japanese tourists too. Upper floor of the mall has a great selection of restaurants and bars, with a pretty good night life vibe. A Mai Tai bar is centrally located with an open air setting and live entertainment.On the other side of the hotel is the convention center, and many conventioneers tend to stay at this hotel. There is also a small ""red light district"" adjacent as well that has strip bars and massage parlors, but I personally have never felt threatened, but I don't typically walk around late at night.The Ala Moana has a breakfast buffet, a Chinese and a Japanese restaurant, a night club (Rumours), an ABC type convenience store and some souvenir shops. I have only been to the convenience store so I cannot comment on the other venues. The pool area is an enigma. They have laid down a very rough (and very painful for bare feet) gravel surface to the pool area. Also, the pool itself is very cold, which is odd considering how it sets out in the Hawaiian heat each day. If you bring any alcohol to the pool you will be asked to leave. This is a bizarre rule considering how almost every other hotel in Waikiki has an actual bar AT the pool!To summarize, the hotel is acceptable and is close to great shopping and restaurants. This is NOT a hotel I would choose if I were on a beach centered vacation. It is a pretty long walk to the beach. The hotel is fine for a business related stay.","Agoura Hills, California","FuguFish</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Agoura Hills, California</strong>",8,3.0

We first arrived to discover that they had booked a room with two beds instead of a big king. The front desk happily moved us in to a new room on the spot at no charge. We also got a gorgeous view of the ocean and Ala Moana Beach Park (from the 27th floor)! It was amazing to sit out on the balcony to watch the sunset in the evenings and to relax outside in the calm mornings. On-site self-parking was provided for about $20/day. The lots tends to get full but they had staff on hand to help you out at all hours.I think the big perk of this hotel is that you can take the escalator/elevator to the 2nd floor and just walk across the sky bridge to Ala Moana Center.

My partner and I do not like to stay in resorts or family orientated accommodation when we go on holiday because we do not like children. We feel that there is nothing worse on a holiday that having to contend with children in our hotel.Our priority in Hawaii asise from the vow-renewal was shopping, site-seeing and more shopping and this is exactly what we accomplished.The Ala Moana provided a perfect base for us. The hotel is located next to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and has a foot-bridge from the hotel that connects to the Macy's Carpark - so access to the shopping centre was easy.The hotel was clean, the staff were polite, accommodating and helpful (not that we needed much help).I would strongly suggest staying at the Ala Moana Hotel if you were either travelling solo or with someone else and not wanting to have to worry about children.As I mentioned, the hotel is a corporate hotel, so there is 1 restaurant for dinner, an Asian style restaurant which we didn't utilize becuase we wanted to try the numerous restaurants in Waikiki or the restaurants at the Shopping Centre. There is a breakfast only restaurant which is convenienent if you want to stay at the hotel, but again, we didn't use this either.We stayed the the Kona Tower of the hotel under recommendation by other reviewers on Trip Advisor and by our Travel Agent. We booked a partial ocean view room, but when I opened the curtain, I could see the ocean quite clearly. Yes, we overlooked the Macy's Carpark, but the ocean was in clear view.The only thing that I thought that could be changed/added is they have tea/coffee making facilites, but no teaspoons to stir your tea/coffee and dessert spoons should be added to the room because the gift shop sells pints of ice-cream, but with no spoons - that is a bit difficult to eat.I did enquire at reception about spoons to use, but they explained that don't have any mental spoons but could offer me a plastic spoon. I felt that since I wanted to eat ice-cream, plastic spoons would not be the best option at the hard ice-cream would break it.If you are looking to book accommodation in Hawaii - the Ala Moana Hotel is just outside of Waikiki, approx 1.5kms, so if you are wanting to stay right in the heart of it, this hotel might not be for you. Everytime we wanted to go into Waikiki, we took a trolly that left from the shopping centre and it only cost US$2 per person each way and that was about a 10/15 minute trip into Waikiki or if you are feeling energetic, you could walk.","Gold Coast, Australia","Pradaboy84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",8,5.0

Then, she asked me if I would like two double beds instead and I said no. Later, she told me if I could wait for about 15 minutes and we'll have a room. I assumed after 15 more minutes it would be a Queen size bed which we reserved so I agreed. We we entered the room, there was no Queen size bed. If time was needed for a Queen size bed, the receptionist could have told me and I would have gone shopping and returned later. The receptionist quietly worked the computer over a prolonged period and fail to sense the customer's need to know what is happening. There was no explanation for the delay or apology.

I was trying to stop him from leaving the elevator door because I was still inside the elevator, My sister was desperately trying to reach for her purse laying on top of the luggages. She kept on telling him ""give me my purse please, I want my purse"" her hand stretched out trying to reached for it and the attendant did not hand it to her while the elevator door kept on closing on her hand and so she sustained some bruising. In the commotion, the elevator door closed and I was not able to get out to be with our luggage. We waited at our room door on the third floor, and the attendant took quite long to reach the area. We were so worried. When he finally showed up, I asked him why he took our cart if we clearly told him we can do it ourselves. He said it is for our safety. I asked what safety? and he said we might hit our head to the cart. Sarcastically I said to him. it must be a Hawaiian procedure and he replied, yes it is. This attendant has an attitude the whole time. Very disrespectful.Inside our room, quite a disappointment, so small, carpet not so clean looking.

This is really the only reason we picked this hotel. We didnt care the rest. Bed and Toilet are decent. It served our purpose. Check-in Staff is not in a hurry to check you in. The key to my room I had didnt work for 4 times. Called security but took him a long time to come. He did apologise when i finally saw him after getting my 5th key. I didnt think it was funny to be laughed at by the check-in staff as I QUEUE each time to get new key and it took me 40 mins just to get into my room.....which is really another room because I refused to try a new key (5th time) on the original room. The lift is another problem....we had to slot our key into the lift to get to our floor. It suits us well and you would feel safe becos of the security BUT the key DOES not work all the time so you often find yourself in a lift full of people all struggling with our keys to slot into the lift just to get to our floor!

We chose the Ala Moana because it had decent reviews on TripAdvisor and reasonable rates.Since we took their lowest rate, we didn't end up with an ocean facing penthouse view - instead, we ended up in the Kona Tower (the short one) on the fourth floor. The room was small with a queen bed, but it also had a work desk, microwave, decent-sized refrigerator, and coffee maker. The room was clean, and housekeeping did a good job of keeping it that way. It did have sliding doors to the outside, but the ""balcony"" was just a barrier to keep you from falling out the door. That was fine with us as we did take their cheapest rate. (The main tower rooms had balconies with chairs and a table - but you'll pay more.) The hotel has a walkway on the second floor to the Ala Moana mall (biggest in Hawaii) if shopping is your thing, and the Ala Moana Beach Park is just a block away. Breakfast is a bit pricey at the cafe, but with a bit of snooping you can find other options.

In fact it doesn't bother me cuz it's only for sleep.1st night stayed, there is a ice maker machine (huge) at thf entrance where my room is . So noisy first night didn't sleep at all. Spoke to the manager, changed to a different room. Since we go out everyday in am not back to hotel until night time. When I ready for bed the 2nd night, I heard the same noise from the ice making machine again. I opened the door and saw the room only moved away 2 room further away from the ice machine. I called the manager that night, and explained the concen.He says he has no control of the noise for ice machine, But willing to move to another at end of hall. W finally settled in the 3rd time.I spoke to a different manage today as if I can extend the check ou time until 3pm due to some delay in flight ,rather than 12 o'clock standard time. He says he has to charge me 60+tax for the hour I stay( 12- 5pm). I say to him I only need until 4pm and its not fair to charge this amount if u only stay for 4 more hours. His explaintion is that each room in ala moana hotel is ownedBy individual owner, if you don't move out 1pm the room won't eSold and the hotel will have to pay .The reason I got mad/upset is that he keeps saying this Hotel is different from others is that it's owned by private owner and he has to sell the room or else the hotel will pay to the owner. I understand it's a business but he just charging expensive amount from the customer and not even cares my basic needs.anyway, I have to agree from previous reviewer, this is not what you wana hen you choos s hotel.

I fell into the latter category. The Ala Moana Hotel is fine for a conference hotel, no complaints about anything, but nothing special. Very average. You can check out towels by the pool to take the beach (about a 10 minute walk). We stayed in the Waikiki Tower and had a microwave, coffee maker and good size mini-fridge that was empty (not filled with overpriced snacks and booze). The hotel is adjacent to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and it is easy to stop by the grocery store or food court for breakfast, lunch or snack items. Bring some plastic cutlery from home. It is also easy to catch the bus to just about anywhere you want to go. The bus website (www.thebus.org) is great as it gives you the stop number to let you know you are waiting at the right place! $2.50 for adult or get a 4-day pass for $25. Warning – the buses can get pretty full. We took the bus to Pearl Harbor (a must see), Waikiki and Diamond Head Crater. On Wednesdays from 4-7pm is a farmer’s market at the Blaisdell Center on Ward Street. About a 20-25 minute walk or catch a bus. If you walk, take Kapiolani Street, it has nice shade trees for most of the way. Great oven fired pizza, fresh bread, ginger tea, other food items, fresh fruit and veggies. Pan flute players. Check out the ticket booth while at Blaisdell to see what shows are in town. There is also a farmer’s market in the Ala Moana Center 2nd level parking area by Sears on Saturdays from 8-12.

It's not billed as a resort, so don't expect all the amentities you'd get at some of the places in Waikiki. The public areas are very nice. The lobby includes a tour desk, several shops, a business center (you have to pay to use the internet, copier, printer). Right outside the door is a restaurant open for breakfast only from 0630-1030. Your options are a hot buffet, cold buffet, or both. Kind of pricey, but I guess the hotel figures business travelers will be reimbursed. My room was 2002 in the Waikiki tower. Not fancy and kind of small, but since I worked all day, it wasn't a big deal. The room included a king size bed, a nice balcony with chairs, a small sofa, chair and table, a desk with a hard wire internet connection (no wi-fi), a large flat screen TV, a fridge, a microwave, closet, and small bathroom. Housekeeping is okay; one day during the week had to call the front desk since my room wasn't made up when I returned. They are also skimpy on the amount of towels you get and also the coffee. You get only one 4-cup package per day. From the 2nd floor, you can cross over to the Ala Moana Mall. On the 3rd floor, is the large pool (very nice) and a large fitness center. Towels are provided. Parking is either by valet or self-park in the garage nearby. Self parking is $20 per day.

When we arrived at the room we were in the Waikiki Tower, we did have an ocean peek view, but we had two double beds instead of the King Bed promised. When we called down to the front desk of the hotel to address the issue the front desk staff rudely told us that they won’t help us and we needed to call the 866 number provided. It was 3:00 p.m. in Hawaii, and the 866 number is Pacific Time and the offices were closed. We remained on hold for an emergency agent who agreed to change our room for our second night, but since they were sold out was unable to help us for our first night. She also informed us that there is NO guarantee on a bed preference which means the operator that sold us the room lied to us. The room we were moved to was in the Waikiki tower, had a king size bed, but no view. I will not recommend using BookIt again, not because the customer service was bad, but because they were untruthful in their sale of the room and did not disclose that we were purchasing a condotel room and not a hotel room.

The shower/tub was clean and the water pressure was fine.A med size refrigerator that can store plenty of items is under a counter, along with a microwave and coffee maker. A small closet had a ironing board/iron. There was a cable in the room to connect with your laptop since the wifi only works in the lobby. The front desk will provide you with the password for the wifi. The Plantation Restaurant located outside at the entrance to the hotel is where we ate breakfast. We only ate there because we had meal vouchers, otherwise it is a very expensive b'fast. The continental b'fast is $13; that gets you fruit, yogurt, cereals, and breads. The fruit and yogurt ""bar"" were the only thing of note for me on the continental bar. The full buffet will cost another 5 bucks bringing it up to $18. For that you get hot items like eggs, bacon, etc. There was no outdoor or open air dining that we were aware of, and the air conditioned interior was torturous for early morning.

Spoke to a service attend with LS to complain about hair and he basically told me to ""get over it, it's not that bad, it wont kill you it's just a little hair"". How rude! I had to sleep in the filth for the first night and got bed bug bites - still have the rash - disgusting!!Furthermore, there was no safe in the room and there were hairballs behind the door and dead flies in the closet as soon as I got there - absolutley disgusting!!!To top this all off, the location is so far from everything, felt like I was in the Bronx, not Hawaii - especially for a solo traveller at night - I felt very unsafe returning to the hotel alone.Rooms were tiny and Ala Moana staff were of the rudest people I met in all of Hawaii!In the end I complained to the VIP manager of Luxury suites and happily refunded the first night - still have the horror story though.

It's a large & very busy hotel that is not only used for flight crews, but also apparently the hotel of choice for those coming & going on the cruise ships-could not believe the mountain of luggage piled behind the bell stand. This also explains why our rooms were not available when we arrived. There are no connecting rooms in this hotel & no wi-fi in the rooms, only wired internet-this proved to be problematic when trying to work in the evenings. Was pleasantly surprised by the bathroom-though small, it was nicely done w/a large marble counter & under mount sink. This is the first hotel where towels hung on the towel rack in the bathroom were actually NOT replaced every day, which I truly appreciated. The guestroom pictures on the hotel website show very small wall-mounted tvs, but those have been replaced w/large flat panel models sitting on the desks. Beds are not the greatest (I'm a hotel bed snob, I'll admit!) but they are not the worst I've slept on-getting rid of the ugly old green flowered bedspread for the duration helped, as did bringing my own pillow. We were on the 23rd floor overlooking the marina, Diamond Head (or at least a slice of it that could be seen between 2 buildings!) & the mountains to our left, so no complaints there. The Plantation Cafe is only open for breakfast & that is buffet only. While it's a pretty extensive buffet w/different hot egg choices every day, it was still a bit pricey at $16/person. As others have pointed out, the hotel is connected by walk-way to the Ala Moana hotel & there are numerous food options there for dinner. No bill under the door on the day of check-out which meant a stop at the front desk-fortunately, it was early enough that there was no one else down there. Depending on your individual needs, the hotel may suite perfectly, however, we are heading back in 3 days to spend nearly 2 weeks w/the same client & have asked to stay elsewhere primarily because of the lack of connecting rooms & no wi-fi in the rooms issue.","Phoenix, Arizona","txrus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",118,3.0

This was my 2nd trip to HNL to run the marathon, and unfortunately, this hotel is the closest to the start line. So, unless you want to wake up @ 2:30 a.m. to take a shuttle, or walk a county mile to get to the start line, this was the best option.

I pulled out my confirmaiton sheet which clearly showed an ""oceanveiw"" room. The CSR went back into a room for several minutes & came back out. She asked if I would consider a city view suite instead! I explained as calmly as I could that I had booked & paid for an ""oceanview"", and the main reason was because these rooms were on higher floors away from noise. She went back into her room again & after another several minutes finally came out & agreed to give me the ""oceanview"" room that I had paid for!

The hotel is within walking distance of the convention center, so if you need to be there early in the morning it can be quite convenient. On the other hand there are no real restaurants, bars or coffee shops near by. It is a bit of a desolate area. The one close facility is a very nice open air mall which is also just beside the hotel. You'll have to go here for anything from a quick coffee (no coffee shop or continuously serving restaurant in the hotel) to a sandwich to a drink at the end of the day. The hotel says that it has a poolside bar - that's not true. They've closed the poolside bar and do not allow any alcohol on the poolside deck. There is a bar downstairs in the hotel but it was closed during the week - only open on Friday and Saturday as far as I can recall. We came back on Monday night at 10 pm looking to have a beer to close out the night and since the hotel bar was closed we had no other options. A few other things - if you have an ipad or mac air - i.e. a device without an ethernet port, you will not be able to connect to the internet in your room. there is no wifi throughout the hotel - only on the first three floors. the business center is also a total scam - $0.25 a minute for internet, $0.40/page to print or fax. believe me, it adds up pretty fast. for the price that you pay for the hotel, you'd think that they could provide free internet access and at least let you print your boarding pass for free. Finally, cleanliness - I rated it as poor because there was a short and curly hair in my sheets when I checked in and the mirror had clearly not been cleaned for at least a few guests before me. Not cool. There was also apparently a bedbug found in one of the rooms - that said, I checked carefully and did not see any signs of bedbugs in my room and I understand that management was dealing with the issue. In sum, if you absolutely need to be near the convention center this hotel is fine but nothing special. Otherwise, find somewhere better in Honolulu (or better yet - go to a different island.

Sounded pretty good and the property had been remodeled so I thought, why not try something different. I looked at the different rooms on their website and decided on a city/mountain view in the Waikiki Tower. I was able to check in early, 12:30, and was given room 1727. The room was much smaller than the one I had at the Ilima. There was a small fridge, microwave, and coffee machine, but only coffee mugs and a couple of glasses. I thought this was a little odd considering you had what you needed to make a small meal or snack, but nothing to eat it with or on. Luckily the mall is close by and I bought a small bowl and Chinese soup spoon. I didn't care for the configurations in the room. The t.v. was on the desk, and I guess someone stole the actual remote because there was this other hook-up and I couldn't use the timer. It sits on the desk, so if I used my computer, I had to sit right next to the t.v. The closet was also very small, so not much storage there. These were my issues with the room.However, the view from the lanai was great! It was much noisier than the Ilima, but it felt much more modern. I never used the AC because there was a great breeze blowing, and one night I even left the sliding door open. The bed was comfy and I liked the long hallway from the door to the room. I didn't really hear anyone, except when people would let their doors slam shut, which I feel is such a rude thing to do. The gym was nicely laid out and adequate. I liked being close to Ala Moana Park! I walked/jogged there every morning. Parking was $20 but at least I was guaranteed a spot every night I came in. The staff was great! Everyone I encountered was courteous and friendly. I did sit in the lobby one day just to observe the other guests. It's my opinion that some really felt entitled, so it's no wonder they may feel indifferent to the property. I liked walking over to the mall. There are quite a few stores and shops within walking distance. As you can see from the pictures, it's a decent room and the property is centrally located. This is the first time I've stayed somewhere outside of Waikiki and I'm glad I did. Some of those issues I mentioned aside, I would consider staying here again, perhaps staying in a larger room with an ocean view. I think the best thing anyone can do is ask what exactly they want out of their trip and do the research.

Seeing as the Mall was the reason for choosing the hotel, we stayed in the Kona Tower, whose rooms are cheaper than the Waikiki Tower. Room was very small, outlook was not great, but we didn't have high expectations to begin with.Good: Location near the Mall; bathrooms seem new-ish, good fridge and microwave; 2 self serve laundromats (if a little pricy compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip)Bad: Attitude of staff (never ever got a greeting from any of the bellhops or front doormen); long queues to check in and out; bad plumbing in bathroom (have seen this in other reviews) - the bath does not drain so it's kind of gross showering in your own dirty water that is accumulating and not going down the plug hole; housekeeping is lackadaisical at best (one day our bathroom got wiped down but bed was never made!); not all the gym equipment was working.Having said all that - we had a great time there.....

The hotel's location is one of the best in Honolulu: about a mile's walk to Waikiki beach; a third of a mile to Ala Moana Park; a block away from the Hawaii Convention Center; connected by skybridge to the Ala Moana Mall containing 300 shops and restaurants. The hotel has 2 adjoining towers: the 13-storey Kona Tower where we were billeted, and the 32-storey Waikiki Tower which is striking. The driveway is grand, and can accomodate a couple of dozen cars at any time. Underground parking is more than adequate, and costs $20/overnight for hotel guests (unlimited entry/exit using swipe card). Smart hotel guests park at the Mall parking for free, and walk a hundred feet across the Skybridge to the hotel. The lobby is spacious and elegant, but there should be more staff at the front desk during peak hours. The bellman was professional but not friendly, a trend my wife and I noted throughout our 5-day stay in this hotel. It was our first stay in a Honolulu hotel, and I found a perceptible difference between staff attitude in Ala Moana, and that of hotels in the continental US. I would characterize it as a lack of pride in the facility that they work in. There are 3 elevators in Kona, and 6 in Waikiki, all high-speed, quiet, efficient, and requiring room card access to the residential floors. The longest wait is probably less than 15 seconds. Corridors are airconditioned, wide, clean, and well-lit. Our room was a standard: quite small at 28 sq.m.; view of downtown and mountains; queen bed; smallest TV I've seen in a hotel room (17""); small, decent bathroom with tub; wide desk; couch and armchair; internet is plug-in, as WiFi available only in lobby and common areas.The upside --- safe, fridge, microwave toaster, which are amenities rapidly disappearing from most hotels. No mini-bar. Coin-op laundry on 6th and 13th floors of Kona Tower; not sure about locations in Waikiki Tower. Fitness Center has a complete set of weights machines, at the expense of more space for treadmills of which there are only 4, thus, treadmills are always at a premium. Third-floor pool is about 20 meters long, lightly-salted water, and good for short laps only. Sundeck area is quite large. Hours for fitness center are 5am to 10pm, and pool are 8am to 6pm. Both are accessible by room card key. Three restaurants in the hotel, none of which we tried due to the preponderance of good eating places within walking distance. The tour desk deserves a comment. During peak hours, two staffers would be woefully inadequate (15mins/customer, with about 5 customers in each of 2 lines --- the wait is more than an hour). Though our tour desk staffer seemed to work hard and was very nice, she did try to hard-sell the Pearl Harbor tour to the point of incredulity --- no choice but a 6:30am tour bus pick-up for an 11:15am tour; otherwise, ""you'll miss the 3100 maximum daily tickets handed out, since there are 5000/day who request for tickets"". This sounded totally ridiculous, so we opted to pick up a rental the next morning, had a leisurely breakfast, left the hotel at 8am, arrived at Pearl Harbor 30 mins after, went straight to the counter (No lines!!!) and got 2 free tickets to the 11:15am tour, and had a much better day than if we had taken the bus tour that would start at 6:30am and would pick up passengers from several more hotels.","Winnipeg, Canada","Hobbes2007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",38,3.0

I didn't pay as much as I have paid on previous trips to the island so I knew in advance not to expect the ""Royal Treatment"". It was a place to lay my head while I waited on the sun to come up. I couldn't imagine being there with my kids, but for the price it was a good deal. I did find one thing that I would check on before I stayed. Whether they are doing reairs on the mall next door. I had to listen to a jackhammer all during the day and night if I was in my room. They were repairing the Macy's parking lot and it was non stop the whole time I was there. The trolley picks up right in front of the mall next door. For $2.00 each way. You can catch the Pink or the Red trolley straight to Wakiki Beach. Directly across the street from the hotel is a park that looked a little ""no, no "" to me on my previous trips, but hidden in there is actually a childrens beach park. The look may deter you, but it is actually a cool little place to hang out.","Cedar Hill, Texas","Sylvia S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cedar Hill, Texas</strong>",21,3.0

Parking is an issue if you have a rental car. Views can be bad. Amenities are limited. Pool leaves something to be desired. Front desk staff is ""hit and miss"" as far as friendliness goes. However, we stay at the Ala Moana hotel because we like to be able to walk to the Ala Moana mall to eat and shop (there's a 2nd level catwalk from the hotel to the mall). Also, the Ala Moana beach park, the Ala Wai Yacht Basin, and the Wal-mart and Sam's Club are all in walking distance. I DO NOT feel that the area is unsafe. I have walked from the hotel to the Wal-mart many times by myself.

The retro lobby is graced by an antique Polynesian canoe. Checking in will try your patience - expect at least a half hour wait in a long line. The outdoor pool is big and beautiful but closes early - we were told because that's the deal that they made with the tenants of the condo tower. The breakfast is cafeteria caliber. There are other restaurants including a well-rated Chinese one but we didn't try them. The main selling point is the hotel's fantastic location. It's a few blocks from the beach with ocean views from most or all rooms, adjacent to the don't-miss open-air multilevel Ala Moana shopping center with hundreds of shops and restaurants (and a post office, a branch of City Hall with its own art gallery, and a stage with ongoing entertainment,) and walking distance to the Convention Center. Public transportation is great and there are taxis always waiting at the front for more distant rides. No need to rent a car unless you want to go to the North side of the island. Our bed was comfortable and the elevators were fast. There's a coin-op laundry and you can get coins at the front desk. There was a plumbing problem and although Maintenance came to fix it pretty rapidly, the guy was unsuccessful and we had to switch rooms late at night - not too pleasant. I think we should have been comped a night due to that trouble.

A half hour later we actually got it.That set the mood for the week. Tickets to a show that we were to pick up at the concierge desk ""disappeared.""

The room is comfortable, and the hotel's location (adjacent to the mall) provides some inexpensive dining options, which can be hard to come by in Honolulu.

When I opened the door, the guard just stared at us looking bewildered. When we asked him what he wanted, he asked us if we were ""with the Jewish party."" When we told him we were not, he simply turned and walked away. No explanation. No apology. When we reported this to the front desk on checking out that morning, they didn't apologize either and brushed it off saying something about how the guard probably made a mistake. Probably? Is it customary for their security people to unlock and open doors in the middle of the night without knocking and identifying themselves first?That particular incident I have to believe was unique.

On doing this we were told that our agent had not booked the correct room and if we wanted an ocean view room we would have to call back to the UK (which has a 19hour time difference) to get them to call the Hotel to authorise the upgrade, we thought this was mean on the Hotels part considering they knew we were on Honeymoon and had travelled an extremely long distance, NOT helpful or apologetic at all.Appeared to be a very quiet hotel, no welcoming bar, never found the restaurant, attached to huge shopping centre (NOT a plus) bedroom was over back entrance to hotel so woken at 5am every morning by deliveries/bin men, staff rude, not close to the beach, 1hours walk to centre of Honolulu, pool dirty, and hotel located on what seemed like to busiest junction in the entire universe.

While it is a perfectly adequate-ordinary hotel, it is truly nothing special - and a little bit of special is nice when you come all the way to Hawaii. The room's TV is tiny. The hotel lounge bar is closed, so there is nowhere to get a drink and relax at the end of the day. The on-site Chinese restaurant isn't very good, and there is no other restaurant on site. There is no room service. The cafe is only open for breakfast (which was good). You need to walk to the shopping mall next door for restaurants or anything else - the neighborhood has no night life or charm. Going to the beach is a 10 minute hike (NOT ""just across the street""), and the beach park is undergoing construction. I visited a friend at her hotel on Waikiki beach: beachside restaurant and bar with quiet music playing, access to the water, great views, lovely garden, nice walks on recently renovated city streets and shopping/dining - and decided the Ala Moana hotel's proximity to the convention center wasn't worth the minuses. Ala Moana hotel is clean, professional and reasonably priced (nice touches: small fridge and coffee maker in room, free internet and accessible outlets, little store with drink/snacks) - but very ordinary.

I honestly liked the fact that it was not right on Waikiki in the midst of all that traffic and craziness. When I wanted to access the beach, it was an easy and pretty walk. But in the evening, it was quiet and removed from the zoo that can be Waikiki.The hotel is quite large, and the views from the upper floors are spectacular. Elevators come quickly for such a large place.

I called the front desk and asked for another room. In the interim, there was also a bug crawling in the bed. I called the front desk again. Someone came up immediately and checked the bathroom. He used his finger to touch the smears on the wall, and told me that it was not feces. Then, without washing his hands, he searched the bed for the bug. He found the bug hidden under the sheets and removed it, while declaring that it was not a bedbug. Shortly after he left, the assistant housekeeping manager came w/ a housekeeper. He inspected the bathroom wall and declared that he did not see feces. Then he and the housekeeper stripped the bed and declared that they could not find the bug. I told him that the other person from housekeeping already removed the bug and wiped the bathroom wall; he appeared annoyed when I told him that I did not know the name of the other gentleman who arrived before they did. A little while later the front desk called me and informed me that they would ""give"" me another room even though the manager found no evidence of feces or a bug in the bed, in a tone like they were doing me a favor. The other room was only slightly better-the sheets always had dirt somewhere on them, and I removed all of the linens at bedtime, with the exception of a fitted sheet.

Located one block from the Hawaii Convention Center and one block from Ala Moana Beach park and across the parking deck from the Macy's end of Ala Moana Shopping Center, this hotel met all of my needs for attending the conference while maintaining a healthy diet and workout routine. I walked to my meetings and to the Ala Moana Shopping Center daily for lunch of delicious poke (at Banggaa Banggaa) or grilled fish and vegetables, and occasionally absolutely fabulous chocolate cake for dessert (at La Palm D'Or). I ran in the Ala Moana Park every morning- 2.75 miles around the perimeter- beautiful scenery, friendly encounters with locals engaged in their own fitness routine- walking, running, surfing and rowing. I shopped for fresh fruit, milk and breakfast cereal at Foodland at Ala Moana Center and kept breakfast, tea and some healthy snacks in my room. I averaged about $10 daily for breakfast, snacks, and lunch together. When I ate out for dinner, I was able to keep the leftovers in my refrigerator for the next day's meal. I worked out in the fitness center which has unusually good fitness equipment for a hotel. The view from my window in the Waikiki Tower (35th floor) featured the high rise yacht club condominiums, but when seated on the lanai, I had a beautiful view of Ala Moana Beach Park and the yacht harbor.If I were in Hawaii on vacation, I would probably stay elsewhere, but for a business trip centered on activities at the Convention Center, this was absolutely perfect. If I enjoyed shopping for leisure, I might choose this hotel for vacation, too, since the Ala Moana Center has terrific shopping and restaurants- all a short walk away.The room was clean and well furnished, though not luxurious- a good value.

My room in the Kona Tower was not spacious but certainly not the smallest I've ever had. There was room for a double bed, a large desk/dresser, and a chair. The furnishings seemed new although the bed was covered with an old-style bedspread. I liked having a coffee maker, microwave and fridge in the room (note, when using the coffee maker, it's important that the lid be on the pot while brewing!). My partial-view room mostly had a view of the other tower and a parking lot, but I was able to see the ocean too, so I guess partial-view is an accurate description!The high-speed Internet was free (yay!) but not wireless. I was barely able to get the cable to stretch far enough so I could stretch out on the bed while using my laptop. The exercise room was quite nice, modern and clean, with several cardio machines and weight machines. The gift shops had all the essentials as well as a good selection of non-essential gifty items. It was great to be able to walk back and forth from the convention center easily. The mall with its shops and restaurants was also close by. For runners/walkers, Ala Moana Park is just a couple of blocks away, and you can get about three scenic miles in by going there and following the path around its perimeter. Cab rides to the Waikiki Beach area are around $6-10 but it's not a bad walk either.

The hotel location was a perfect base for touring or shopping at the Ala Moana shopping center, which is connected by a walkway. The room had a great view and had a sufficiently stocked kitchen. Everything seemed to be perfect until we went to bed on the first night. The king bed in the bedroom was just fine, but the mattress on the sofa bed was very uncomfortable – thin, hard and lumpy.We called the property manager the next day and requested roll away beds or a replacement sofa bed. She mentioned that no one has ever complained before; otherwise they would have taken a pro-active approach. We learned that the Ala Moana hotel does not have rollaway beds, so we were given the option of switching to a studio or another one-room suite which had the same foot print and furniture as our suite; she noted that the sofa bed might be the same, though. We wanted to be reasonable and make it easy for everyone, so we opted to stay in our room because we decided to pile blankets and pillows on the mattress for added padding.Unfortunately, on the second night, the sofa bed frame actually fell apart and my husband fell into the middle of the frame. If it wasn’t so unfortunate, the whole situation was almost laughable. We called the property manager the next morning and a maintenance person was sent in the afternoon to fix the frame. The following day, another maintenance person came by to deliver another mattress to put on top of our sofa bed mattress. Overall, the property managers did a good job of trying to rectify the situation. The unfortunate thing is that our sleep was terribly uncomfortable during the whole stay and with the added surprise of the frame falling apart, we really didn't feel rested during this vacation.I had requested one day of towel service after the first night and the property manager waived the $30 fee (which, by the way, is a really steep towel service fee) as a concession for the uncomfortable mattress. She was willing to do this even before the frame incident.The condo itself would have been perfect, but when I think about the overall stay, I would not stay there again. This is really unfortunate as our family travels all the time and Oahu is one of our frequent destinations. I've experienced all kinds of hotel sofa beds in my travels, but this rated as one of the most uncomfortable. If you’re considering this unit and plan to use the sofa bed, be sure to check whether the mattress was replaced/upgraded. If it was, then it might be a worthwhile stay. If you plan to use only the bedroom, then you'll be fine. If not for the uncomfortable sleep that cast a shadow upon an otherwise wonderful vacation, I would have been able to highly recommend this unit.As a side note, I also received quotes for other privately-owned properties at the Ala Moana Hotel after I had already committed to unit 807. Two other quotes (with rooms on higher floors) came in with a cleaning fee that was half the cost of ours.","San Francisco, California","itsasmallworld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",110,3.0

If mall-shopping is your thing, this is the hotel for you, as it has a walkway to the large Ala Moana Shopping Center. One of the other upsides is a very close-by 7-11 we often used to get supplies in the morning (water, caffeine, and Sudafed, since we were both sick).Now, here's where it gets a little hinky.

I thought this was strange and made entry difficult. Also it is NOT heated and while it is Hawaii and the outside temps were warm, the pool was COLD! Too cold to enjoy or even get into after sunning.Overall, for price, it was a good experience.","Provo, Utah","Carenlzn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Provo, Utah</strong>",3,4.0

My questions about ""when is check out time"" and ""how to get to Waikiki"" were answered, rather bluntly, even before I finished asking the question. My room was located at the back of the hotel and had no view (therefore only $99 a night). The room was small, but adequate for a solo traveler.

We go to self park and can easily see that self park is full along with a BIG SIGN that says lot full. The attendent tells us to park ANYWHERE just not in a handicap parking. Ok so cars are double parked and moving cones, just horrible but we got some parking that night. Sat night we come back to the hotel late again and once again are told VALET is full, we asked why and are told by the Valet that it's because of RUMORS (a night club). How can they allow a cluber to park in Valet/self park and not have parking for their PAYING GUEST! Once again we go to self parking and once again are told just park anywhere. Again we find parking NEXT to a handicap space. The space does not say no parking however there are white lines. So we figure it's ok to park there. Next morning we get into our car and find a $260 parking ticket. It's says we parked in a handicap stall. We did not park in a handicap stall. So to make a long story short, we called the Guest Service Manager (Daryl) who was extremely RUDE from when he answered the phone. He basically said to bad it was our falt and he aint going to help. We decide to call back and speak with a higher up manager (hotel manager-RON) and we get treated like crap once again. He would not help us but take off the parking charge, of course he would there was not PARKING! We thought at least he could help a little more to offset our bill but NO he said he couldn't.

The room my boyfriend and I stayed at was small, but comfy. It was cleaned everyday and the service was good.

It was an aweome trip and amazing experience. The hotel itself was fine. My room was small, but did the job. Nothing fancy. In fact, older and it showed - on the walls, in the furniture, etc. Got a good night's sleep and was happy to have a fridge and microwave. I was upgraded to an ocean view at check-in, but that room was not ready yet, and after a long day of travel, I prefered to get in and get settled so I could go explore. FYI - my rate was just $109/night!!!! Amazing, I think. For that reason only I'd stay there again and maybe rent a car... would have to do the math.The Ala Moana Shopping Center/Mall is a five minute walk from the hotel and has every high end store you can imagine - Gucci, Prada, etc. It also has more mainstream stores and plenty of places to get a manicure, which was perfect, because I needed one! The hotel is VERY close to the Convention Center (probably about or less than a 5-minute walk), and is about a 7-10 minute walk across a busy intersection to the Ala Moana Park - which is - the BEACH! I jogged along the water a few mornings and it was breathtaking (literally and figuratively!) The beach was not very crowded but the park was - with locals having BBQs and gatherings - it was pretty cool.The other conference hotel was the Marriott Waikiki and it was closer to all of the action (shops, restaurants) and to a busier beach. So to get to all of that - I had to take a cab. That was about $10 each way.The Ala Moana Hotel has an activities desk which helped arrange tours, but the desk has spotty hours, so book when you see someone there just in case. Also, you can arrange airport pick-up through Roberts for $9! (That was what it cost for me, not sure if it is per person.)

It is about two blocks from the convention center, so if you are having meeting there, which I was, this is a sensible hotel choice. However, it's not the best for the beach or for finding places to eat. The Ala Moana Shopping Mall has a food court, and there are the strip clubs in the neighborhood around the back side of the place for your night time entertainment, but that's about it. One small advantage to this place is that you are much closer to real Honolulu neighborhoods than you would be in most of Waikiki.

The front desk staff looked at me blankly when I asked what the fax number was including the international dialling code. Unbelievably the front desk staff also had the cheek to tell me that I would have to wake up at 3 am to talk to the new person on shift to ask if they could prepare my check out receipt for my departure at 4.30 the next day. Apparently it was not possible for the front desk staff to write a note to the next shift. The hotel owners need to send their staff on MacDonalds customer relations training!

We have stayed in this hotel many times before, and though it's not a fancy top of the line hotel, it's in a great location adjacent to the Ala Moana Shopping Mall, which makes shopping and eating really convenient. We had reserved Kama'aina rooms at a slightly discounted rate, which is a special rate reserved for Hawaii residents - we have lived in Kauai for almost 15 years. The check-in into 2 of the rooms was really pleasant and we had a great experience at the front desk - the clerk was delightful. The rest of our party was checking in at a later time that evening, which was our daughter returning from college in Europe. When checking in, we had a different clerk, her name was Joyce, and this lady was the exact opposite of the very nice lady who checked us in earlier. We were told that we couldn't have the Kama'aina rate on our 3rd room because my daughter didn't have her Hawaii ID with her, even though we were paying for all 3 rooms on our credit card. This in itself would have not been such a bad experience, hadn't it been for ignorance and bad attitude of the clerk. In the end, we received our Hawaii resident discount, but came away with a really bad feeling border-lining on having been the victim of racism (yes, there is reverse racism in the islands against “Haole's” which are Caucasian Americans). This happened on the evening shift of 9/28/10.This is a good example of how one bad employee can have a big effect on your business.

Hilton Prince Kuhio ROCKS all over Ala Moana. But if you find yourself staying there - Waikiki Tower is a MUST! Otherwise your view, zero balcony, and the trek to the other tower every time you come and go is rotten. There were 3 hangers in my closet upon arrival and none of them had clips to hang pants. It took two visits for housekeeping to finally come up with enough extra crappy wire hangers. The hair dryer kept shorting out so they brought a different one but it had the same problem, just not quite as bad. The bathroom is dinky - barely enough room to get around the toilet when you want to take a shower. They don't vacuum. The floor is dirty. There is no room service.

We were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the harbor. The rooms are very clean and modern. One thing about some hotels in Honolulu is that you might get a room that feels musty and not so clean. However, you never get the feel of that at Ala Moana Hotel. On the negative side, the televisions are fairly small in each room. The size of the television is more like the size you'd put in your kids room rather than a hotel room. The pool is nothing special. Unfortunately, the pool is near the parking lot of the Ala Moana Mall, so do not expect too much peace and quite. However, the biggest positive about this hotel is its proximity to the mall. You literally walk across the parking structure to get to the mall. So if your stay in Honolulu is not to spend much time at the hotel, but go to the mall and do the other tourist activities, the hotel has a great centralized location. As for the service, the service is below average at best. It takes quite a bit of time to check in if there is a line. There is a VIP line, but the individuals working there tend not to call over people from the regular line if there is no one they are serving.

It is lighter, more modern while still keeping some of the old sense of place. Of course it's location is a big plus. And alas, parking is still a big problem, especially when the hotel is full. The price for valet parking is $20.00 per night, self-parking for a single woman in the dingy garage is not recommended by me. and yes, they will now tow you away if you park in the shopping center's lot overnight.Another missing element is a cosy restaurant with good food. Even an all-day coffee shop would be nice to find, tucked away somewhere, maybe even with a wine bar.

As for my husband and I, getting away from Maui for some down time was all we we're looking forward to. After seeming like forever trying to find parking, I demanded for my husband to drop me off so I can speak to the manager in charge to resolve this issue. (More like a nightmare!) We we were able to get a refund on one night of parking totaling $15.00. I believe we should have been given a voucher for a two night stay for the inconvenience after being told by parking attendance that due to the many locals staying at this establishment, there was no parking. Now why didn't they mention this on their website when we were looking for a night out on the town. Was this an oversight or did we have to discover this on our own. How dreadful and inconvenient this whole nightmare was. We local people deserve more than this! Other than that, the maid service was fantastic, but I don't believe we will be returning. Aloha.... Aqua Resorts here we come! At least they have valet parking and convenient parking available. Oh yes, one more thing. After checking in at about 11:00, we were given the wrong room key where we discovered all the way up on the 31st floor, that it was occupied. We local people like to keep it local, but when we are treated in a less than touristic way, I think there's something with this picture. We all contribute to trying to keep the economy going, but business and pleasure sure gave a whole new meaning to what we experienced. Have a nice stay and be sure to ask, is the lot full.

Most recently I was on Oahu for lasik surgery and stayed at the Ala Moana because it is walking distance to the surgery center. I wanted to walk back to the hotel after surgery since my vision would be impaired. I requested early checkin while making online reservations. When arriving there I was told nothing was available for early checkin. That's fine, it was just a request, however the front desk agent was very cold, sterile, uncaring about my reasoning for early checkin. Basically in Hawaii we say she had no ""Aloha"". At least when you are denying a request it would be nice to have a smile and friendly words. She was cold and uncaring, I got the surgery done and walked back to the hotel to checkin. Original front desk agent gone so different front desk agent this time and she was astounded that I didn't checkin earlier. She was upset and said to me ""I don't understand why didn't she let you checkin earlier"" She was warm and friendly and oozed ""Aloha"" so the checkin was about as good as I've ever had even though i could barely see after surgery and had to be shown where to sign on the form.Another time I was given my cardkeys at checkin and when i got to the room door was already open and the maid was still there cleaning the room. So I asked the maid when will the room be ready and she said about 30 minutes. So I went shopping at Ala Moana Shopping Center and returned about an hour later. Tried the cardkey and it didn't work. I had been give two card keys, even thought I was a solo traveler, and had put the other cardkey in my backpack. So I retrieved the other cardkey and it also didn't work. Went to the front desk and the agent told me to meet security at the room. 5 minutes later the security guard came tried both cards and it didn't work. I went back downstairs and told the agent that the cards didn't work. She explained to me that the cards can go bad if they are put in your wallet, near your credit cards. Both cards? One of which stayed in my backpack and was nowhere near my wallet. She blamed me for the problem. I never tried any of the cards since the door was open and the maid cleaning the room. I think the card wasn't programmed correctly or the card reset after the maid finished cleaning the room. I'm not sure about this because I don't know hotel procedures. What I do feel is that whatever happened wasn't my fault. I didn't do anything wrong, but the front desk agent told me I was at fault. That ruined the trip from the beginning.Bottom line is that you can get good service and a good room sometimes. At other times it can be bad service and a bad room.

They're trying to be green, so they have several signs around the room explaining how they're doing this (ex: in the bathroom the sign says ""if you want fresh towels- throw them in the tub, if you want to reuse the towels just leave them hanging up, ect). The location isn't bad, but it is a bit noisy because of street traffic (where is it not, though?) and the Ala Moana shopping center is a short walk away. The shopping center has a fairly good mix of expensive and inexpensive stores, and lots of good food places. I personally think it's better than staying in Waikiki because there are more options to eat at local places and walmart is really close by if you forgot to buy something for the trip.We had a room in the tower facing the city and mountains, but there is a window by the elevators where you can view the ocean. The beach is also very close by.There are several different gift shops on the main floor, and the prices aren't too terrible. They have t-shirt for only $15, when they could probably be charging more. Food can be a bit expensive, but there are a lot of options if you don't feel like going out to find something.The absolute WORST thing about this hotel is that they do NOT clean the carpets. I noticed a blob of chocolate with ice cream on the floor under the night stand and several stains all over the carpet.

As it turns out, the Ala Moana Hotel was a plesant surprise and provided us with an enjoyable stay while in Honolulu. If you want to shop, this is the place to stay!After flying 14 hours to get to Honolulu, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist (Barbara) who kindly gave us an early check-in to the room. We were also given a 10% off voucher for Macy's (which lasted 3 days). The rooms were comfortable and secure and there was little noise from outside. Our room was fine for 2 people for 2 weeks as it had an in-room safe, free cable TV, free and fast internet access, microwave etc. The pool area was nice after a long day shopping also! The room was cosy and had a mountain view only but for $129 per night + tax we were very happy with the hotel. The reception staff, room sttandants and bell desk staff were very friendly and helpful. For any last minute needs, a 7-11 style store is located in the hotel and is open from 7am to 11pm. Free Hawaiian-style entertainment in the Pakele Lounge on Thursday nights.We did notice some areas that might need improvement - limited nightly restautant options in the hotel, slow and expensive internet access in the lobby and the coffee maker in the room was tained with an bad aftertaste (hence, we bought a cheap kettle from Sears). Apart from that, the hotel was great!Perhaps the best aspect of this hotel is being so close to the Ala Moana Centre! The hotel connects to level 2 of Macy's and is a short stroll over the flyerover. This proved dangerous as there were too many bargains to be bought! Also close by is Ross For Less and Walmart which are also great stores for affordable bargains. The Ala Moana Centre had some great restaurants which proved useful at night - Ruby Tuesday, Islands Burgers, Longhi's Restaurant and Macaroni Italian Restaurant.We would recommend this hotel for serious shoppers!",Brisbane,"Itinerary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",29,4.0

We stayed 8 nights in late March when Hawaii is not crowded and all the beaches, except Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Beach Park, are relatively deserted on the weekdays. The biggest plus is its location, next to Oahu’s largest shopping mall, Ala Moana Shopping Center. There is no better place to experience the company of locals than in the mall’s food court and mainline stores. The check-in was smooth and quick and the room was adequate for its price range. The maid service was adequate, always enough towels and the balcony table, where birds gathered for bits of food in the morning, cleaned everyday. It was interesting to see the Hawaiian professionals meeting almost daily in the hotel’s conference rooms or a 20th high school reunion in the hotel’s main restaurant. The local professionals and reunion goers seem like the same people you see in any big city or small town meeting or reunion except the locals wear aloha shirts or t-shirts and colorful dresses, and are relaxed. We did not try the hotel restaurants since the adjacent shopping mall and outside the city have much more choices, for example, Islands (burgers, chicken, fish) or California Pizza Kitchen at the mall.The downside of our stay is the hotel’s valet parking. Due to a shortage of rental cars, we had a choice of a Dodge Charger or a Hyundai premium sedan. We chose the Charger to an unknown Hyundai sedan. As much as we liked the Charger’s acceleration and power, a member(s) of the hotel’s valet parking staff liked the Charger more. After our fourth night, in the morning, we discovered food on the driver’s seat. After our fifth night, in the morning, we suspected a difference in the odometer and had the odd sensation that someone was making the car his home. On the sixth night, we wrote the mileage down. In the morning, we discovered a difference of 2 miles. The hotel’s overflow parking lot is only two blocks away if the car was parked there. We reported the mileage discrepancy to the hotel’s assistant manager. He apologized and said that he “will look into the matter”. Thereupon, we switched from valet parking to self-parking.

The closest beach is across the street but it's a good walk so it's better to drive. The Ala Moana Beach is not ideal because of all the rocks. You definitely need aqua shoes for this particular beach. The front desk staff was friendly and we were able to book a spacious one bedroom suite on the spot for 10 nights (our original reservations to a privately owned suite were cancelled unbeknownst to us but that's another story of it's own). There is a $15/day charge for self parking in their underground garage. Parking was extremely difficult and filled up fast. If you got back to the hotel after 7pm the legitimate parking spots were often taken up and many cars ended up making their own parking spots. Upon arrival to the room we found a huge dead cockroach in the bedroom. That was an immediate turn off and it got me nervous thinking of there were other creepy crawlers that would manifest. Luckily we didn't experience or see any roaches or bed bugs throughout the rest of our stay. The one bedroom suite was surprisingly bigger than what we expected. The decor is contemporary and updated. There was a firm king size bed in the master and a double sofa sleeper in the living room. The mattress to the sofa sleeper was awful! The springs were felt on every square inch of the mattress and it was thin and downright uncomfortable. There was a small kitchenette suitable for cooking but the kitchen is not stocked with any pots/pans or cooking utensils so it was pointless. Who goes on a vacation 2400 miles from their home and packs cooking supplies in their suitcase? There are 2 mini refrigerators which was nice as well as a convection oven and a microwave oven to reheat leftovers. There is no room service in the hotel. The air conditioning worked excellent and there were 2 separate controls for the A/C for the living room and master bedroom. The bathroom was spacious. I was extremely disappointed with swimming pool. It's not heated and even in the peak of the hot summer season the pool water was extremely cold. For some reason there is always a cold breeze/trade winds blowing in the pool deck making it even more cold. The most shallow part of the pool is 3 feet and really not suitable for young children. They have extremely strict pool rules and will only allow arm bands and vests for the kids. Noodle sticks, other floatation devices and toys are not allowed. The pool deck is the worst. It's made of rock gravel and hurts when you walk on it. The loose gravel rocks also get into the pool so beware when you walk and step painfully on them. This entire pool needs to be upgraded. Our children were extremely disappointed that the pool wasn't more kid friendly. The worst experience was when my husband's finger got shocked and burned when the hair dryer plug sparked a fire. After administering first aid from our room with ice, water, antibiotic ointment and a bandaid we called the front desk to report the incident and they sent someone to give us a replacement hair dryer. The switch to the replacement hair dryer seemed faulty so we had to have another one sent up. The next morning my husband reported the incident to the guest relations manager and all he did was take notes, offer my husband ice and a bandaid and asked if he wanted to file a report with security. My husband declined the ice and bandaid because the incident occurred the night before. When he asked what filing a report to the security would do he did not get an answer so he declined to file a report. The management failed to send someone to our room to check the faulty hair dryer and bathroom outlet. No one ever contacted my husband to follow up on his injury. Thank goodness the hotel bathroom did not go up in flames and injure our 3 young children. So much for customer service and satisfaction. After this experience I'll be looking for another hotel next time we visit Oahu.","San Francisco, California","iluvhawaii3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,3.0

It is a fantastically huge swimming area with no waves and great amenities provided.The pool on level 3 is a good size and towels are provide, even allowing guests to take them over to the beach and return the same day or next morning.There are a number of convenience/gifts shops on the lobby level.We tipped the housekeeping $3 per room per night and gave an Aussie present per room per night, and the housekeepers were happy with that.Before shopping at Macys go to level 4 with photo ID and pick up your 10% discount card which lasts one month. Some of the cosmetics are not available for this discount.The Ala Moana shopping centre opens from 9-9pm most days but closes at 6pm on Sundays.Waikiki Beach is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel, but buses and trolleys go there frequently, leaving from across the beach park.There are two banks around the corner from the hotel.Sts Peter and Paul Catholic Church is just a quick walk of 2 short blocks and it offers Saturday afternoon Reconciliation from 3.30-4.30pm, and Saturday evening Mass at 5pm with beautiful singing. And numerous Masses are held on Sunday mornings.The Ward Cinema complex is a 12-15 minute walk away, and take your own mug because they offer free softdrinks from the dispensers. Several films show at the same time over 15 cinemas.Walmart is also a short walk away and offers everything.Taxis are permamently stationed at the entrance to the hotel so there is never any waiting. The bellhop counter has a scale in case you want to weigh your luggage, and the daily newspaper is provided free from this counter if you are early enough to get it but it is only 75c anyway.I hope this helps anyone who is considering the hotel, I put in the things that I would have liked to know from a family point of view.

A couple things went wrong with this hotel:1) No parking was available. We were forced to park at the mall since the entire parking lot was full. When we spoke with the manager, he gave us an ""excuse"" about how they e-mailed everyone saying parking isn't guaranteed. Although I did not receive an e-mail, he still could not guarantee a parking stall and ultimately ended up not helping us out at all.2) Hotel staff are rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. While standing in line to check-in, the staff couldn't even manage the line since people were constantly cutting in front of others. When we were finally helped, the receptionist breezed through our check-in so quickly, she failed to inform us of some important information about our stay... like where the Kona Tower elevators were, for instance.I would not recommend staying at this hotel. Being a local here on Oahu, this was the worst experience I have had.

It is, however, conveniently located right beside a very nice mall called the Ala Moana Center, which offers great shopping and a nice food court so you don't have to look far for a place to eat. Rooms are alright -- a little small but most likely you will be spending most of your time outdoors on tour or at the beach/mall so it doesn't really matter much. Cleanliness is okay, although I did notice a small cockroach in the bathroom one night. Service is generally ok, but it seems like the staff just does the bare minimum to be polite. There was, however, one very rude attendant at the front desk named Melissa. The night before our flight was to leave Hawaii, we just wanted to ask her how long it would take to get to the airport if we left at 7 in the morning (and if it would be cheaper to take the shuttle or a taxi for a party of 4). We also wanted to inquire about how crowded the airport usually gets in the morning so we could estimate the best time for us to leave the hotel to get to the airport. Melissa rudely rebuffed us and told us to call the airport ourselves to ask how crowded it usually gets in the morning. She also at first did not want to call the taxi company to ask how much their rate would be -- just lazily giving us a grossly inaccurate estimate ($40 per head, when it turned out to be actually $40 total for the four of us when I pressed her to call). Now these are questions that normally any front desk would be able and willing to answer for guests at the blink of an eye, but all Melissa would say is: ""I don't know these things, I never leave this island."" Good thing her colleague who passed by noticed how upset I was getting and gave me all the information I needed very courteously. Overall though, value for money is okay as we paid only $108 per night for twin sharing.

Unfortunately, the last 3 or 4 stays (taken in sometime in the past 2 years) have been very frustrating for us. Once the hotel made online booking available, the excellent service that we used to get went downhill!!! Booking online is supposed to be a convenience, as long as you don't have any ""special requests"" or use a special rate. We booked online and got the $89 Kamaaina rate for the Kona Tower. The one thing that the website fails to mention is that if you request 2 double beds with that rate, you won't get them because the Kona Tower doesn't have them and the hotel will switch your rooms, but for a higher rate. Also, we were told that ""requests"" made on the website aren't always honored. When I suggested that they take the requests off of the website, the front desk clerk told me that I should make that suggestion to the hotel because my voice would probably be better heard than theirs...talk about passing the buck and not being real helpful!! Don't get me wrong, if I hadn't had this exact same problem the last 3 or 4 times I went there, I would be raving about this hotel, it's super convenient, very comfortable and the $89 Kamaaina rate is the best I've found in the Waikiki area, but.......if you need something other then a queen size bed with a pull-out couch, it's SO NOT WORTH IT!!!","Kapaa, Hawaii","JenContrades</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapaa, Hawaii</strong>",0,2.0

I traveled to Honolulu to participate in the Honolulu Marathon on 12/13/09. I booked a room at the AMH for the night before as it was only a short walking distance to the start line. I called the hotel around 2:00 p.m. that day to confirm my room & ask about ammenities, such as mirco/fridge, etc. I was advised check in was at 4:00 p.m. and they were not allowing any early check in so not to arrive until after 4:00 p.m. My husband & I finished our shopping & arrived at the hotel around 4:15 with my dinner in hand to take up to my room. I about died when I saw there was a line the entire length of the lobby with a MINIMUM of 100 people....all trying to check in.....seroiusly! Worst yet, they were not even fully staffed & there were three check out counters not even being used. I was so angry. The last thing I wanted to do 12 hours before running 26 miles was stand on my feet for 2 hours. Thank goodness my wonderful husband stood in line for me while I waited in a chair in the lobby, however most people weren't that lucky. My husband made many friends during his 1 + hour stint in line, and everyone he spoke with was there for the marathon. This hotel is the closest to the start line, so obviously a very popular choice. The hotel knew how many people were set to check in that day. The marathon has been running for 25+ years, so this wasn't their first rodeo. So, my question is WHY wasn't this more organized? Why didn't they have every available station open? Why didn't they at least let people check in early & leave their bags if there room wasn't ready? When I FINALLY arrived in my room, my dinner was cold, so thank goodness for the one plus of the room.....the microwave. I had paid for an oceanview room, which I didn't even get to use. My husband & I had plans to sit on our balcony & enjoy our dinner. By the time we got to the room the sun had gone down, it was getting dark, and it was an hour before bedtime!

The hotel we normally stay at (Hawaii Prince Hotel) was sold out and so we chose to stay at the Ala Moana because of their $99 per night special. The location was great for us because we did want to do some shopping at the Ala Moana Shopping Center after our workshops. However, upon check-in (which was a rather late 4pm), our room was not ready and the front office agent refused to upgrade us to another category, so after some deliberation with another agent, they found us a room they thought was suitable for the rate we were paying. We got to the room and was shocked at how tiny the room was. There was barely any room to walk between the desk and the bed. The TV was kinda mounted up and was also very tiny. My friend and I were not planning on sleeping together and the room had only one bed and a sofa bed, so we had housekeeping come up and make up the sofa bed for us. Once the sofa bed was opened up, there was practically zero room to move around in that room. The air conditioner was the old fashioned kind (not central air) and I guess they keep it turned off while no one is occupying the room, so the room was hot and stale smelling when we first arrived and when we turned it on, it was a bit on the noisy side. The trash can in the room is so tiny that we filled it up within the first half hour we were there and I guess some of the other guests felt the same because we saw small bags of trash in the hallways outside people's rooms. We also found a headband in the room that did not belong to either of us, so I don't think the room was thoroughly cleaned. I have worked in the hotel/resort industry for quite some time and I have to say that I was not impressed by this hotel at all, in fact, I am surprised that they are considered a three and half star hotel. One thing I did like though was the fact that there are microwaves in the rooms. One thing is for sure though, I highly doubt we will stay at this hotel again.

There was a big note saying printing might be slow, but after waiting 10 minutes, the boarding passes still hadn't printed. That is totally ridiculous. Overall, the atmosphere at the hotel was dismal and the staff was unresponsive and unhelpful. I got the feeling everyone was doing only what was absolutely essential and nothing more. We had stayed at another hotel for the first 4 days of the trip with a bigger room, smaller price tag, and helpful, friendly, smiling staff. I would go back there again, but probably not to the Ala Moana.","Groton, New York","SophiesMom4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Groton, New York</strong>",26,3.0

This hotel is a nice hotel, very close (walking distance) to the convention center and right next door to the huge shopping center Ala Moana Shopping center. The hotel has two towers. It is imperative to stay in the newer one which is the Wakiki Tower. The rooms in this tower are very modern and had all amenities including a wet bar with fridge, sink, coffee maker, etc. We paid for an ocean view but I have to say the property is about two blocks from the beach and while ocean view was nice it was not necessary. The Ala Moana Beach Park is huge and is a beautiful beach but is a a few blocks. Nice pool area and gym. Steam room not great but sauna nice. What we did enjoy was the close proximity to the many restaurants and shops located in the shopping center. Plus parking the rental car in the shopping center parking lot rather than paying for the valet was well worth the savings. While we would not stay here if staying for an extended period of time, it was perfect for its proximity to convention center and shopping.","Juno Beach, Florida","Turkswedding</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Juno Beach, Florida</strong>",54,4.0

The parking is expensive. The hotel lobby gets kind of loud on the weekend in the evenings. They have a nightclub called Rumors where the cops are called pretty frequently. The hotel's location is very convenient to the mall which is a quick walk to for breakfast. And I'd either get a breakfast add-on to your stay or do a walk over to the mall because the store inside the hotel is a little outrageous with their prices, too. Walmart is a quick 2-minute drive from the hotel. We walked to Ala Moana Park with a great beach for the youngsters. The water was very warm and calm. My 3-year old son had an allergy (very unusual) to the detergent used to clean the sheets. He got hives which we remedied with a visit to urgent care and a call to housekeeping. Housekeeping staff was very pleasant and helpful They were the ones who made our stay the best! Once they found out about the allergic reaction, they washed all his sheets and towels separately in hot water to wash out the detergent for every day of the rest of our stay. My only complaint is that management of the hotel didn't call to check and make sure everything had been resolved, meaning that they didn't care or they were never told. Upon arrival, we asked for a Waikiki tower upgrade. The only benefit really was two beds instead of one. The view the registration clerk kept boasting about wasn't as great as anticipated. Instead of having a view of the beach, we got a back view of some parking structures and older hotel buildings in the dark, dingier part of Honolulu. But, we did get a little lanai which was nice to sit out on.It was a good stay overall. If you were paying and had a choice though, I'd think you could find something better with relatively similar in amenities. If you're coming for Waikiki, definitely find something a bit closer.

The first year my baby was only 3 weeks old, so my partner came with me. Now each year they come at the end of the conference and we spend an extra couple of days. I have also stayed here for random 1-nite trips to Honolulu (we live on a neighbor island). When we go to Honolulu, we usually try to fit in shopping, so the bridge over to the Ala Moana mall is awesome. If you read the reviews on here they seem uneven, and I think that is because of the difference in the 2 towers. Both towers have recently been updated and the rooms feel very fresh, but the Kona tower has much smaller rooms and smaller beds. The Waikiki tower is probably only about $20 more a nite for king bed and full lanai (balcony), so it is worth it if you're her on vaca. The partial ocean-view rooms in that tower actually have really good views, you get the city and the harbor, beautiful. Bathrooms are pretty standard. I have always been treated well here. One year I was able to get a late check-out because my daughter fell asleep. The next year they couldn't because they already had the room booked, but they held our bags at the bell desk all day and when we returned from our day at the beach, they offered us 30 minutes in a Kona tower room where we were able to shower and change for our flight back. super nice.also, we never drive in honolulu (ugh!). i grew up in a big city so i am very comfortable with public transportation, and honolulu has a great transit system. the ala moana center is central for probably half the bus lines on the island, so being right next door is very convenient for getting around the island. if you want to really experience the daily flavor of oahu, nothing like hitting the bus system, i promise you.i really like ala moana and look forward to my trip there every summer!",big island HI,"ursulaBI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>big island HI</strong>",0,4.0

Although the Ala Moana Hotel is clearly an older structure from the 1970s, it was renovated relatively recently with a lovely contemporary design. The room was tastefully decorated, very quiet, and clean, with a decent mountain-side view, and the bed was pleasant and comfortable. Air conditioning quality is average (the unit could be a little quieter) but tolerable. The third-floor pool is mid-sized but still relatively good for a rooftop-type pool (9 feet deep at the deep end). The location next to Ala Moana Center and the nearby beach park is convenient, since it means one can enjoy great sightseeing, shopping, and dining without having to get in the rental car and sit in Honolulu's notoriously bad traffic. Now, the downsides, which is what we all read TripAdvisor for. The hotel is adjacent to the shopping center (and is connected by a skybridge) but is not directly adjacent to the beach park; you have to walk about half a mile to the beach. The rooms are rather small by American standards and have full rather than queen beds. It is possible to book a group of four into one room, as we did, but it will feel cramped. However, a couple or a single traveler would find the room size fine. The hotel charges for parking like most Honolulu hotels, although one would expect the daily rate to be a bit cheaper since it's not located in Waikiki per se. The third-floor pool is nice if you want privacy (relative to the the beachfront resorts in Waikiki where tourists wander through the pool areas), but inconvenient if you're the type who likes to go back and forth between pool and ocean. Finally, the good and bad thing is that the Ala Moana Hotel is not in Waikiki. So you don't have the crime, noise, and traffic of Waikiki, but it also means that if you want to go hang out at all the cool places in Waikiki, you have to get in the rental car, ride TheBus, or walk east over a mile in the sweltering tropical humidity.","San Mateo, California","coolcaesar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Mateo, California</strong>",75,4.0

Staying there was just great. We really paid less because we weren't in the heart of Waikiki, and for that we also got a very modern & refurbished hotel room - something quite hard to come by in Honolulu at the affordable price so it seems. Also the pros of staying here was probably that it was not as busy as other hotels would've been, with less traffic & noise about.We had a mountain view room. It was clean, it was comfortable.2 things I didn't like - shower curtain - bad luck, I'll get over it! (as opposed to shower screen). also the pillows - too puffy, high and soft. I prefer a firmer pillow. It was really hard to get comfy. After the 1st night I called reception and asked if they had different ones. They said no, they're all the same. I ended up using the pillows from the sofa couch which were a bit firmer, but smaller. Maybe next time I can bring my own.That night we didn't want to even make an effort to find a restaurant to eat at for dinner. We remembered we saw Domino's pizza on the way in, so we called to have a pizza each delivered to our room. $40 for 2 regular pizzas! When I said ""What?!"" Thinking that I mis-heard, the guy said ok i'll make it cheaper. I said Oh why so much? He said because you have extra toppings! (Standard we thought...) But anyway, we got the pizzas for $28 after that LOL.Most people said it would be too far to walk from Ala Moana, especially with the warmer weather conditions, but we walked it every time. The weather was completely bareable, and we're not even fit people.We ended up at Ala Moana shopping every night, wheather it be for more goods or just for dinner. I highly recommend it if you are into shopping. Being from Australia and travelling at 95c, we sure did make the most of cheaper levis, guess and armani.Because we'd spent so much, we didn't really want to go downtown for restaurant dinners, therefore had the luxury of buying food from Ala Moana food court.

I know this story sounds bad, but things like this can happen anywhere, and doesn't necessarily mean its a bad place. The manager responded appropriately, and to my satisfaction.The hotel is just a couple of blocks from the Convention Center, and right next-door to the Ala Moana Mall. The Mall is definitely the place to get meals and for shopping. Also, the hotel is a block away from Ala Moana Park (and beautiful public beach), about a 15-minute walk from the Hilton Hawaiian Villages, and about 25 minutes walk from Waikiki beach. Honolulu is an expensive place. Food costs about 150% the mainland price. You have to pay a fee for almost everything, though the in-room internet at this hotel is complimentary, and runs from hard-wired routers. This is not the case at the Hilton Hawaiian Villages, where internet runs $15.00 per day. But, if you want to print-out your boarding pass at the Ala Moana, you have to fork over 30 cents a minute to use the business center. Because their printer was not working when I was here, I asked someone at reception if they would print out my boarding passes. She said ""no"". Several hours later, I asked a different person at reception the same question, and she did it cheerfully. In Honolulu, ABC stores are a good source of supplies at OK prices - a single can of beer only costs about $1.60 there, while you will pay around $6.50 for a glass of beer in a hotel bar.

It's a relief not having to stay right in the middle of Waikiki which resembles some of the not so interesting parts of touristy places in the Mediterranean or in the Canaries. Taking the beach walk is perfect. Getting on The Bus is also very convenient from the Ocean side of the Ala Moana Center and it's The way to go around the town, to Pearl Harbour etc.The hotel staff is efficient and we had no problems with housekeeping. I'd have liked the pool to be open after sunset. The gym is open until 10 PM though. The Ala Moana Center is OK but for a European it is a weird experience to have to cross a wide parking deck no matter where you try to enter it on foot.

It's not perfect, but you really can't beat the location or the price. The hotel itself is not beach front, but the Ala Moana beach park is an easy walk. The shopping center is incredibly convenient and has lots of great food options, and Waikiki is only a $8 cab ride away. Also, the fitness center is very nice and rooms come with free high speed internet.The down side is that the rooms are pretty basic and housekeeping is hit or miss. I get the feeling that the cleaning is pretty superficial. The service is fine although not extraordinary, and the food in most of the restaurants is acceptable. Room service is limited. However, for $120-150 in the middle of a big city, let alone in a vacation destination like Hawaii, I really don't think you can beat it.","Boulder, CO","mc005i</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, CO</strong>",15,5.0

Other reviewers mentioned far walk to Waikiki but we found a short cut. Cut thru the Hilton Hawaiian and follow the beach walk along the shore line until you pass the pink hotel.

The good things - * Clean room, I had a balcony with a bit of ocean view. The room was a good size, with 2 double beds, 2 chairs, work desk.* Easy access to Ala Moana, which has many options for quick food and several nicer restaurants.* Ala Moana is a huge shopping center, and many people specifically come to Honolulu to shop there. So if shopping is on your list of things to do, this location cannot be beaten.* Only a couple of blocks to Ala Moana Beach Park. This park is mostly frequently by locals. It is very protected, great for swimming (but no snorkeling or surfing). Paddle surfing lessons are held here. There are big grassy areas and during the day people are playing ball, running with kids, etc. Overall it's a nice park and beach area, and less crowded/touristy than Waikiki.* Fridge and coffeemaker in the room mean I can eat breakfast in room inexpensively. They will bring a microwave on request.* The fitness center is better equipped than average!Problems (generally minor) - * Room service menu is very limited, only 6-9pm. I often get room service breakfast on the first morning of a business trip. If you like to eat breakfast in-room, you need to plan to get something and store it in your room. This is easy enough - there is an ABC Suprette a couple of blocks to the east, and another ABC store in the mall. * Pool is quite small. For swimming, I'd simply go to the beach.* Long-ish walk to Waikiki. If you want to rent a kayak or surfboard, or do any of the activities out of Waikiki you need to get there or arrange a tour with a shuttle. Many people grab towels from the pool at this hotel and then take a taxi or the trolley to Waikiki. It isn't that hard to do, but if you had really little kids it would be a pain.Bottom line:If you're looking for a less-expensive hotel, are traveling adults-only or with older kids, and shopping is on your to-do list, then is a good choice. If you have little kids and/or want to only spend time at the beach, this isn't a good choice.","San Mateo, California","JoKnits</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Mateo, California</strong>",119,4.0

If you like the convenience of almost everything and be away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, then this is the best place to be. Service was very good from the moment we checked to the day we checked out. It was a nice surprise to be upgraded from a small room at the Kona tower to a bigger room in the Waikiki tower. If you rent a car, it's $15/ day for self park and $20/ day for valet. Our breakfast buffet was included in our room rate which I think is very reasonable price compared to eating out. Buffet had large selections from french toasts, bagels, rice, omelets, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee, juice and fruits. The only down side is their internet connection, we had problems connecting to their high speed internet service but was given a discount due to this. Our rooms were cleaned on a daily basis before noon and given fresh towels as well. No noise heard if you close your lanai door.

In a nutshell, the pros: adjacent to the mall, close to Ala Moana Beach Park, fairly close to downtown, helpful/friendly staff, GREAT fitness center, and coin-op laundry on two floors. The cons: my room looked out over parking lots and buildings (no greenery whatsoever), noise from bars on the top level of Ala Moana Center could be heard at night, and the room was kind of dated (small tv, polyester bedspread).To expand futher.... my stay seemed fine at first, but got depressing after about a week. I had a room on a high floor with a view. I could see the ocean if I stood on the balcony. However, when in the room looking out, all I could see was buildings and pavement. In addition, my room had line-of-sight to the top level of Ala Moana Center, so I could hear the noise from the live band(s) at night, even over the air conditioning. Also, the room seemed like it could use an upgrade – for instance switching from the slippery polyester bed spreads to washable cotton.Laundry: There are laundry rooms on the 13th and 6th floors, which is a nice amenity. The 13th floor laundry stays open til midnight and 6th floor laundry is open 24/7. The coin changer is on the 13th floor. The machines take quarters only. There are 2 washers and 2 dryers on the 6th floor and 5 washers (including one high-efficiency machine that holds 1.5 loads) and 5 dryers on the 13th floor. The cost was $2.25 per wash (or $2.75 for the high-efficiency machine that included a digital count-down timer – 38 minutes for a wash), $2.25 per dry, and $1.25 for detergent (only the powdered type was available). The Foodland grocery store in the Ala Moana Center sells a small container of “All” laundry detergent for $4.29 that lasts for 8 loads of wash. There was nothing resembling a clothesline in my room, not even over the tub, so I relied on a combination of the dryer and hanging items on the hangers. Eight “real” hangers were provided in the closet.The Bus: You can easily take the bus from Ala Moana Center to Waikiki. There also is easy access to downtown (i.e. Bishop/King street vicinity). In spite of where the hotel told me to go, I found that the best bus stop was out the side door, and across the street (under the various ramps). Most of the buses stopping there turn and head downtown. The 57 in particular seemed pretty fast (for downtown, not Waikiki). The #8, 19 and 20 continue to Waikiki, so don’t get on those unless that’s where you are headed. Verify with the bus driver that you’re getting on the right bus.Tip of the day: The little refrigerator in the room does a pretty good job, but don’t expect miracles. I found out the hard way that one should not put a large quantity of warm sticky rice with chicken in the fridge and expect it to be safe to eat the next day. The fridge just can’t cool it down fast enough and food poisoning can ensue. The fridge was fine for things like yoghurt, cheese, cold cuts, etc., just not large quantities of hot food.","Seattle, Washington","Carrie_in_Seattle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",79,3.0

We had read the reviews online and decided the Ala Moana was the best fit with what we wanted to do.We booked via the internet - a very smooth process. We had one minor bug - we never got a confirmation e-mail. We did confirm the reservation by phone before departure. No worries...the phone lasted longer than expected. The staff person was concerned that we were arriving after the restaurant closed and wanted to make sure we didn't go to bed hungry! She also made sure we knew where to catch the shuttle bus.Thanks to weather delays we ended up arriving after midnight. One bonus we hadn't thought of when booking was this hotel is the first stop for the airport shuttle - less than 25 minutes away. For some of the Waikiki Hotels it can be well over an hour. If we were younger we probably hit the nightclub when we arrived. It was obviously a favorite with locals. As it was we appreciated the professional staff on the front desk. Check in was smooth and quick.The room had everything we wanted - microwave, fridge and in room safe. We had a great view of Ala Moana Park from the lanai, and enjoyed having our morning coffee out there. The bed was very good. I didn't wake up feeling like an old crock with a sore back - a rare event for me at a hotel.The location is great. The shopping center next door has everything. Ala Moana park is not anywhere close to being crowded, unlike the main beach a Waikiki. If you really need to, Waikiki beach is within walking distance. Honolulu has a good bus system, and nearly every route connects at the shopping center. Makes it very easy to live without a rental car.We only had the buffet breakfast at the hotel.

Big plus is its location - it's fairly easy access to H1 and just around the corner from Ala Moana/Nimitz. For those who need to be near a mall, Ala Moana mall is right next door and is accessible through a second floor bridge. It's easy to get to Ala Moana park, too.The room is clean and contemporary, but teeny tiny. The bed linens are ""sanitized"" according to a little sign under the glass top of the bedside table - yeah, I wasn't too worried in a place like this (or am I just being naive?). The bathroom is also quite small but clean. I did have to request a change of the shower curtain liner, as the first one just reeked of mildew and I couldn't take it any more. Oh, and the rooms aren't Wifi, which I *hate.* The lobby is apparently wired for it, but I just don't see the point.The pool area is pleasant, although traffic noise is inescapable.

It's also a lot better than many of the shady non-resort places in Waikiki.Good: It's a great value, and is ""attached"" (sort of) to an enormous shopping and dining complex. There's trolley service to Waikiki for $2 each way, which beats the pants off trying to find parking. Ala Moana Beach Park is right across the street.Our room was pretty well equipped, and came with a refrigerator and microwave. Parking is $15 a night (as of September 2008) in the hotel garage - lower than most places in town.Bad: The parking garage that connects the hotel to the shopping mall can be kind of shady at night. My wife and I were approach by vagrants several times.The walk to Waikiki is a little bit longer than it looks on a map - it was about a 30 minute walk for two reasonably in-shape people. But, if you aren't absolutely set on staying in Waikiki it's not that big a deal and (as above) there is a trolley service.Pool is tiny with not much shade. The rooms (at least in the Kona tower) are also a little on the small side.

If you want to stay in the heart of Waikiki..then don't stay here. But it's only a short bus/taxi ride away. It was nice not to be knee deep in tourists and the beach at Ala Moana Park across the street was a 3-4 minute walk. A lot of locals checked into the hotel on the 4th because it is so close to where the fireworks would be. We probably could have watched the fireworks from our room, but we chose to hang with the locals and enjoy the show up close. The fireworks were breathtaking and was 20 minutes long. (We've seen the fireworks in Sydney as well..and it gave them a run for their money.)The staff at the hotel was EXTREMELY friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone from the parking attendants, to the bell desk, to the concierge (who printed directions for us) made us feel welcome. My mom sent us some goodies through room service and the hotel even followed up and called my mom to let her know they had been sent.One sort of cheesy thing was the club downstairs (""Rumors"") seemed to have a ""Sweet 16"" party of some sort every night. Definitely a non-issue for us but may not be something someone wishes to encounter when relaxing on vacation.On the plus side, the hotel is adjacent to a FANTASTIC shopping center which has EVERYTHING. So finding food or picking up those random things you forgot is not a problem.While we didn't check out the pool from our balcony view we could see it was always pretty packed.Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay and would consider staying there again.","Cerritos, California","JaxAnn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cerritos, California</strong>",11,4.0

It was fine for what it was. Check-in also took a long time - there were only two people working at the reception (though there were spaces for 8) but it went smoothly once we got to the front. The rooms were very small - barely enough room for us to lay our suitcases down and to still be able to walk around the room. This meant it was also crowded when we were trying to get ready in the morning. We also booked a ""mountain-view"" which we were barely able to see through the other hotels that bordered ours. On a happier note, the sheets/bed were very comfortable and its location next to the Ala Moana mall was greatly appreciated when we arrived and were very hungry!! It was late so not much else was open, but we did enjoy a great meal at one of the mall restaurants. The cost of the breakfast buffet was a bit outrageous. Be warned - its $16.99 per person. This is not posted anywhere so make sure you are willing to spend this much before you sit down! We found out the hard way. Since parking was $15 for 24 hours, who would have guessed that it was more than that for one of us to eat? Yikes!",Boston,"Ciaobella37</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston</strong>",16,3.0

When I contacted the hotel about the charge, the assistant manager said that the carpet in the room we stayed in was damaged with cigarette burns, which is bizarre since none of us smoke. When I spoke to the General Manager later that day, he told me that he did not know what the burns were from but were large scorch marks...so now I have been told two different things. I had him email me the pictures, which showed four small round stains that my children remembered seeing when we arrived and thought were dirt marks. We can't believe that they are charging us $600 for their dirty carpets. BEWARE!!!! Have a hotel employee do a walk through when you check in so you are not slapped with a bogus charge.

In retrospect, I can’t decide if I’m sorry about that or not. We found the hotel to be adequate overall, but it’s certainly nothing we would have chosen for ourselves. The location next to the Ala Moana Shopping Center is ideal for those who want to shop, and it was about a 15 minute amble to the water’s edge of the Ala Moana Park. Our room, #757 in the Kona Tower, was tiny but nicely appointed with a queen bed, pull-out sofa, and a flat screen TV which we never turned on. Our immediate view was of the parking garage for the mall, with the marina and then the ocean beyond that. There was a sliding glass door but no balcony—excuse me, lanai—to speak of. The temperature control was an old-fashioned variety so that the fan could be hot or cold, on or off, and it was always humid in the room. We either froze with the fan on all night or suffocated with it off. By the time we checked out any clothing that had been left out in the room was noticeably damp. The complimentary high-speed internet was a joke. The one time we were able to get a connection, it took entire minutes to load the homepage. We waited so long for our email to download that we left it while we went to dinner but the connection timed out before we returned. Wi-Fi was available, but for a charge! In a business/convention hotel! Based on the rate we paid our last night, $149/night plus taxes, I’d say this place was an okay value.","North Attleboro, Massachusetts","ejcrowe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Attleboro, Massachusetts</strong>",294,3.0

Since we stayed in a condo this review will be on the Hotel itself not the rooms.Our main purpose in going to Hawaii was fun on the beach & in the ocean.If that's your purpose this is NOT the best hotel for you. The beach at ALA Moana Park is QUITE a hike & then there are very few waves. It was too calm for us. We ended up taking a cab down to Waikiki when we were ready to swim each day.It is connected to the Ala Moana mall which made shopping & eating very convenient. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. The elevators seemed to move fairly quickly so there was never much of a wait for one. Looks like they have done a recent renovation there so the lobby & hallways appeared nice not worn at all.So bottom line if you are there for meetings at the Convention Center this hotel should do you just fine. If you are interested in fun in the sun or nightlife move on down to Waikiki.,"Indianapolis, Indiana","dbgindy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indianapolis, Indiana</strong>",14,3.0

For two nights we did not need them anyway.Great view of city lights at night and water/marina in the day. Very quiet at nigt due to good soundproofing.King bed was loveley and we had 2 balconies.

Late at night, when I checked in, the lobby was horrendously lit with fluorescent lights and bad music was blaring from the nightclub just off reception...it was a pretty disconcerting way to be greeted after travelling for 12 hours. As well, the people I dealt with when I checked in were completely vacant and focused more on each other than on dealing with me...very bizarre...and when I went back down with all my stuff because the key wasn't working, they didn't say anything to me, but just joked to one another, ""I've been having some trouble making keys today."" No ""sorry about that"" or anything. I don't much care about stuff like this, usually, but I was pretty irritated.I found it little dingy, in parts - the carpets in the hallway and the room are really stained, as was the little loveseat in my room. Pretty gross. Otherwise, the room was fine. Functional. What I found strange was the lack of amenities for such an enormous hotel. There was not a crumb of food to be found when I arrived there at 11pm on a Sunday night. I hadn't eaten for way too long, and was starving - but was directed to the 7-11. Weird. I also find it odd that in such a large hotel, there's no coffee/pastries place...there's nowhere to go to just grab a quick coffee/tea and pastry, for instance - you have to do the whole sit-down breakfast buffet.

We were visiting family and they selected the hotel, I would have picked something else. The view out to the city and beach was nice. There are no activities per se at the hotel and the pool is just a regular roof top pool that is not little kid friendly. The proximity to the Ala Moana shopping center is great. It is near Ala Moana beach park (which is a great and very calm beach) but it is about a 15 minute walk over there. The service was slow at times and snappy at others. Between the king bed, fold out couch and crib we were very cramped. The vanity is in the bathroom itself (which is a bit small) so showering and getting everyone ready at the same time was a challenge. While the hotel was recently renovated and very modern the a/c unit was one of the old fashioned kind where it is either freezing or off. Plus, there is no comforter (just a very, very thin coverlet) so between 2 sheets and a light blanket it was at times uncomfortable. There is a fridge but we were missing the microwave. The hotel was a bit hit or miss. The location can't be beat for business travelers or ardent shoppers but it just wasn't the hotel for us.","Houston, Texas","VWoo8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",102,3.0
