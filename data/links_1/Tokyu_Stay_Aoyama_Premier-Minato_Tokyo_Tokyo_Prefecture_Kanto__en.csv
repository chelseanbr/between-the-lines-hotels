It's not at a Yamanote line station, but you can get around really good with the Ginza Line (and Shibuya is only two stops away). The neighbourhood it's located in is really nice and you can walk to Harajuku in 10-15 minutes.The view from our room (we stayed in the 25th floor) was excellent! You get really spoiled going to bed with the whole city in front of you.The beds are really comfortable. The pillows are ok, but after a day in Tokyo you should be able to sleep well anyways. You have lots of restaurants within minutes from the hotel. Right next to the hotell there is a French place called Citron that's really good for breakfast, lunch and a light dinner and just around the corner you have three convenient stores (one of them is open 24hrs). Cleaning was excellent, really nice!Not so good:You can easily hear people in the hall. Not that it happened that much, but worst case, you hear drunk people talking away in the middle of the night when they get home after a night out. You should be fine if you're a deep sleeper, but I got woken up a lot thanks to this. Same goes for sounds from outside. Again, doesn't happen a lot, but firetrucks, police etc are easy to hear when the alarm goes off. The bathroom has everything you need, shower has great water pressure etc, but its the average plastic cubicle you find in most Japanese non-five star hotels. Overall: I'd definitely stay here again; the price, location, view and the fact that you have a kitchenette and washing machine (that's really easy to use and has a built in dryer) makes all the difference. The room was fairly big in comparison with other hotel rooms we've stayed in, so that was nice too.

Everything you need is just minutes away. Close to Gaienmae station, and in walking distance to Omotesando or Shibuya. The hotel is undergoing a renovation process, some rooms do look tired, so this does not come too early. However, during my stay there was disruption due to this, especially no noise. As this hotel caters to individuals and not tour groups it is usually really quiet. Rooms are small and there is no closet or even space to open a big suitcase flat on the floor-but then again this is Tokyo. What I love is the big window-it gives a feeling of space. The mini-kitchen including fridge is great and if you stay for a bit longer there is even a washing machine. The staff is friendly but they do not have any kind of customer loyalty programme or even recognizing it when you are coming back the 20th time...In conclusion: location, the big window and small kitchen make all the difference for me.

During both stays, Tokyo has experienced heavy rains due to passing typhoons. I'm not sure the hotel wants me back!I like staying at this hotel, although I have to say I am very disappointed at the service I experienced during this stay. Otherwise, the hotel has a lot to offer. In my opinion, the location is GREAT. Right outside the door are plenty of dining options,and great shopping is not far distant. Omotesando is definitely walkable, and if you are up to it, so is Shibuya. Roppongi is perhaps a bit of a further walk but doable. Jingu Stadium is a ten minute walk. I also like that this hotel has in room combination washer / dryers. This hotel was one of the first in this price range that I am aware of to offer in room wi-fi, and it works well / fast. Breakfast was included in my room rate in 2013, but this time cost 1200 yen. Breakfast is in a third party establishment in the same building. Choices are acceptable and sufficient, but not up to the number of choices at other Japanese hotels at which I have stayed. Rooms are small, but reasonably efficiently laid out. Before booking, check the hotel website for room options - there are a wide range of choices.Towels are thin, thin, thin. Cheap thin. Also worth noting: If you turn off the air conditioning, you can hear a lot of exterior traffic noise, including what I believe are passing trains on the underground Ginza Line. However, my main beef with this stay was with the service. I was at the hotel two nights during this stay. The day between the two nights was rainy all day. I was out of the hotel from about 10 am to 12:30 pm, but my room was not cleaned until close to 3:00 pm. The young man who cleaned my room was clearly not happy I was in the room and kept pushing the desk chair in which I was sitting and my things around. Yes, I realize it would have been easier for him if I was not in the room, and yes I realize the room is small. But I am the customer. Without customers, he doesn't have a job.The other service disappointment was asking for delayed checkout. I was switching hotels in Tokyo to join a tour group and could not check in to the other hotel until 3 pm. Check out at the Tokyu Stay Aoyama Premier was 11:00 am. Again, the day featured hard rain. Respecting that the hotel needed to clean rooms for incoming guests, I asked only for a noon departure. I don't know if there was a language barrier or what, but the response by the front desk clerk was to point to 11:00 am on his watch. This hotel has a lot to offer in terms of location and in room amenities for the price range. However, with the service I experienced this time, I will at least explore other options if returning to Tokyo.","Cypress, Texas","jbtexas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cypress, Texas</strong>",253,4.0

We chose it for its proximity to a wedding we were attending. Personally, I thought there was very little to distinguish this hotel from multitudes of other Tokyo hotels. Tokyo hotels I have stayed in have all been small (you have to jump over your luggage to get out the door). This one does have a laundry machine INSIDE the room however, which was a new experience for me. We did not end up using it, because we stayed only one night, but that could be very convenient for some travelers and deserves a recommmendation. Traveling with a baby especially, we saw the value of this. I take away one star from my rating however because, due to our flight arrival time, we needed to check in around 630am. For this, we were charged one whole extra nights stay. Previously, we stayed at a different Tokyo hotel (Hotel Wing Ikebukuro) and were able to check in early with no extra fee. I think in a city like Tokyo, with so many international arrivals, it would be helpful to travelers to have a less strict check-in policy. Additionally, the lobby staff told us upon check-in that the room cleaning time was at 2pm, and asked us if that was OK. We just stared dumbfounded and requested to skip the ""cleaning"" of the room which we had not even spent the night in yet.In addition to the laundry machine in the room, the hotel boasts some kind of kitchenette, which is basically a microwave, sink, and some assorted utensils. This came handy for us in cleaning baby bottles, but i don't imagine cooking a meal in there, and the hotel rules beg guests not to use ""excessive oil"" when cooking food in the rooms. Fortunately, during our stay, we did not detect the smell of frying foods anywhere in the hotel.The neighborhood is very walkable, with restaurants, a Starbucks, and several supermarkets and convenience stores nearby. The shower had good water pressure and felt refreshing. The rooms are quiet and clean.For 1100yen/person, there was a cafe on the 2nd Floor offering a nice breakfast buffet of salad, ham, salmon, rice, pastry, juice, and coffee that was very convenient.

I've been curious about the Tokyu Stay hotels since they seemed to be spacious by Japanese standards and were moderately-priced as well as being in a good location. I was choosing between Aoyama Premier and the Yotsuya one, but in the end chose this one. We got a twin room on the 24th floor which we found quite roomy. The closet was small but we didn't have a lot with us so it was no problem. The bathroom was a little small but very clean with an automated toilet and lots of toiletries which were replenished daily. There was a washing machine and dryer and a cooking plate (didn't use those) and a refrigerator which we filled up with our own snacks and drinks. The beds were comfortable and my mom was able to sleep most of her jet lag off, which was a good thing. The only problem we had with the room was the remote control for the airconditioning - it really took time to adjust the temperature to the desired function and setting. It was either a bit too warm or freezing cold. We had to ask the staff to check it and change the battery of the remote control, but after that it seemed to work fine.Breakfast was at Lanikai Cafe on the second floor, for 1200 yen per person. It was not lavish by any means but it was complete and gave us a good start to our day. We also tried the Indian restaurant Ahilya in the row of restaurants downstairs, which was also good. All in all we were very satisfied and are looking forward to coming back.TIP: There are two 24-hour supermarkets within a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel (Aoyama Peacock and Seijo Ishii) where you can pick up prepared meals, snacks, drinks and anything else you need. We just loved this fact about the hotel. There's also a Starbucks and a Subway on the way to Gaien-mae Station, as well as a convenience store.","Tokyo, Japan","Jenina d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",55,4.0

I never thought once that I was cramped or claustrophobic. I had room for my laptop and other daily use stuff, books and whatnot. There were chargers everywhere (nice for tech junkies like me) and as long as they are the two prong (non-grounded) you'll be totally fine. The TV was, I'd say, a 32"" Toshiba and looked fairly new. The aircon (AC/heating unit) never made me feel cold, hot, stuffy, or damp... it was a Thanksgiving and Christmas miracle! The bathrooms were very clean and the bathtub was very nice to sit in; even me being 6'4 was no issue whatsoever. The room had a kitchen with a hotplate, fridge, denshi range, sink, and cabinets with little pots and pans but I never used them. The location in Aoyama 3 chome was PERFECT for me. It is right next to a supermarket as well as a FamilyMart convenience store. I personally don't enjoy being crowded (Look for my review on the Shibuya Tokyu Stay Excel Hotel) so this location was perfect for me, plus it is only about a 5 minute walk from my office. The staff was very friendly and I'm not sure if they spoke English or not, I try to stick to Japanese just to speed things up a little bit.Let's talk about the things I am not sure some people would like:Their breakfast buffet. I personally loved it. But I will tell you this, it is very very Japanese. They have a nice little salad bar with a good selection of breads and potato salads... then there is the main course. It is really based around a few things: Scrambled eggs (Japanese style is more runny than US kind), rice, grilled or poached salmon or mackerel, natto, miso soup, konnyaku or some type of other traditionally boiled Japanese vegetables or roots, a full selection of delicious juices - literally ANY kind of liquid you would ever think of drinking in the morning, and typically some sort of other specialty from a foreign country (it changed each week from things like pilaf to okonomiyaki to something from Sweden). I love Japanese food so I never thought anything of it but I did watch the faces of other foreigners as they took the plastic cover of a cup of natto and that always made me laugh.I strongly recommend this hotel!","Lehi, Utah","scottc675</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lehi, Utah</strong>",3,5.0

The hotel placed us in adjoining rooms so we had privacy but still felt secure knowing we were separated by a wall. The room was not large but enough space to move around in. This single room is definitely meant for one person only.The bed was excellent for a single bed, it was larger than a super single, and was very firm.It is amazing how many amenities were packed into this little room.

Many power points for these amenities and I can use them as well as charge my phone at the same time. There is another powerpoint near the bed for extra gadgets.

However, there are a few aspects of the hotel that merit consideration before booking. Starting with the positives. The rate I was able to obtain through a third party booking site for a single room in a great Tokyo neighborhood was phenomenal. That one can book a hotel room in the Aoyama district of Tokyo with FREE in-room wi-fi, breakfast included in the room rate, and with a washing machine (includes a drying cycle, so no need for a separate dryer) with nominally priced detergent available at the front desk), and a microwave and refrigerator for less than $125 US per night is amazing. Adding to this is that the wi-fi is very simple to set up and is very stable and sufficiently fast. There is also an in-room safe, and body wash, shampoo, conditioner and hand soap are provided as well. The only negatives on the in-room amenities are that the towels are thin and the toilet paper is not ""top of the line."" I was in room 2010 and had some road noise, but nothing out of the ordinary. The hotel is near a busy intersection and whenever an ambulance went through, they used a loud speaker to warn cross traffic (great idea, by the way) and that was audible from the room. There are English language instruction pages for the washing machine, the safe and the air conditioner remote control (which you will need, if you are not familiar with typical Japanese hotel a/c set ups). The other overwhelming positive was the neighborhood around the hotel. Excellent choice of dining in all cuisines. There are several restaurants in the Aoyama Passage at the foot of the hotel. I found a Britsh Pub on the road to Meiji Jingu Stadium (less than 10 minute walk from the hotel). There are two Starbucks within five minutes of the hotel, and three more on the walk to Shibuya Station (not to mention the world's busiest Starbucks at Hachinko Crossing outside Shibuya Station). There is a Family Mart around the corner and a 7-11 across Aoyama Dori. There is also easy access to the Gaiemmae Station (G-03) on the Ginza Line. More on that below.Two aspects that I would consider positive but not to the same degree as above. I found the hotel staff to be helpful and polite (and English speaking) but the overall level of common area amenities was sparse (one vending machine, hidden just off the check in lobby on the 13th floor). One pays for one's stay at check-in. Breakfast is in the Architect Cafe in the same building on the second floor (so outside of the hotel area which is floors 13-25). At check in, one is given coupons for breakfast, otherwise the charge is 1,200 yen. Note, bring the coupon with you. Your room card / your room number means zip / zilch / nada to the Cafe crew. The cafe has sufficient seating, but is overall a bit cramped (not a lot of ""personal space""). The selection of food is OK, but may feel limited to those with western preferences. There is a good selection of beverages, including - for breakast - iced black tea, iced oolong tea, and iced coffee. Of the three differenent hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo over the years, while the this hotel is the least expensive, the breakfast is also the most limited. Of course, it is included in the room rate.The one negative is the size of the room. Single A guest rooms are described on the hotel's website as 17 m2. That is about 185 square feet. There is no room to spare and the room felt cramped. It rained hard on September 15 in the morning and then Typhoon TS 1318 passed over on the 16th, and I was most glad to be able to get out of the room when the weather cleared in the afternoon both days. A few suggestions / observations for guests planning on booking a stay.1) The hotel has an excellent website. Search for ""Tokyu Stay Aoyama Premier"" and you should easily find a link to an English language version of the hotel's website. Check this out before booking.2) The hotel is intended as an ""extended stay"" hotel. If you are staying more than six nights, be sure you understand the hotel's room servicing policies.3) The hotel is the tallest building in the neighborhood, and the elevator lobbies have good views of the Shinjuku highrise district and rooms xx07-xx16 (at least that is the case on the 20th floor) have views of Mt. Fuji and the hills west of Tokyo on clear days. I would imagine the views of central Tokyo from east facing rooms are equally good.4) This hotel has very easy access to the Gaiemmae station (G-03) on the Ginza Line. Enter and exit via Gate 1A and you will be within a two - three minute walk of the hotel entrance. I have been in Tokyo previously, and had tried (wisely) to avoid Tokyo subways at peak hours. I did not have a choice this time on two occasions and misjudged the end of morning rush hour on another occasion. The Ginza Line gets quite crowded at peak hours - and that is an understatement. The most crowded stretch is between stops G-05 (Akasaka - Mitsuke) and G-08 (Shimbashi). However, crowding can extend all the way to Shibuya (G-01) through Nihombashi (G-11). Just be forewarned, because unless you are willing to walk a bit, your ""first kilometre"" and ""last kilometre"" of public transit access to and from this hotel are going to be on the Ginza Line. Also, Gaiemmae is the station for the Yakult Swallows stadium and the national rugby stadium. I did not use the station during peak crowd arrival or departure times, but I imagine it can get hectic. Otherwise, I found it a fairly quiet, easy to navigate station. Overall, I think this is a great value in Tokyo lodging with a lot of positives. But do consider room sizes, servicing on longer stays and the subway access before booking.","Cypress, Texas","jbtexas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cypress, Texas</strong>",253,4.0

While the 1 hr. bus did no go directly to my hotel, I selected a bus that got me close (within 1.5 miles) and took a cab to my hotel. I purchased a ticket to the Excel? Hotel figuring that was closest to my hotel. It was the 3rd or 4th stop and it would have been better to get off at the Osio? Hotel (1st stop) and take a cab from there. That move would have saved 20-30 minutes as the bus dropped other off others at these hotels. The Tokyu Stay Aoyama Premier is a small hotel and the taxi driver had to enter the address in his GPS to find it.The lobby for the hotel is on the 12th floor and rooms are above that floor. I did not need help with getting bags to my room, and there did not appear to be anyone to help if needed. The staff spoke very good English and they were very helpful. I received a breakfast coupon for each night that allowed me to eat each morning at a small restaurant on the 2nd floor. The food was mostly Japanese with some western food and the restaurant staff was very helpful. Unfortunately there was no coffee only tea, so a quick trip around the corner to Starbucks was needed. I never felt unsafe walking around.The room was very “efficient” and typical for many Tokyo hotels. The main room was 8’ x 8’ wall to wall. There was ~2’ of floor at the end of the bed about ~3’ on the side. The fire escape map confirmed that all rooms on that floor (21st) were the same size. I did have a view of Mt. Fuji one morning, but most of the time it was hidden by clouds (smog?). The bed was very firm and the pillows were also stiff/firm. There were no drawers to use for unpacking your bag. The small slot (6” wide) to hang up clothes could only fit 3 hangers. There was a microwave, very small frig and washing machine in the room. The hotel was very quiet and I didn’t hear any noises from the adjacent rooms. The lighting was controlled by buttons on the headboard and there was a nice “Night Light” that provided dim light to find the bathroom. There was a cut out in the headboard to hold your iPhone and a power outlet next to it if you use the phone as an alarm clock. The heated bathroom seat is typical for Tokyo. The tub walls were quite high and the hand held shower fit nicely into a high bracket for a typical US shower experience. The room had a good size personal safe that allowed me to lock up my laptop and other valuables. The free Wi-Fi was very strong and Skype to the US worked very smoothly. The AC unit is mounted above the headboard on the wall and worked fine once I found the English instructions in the book on the desk.The room was very clean, and I will go back to this hotel again.",Walnut Creek,"Kevin_WalnutCreek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walnut Creek</strong>",36,4.0

Good range of eating places close by, both Japanese and European. Try Eat on Kita-Aoyama for a cheap tasty burger. Lovely cake shop down stairs. Staff are pleasant and helpful.

The hotel lived up to my expectations. My conference was at the United Nations University which is closer to Shibuya but still walkable frorm this hotel - 15 mins brisk walk or 20 minutes at a relaxed pace. I chose the smaller configuration room (listed as 'A' on website - 17m square) and it was adequate for my needs as a single guest. If you have lots of luggage or plan to spend a lot of time at the hotel or you want to do in room work-outs, yoga or whatever then you would find this room cramped. But if you want to use this as a base for conferences, explore sites, go shopping, jogging etc and return to admire the view and rest then this hotel is well suited. You can walk to Meiji Shrine and surrounding park. I paid a small surchage for a room with a view and I could see Mt Fuji from my window, depending on cloud cover. Also, I was offered a discount for booking around 3 weeks in advance. The breakfast was fine. The room had a reverse cycle split system air con which worked well but took a few attempts to adjust the settings appropriate to my needs. The room was very quiet. The pillow was firm which suited me fine.There was a vent in the window sill to let in a bit of extra air and street sound if you like.

It's one of the prime jogging course in Japan. The rooms are small, but has everything you need. A free Wifi connection, a small fridge, a microwave, and a washer/dryer. A washer/dyer in each room!

Hotels can be expensive in Tokyo, and the rate I am charged at this hotel is quite low in comparison with others. The hotel is located in the Aoyama section of Tokyo near a number of restaurants and stores. It is a very nice area, and I enjoy walking around the neighborhood in the evening after work. The hotel is conveniently located just around the corner from the Gaiemmae Station on the Ginza Line (Stop G03). Getting from either Haneda or Narita Airports is fairly easy. Both airports have trains into the city with Metro connections. From there, it is a simple matter of getting on the Ginza Line.As for the room itself, it is small. This is Tokyo, and the rooms in this hotel are actually not small by Tokyo standards. Not that I want to spend all my time indoors watching TV, but the lack of channels in any language other than Japanese is a bit of a disappointment. They have CNN, but they often dub over the English with Japanese except at night. They have a way of ordering movies on the TV, but I was not interested and did not take the time to figure out how to do so.My stay included internet access and breakfast. Internet speed is good, but access is via ethernet cable in the rooms and wifi in the lobby. The rooms do not have wifi. The breakfast is a bit of a job just to be completely honest. The selection is poor and not particularly tasty.The rooms are clean, conveniently located, and are offered at a good price. If this is what you need, then this is the place for you.

Like other travelers have mentioned, the room is on the small side, but normal for Tokyo and comfortable for one. It has a small fridge with freezer, kettle, hot pad, and most importantly for a multi-week stay: a washer/dryer combo tucked by the door. Other hotels have seemingly larger rooms, but the floor space here is used for these extras that make a long stay away from home bearable. There are cubbies to store things everywhere.The staff speaks perfect English and goes out of their way to be helpful. They sell little things you might need in the room - like a pack of laundry detergent for 30 yen. The hotel is almost right on the Ginza line, which is an easy way to go most places in Tokyo. A word of warning - the Ginza line is PACKED during commute hours. This neighborhood is quiet for Tokyo: there's not that much in the area itself, but Omato-sando is only a 10-minute walk away. For the Americans here, the ATM at the post office right around the corner will be great to have, since most ATMs here don't take our credit cards. There's also a convenience store, grocery store, and at least 15 restaurants within a 3 minute walk. Like I said, quiet for Tokyo.Being the only high building on its block, you do get great views. One side of the hotel faces Mt. Fuji (in the distance, but pretty cool to see) and the other side faces the giant Oracle building, a cemetery, and the green spaces of a large park. On the ladies only floor, the rooms type B (larger rooms with kitchenette) face Oracle and gets the sunrise sun, type A face Mt. Fuji and I assume gets sunset sun in the room. The curtains are heavy but not blackout curtains. At night there's baseball games in the school field below, and it's fun to watch the little people run around. Weird thing about reservations: when you reserve on their web site they don't ask for your credit card. The web reservation system is a little convoluted, but it is in English. When you show up and check in, they charge you for your entire stay.Breakfast is decent and the little croissants are delish. I'm glad I read the other reviews and brought my own squishy pillow: they do have Japanese pillows here.

There are two local bus routs to Shibuya through now famous highends shopping district of Omotesando and Roppongi. The bus stop is right around the corner from the hotel. Although we can walk to Omotesando and Shibuya the bus service was handy. The hotel also is very close to Meiji Shrine, Takeshitacho, Meiji Outer Garden with the National track and field stadium (1964 Tokyo Olympic major stadium) and two baseball parks. Shinjuku and other areas are also easy to get to by transfer to other lines, The area is full of modern shops and restaurants. A super market Peacock is relatively next door. Also a post office where we can use ATM is very close.The hotel occupies the 13th where the lobby is to the top floor(26th?). The guests get to the necessary floors by using room cards on the elevator so it's very secure. Since it is relatively new the facility is very modern. My room on the 22nd foor was exclusively for ladies. The room is equipped with everything we need, a fridge, a microwave oven, a set of dishes, a trouser press and a washer-dryer combo. My room faced the West toward Aoyama and Shibuya. Mt. Fuji can be seen on fine days. From the hallway window we can see Shinjuku highrises and all the way to the right Tokyo's newest attraction ""Tokyo Sky Tree"" was visible. Fom the lobby we can see other directions including Tokyo Tower. The room is not large but it has a good size (Queen size) bed and it was big enough for me. The front desk staff was polite and helpful. They kept my luggage for a day without any fuss.My plan included breakfast which is served on the 2nd floor ""Architect Cafe""/ It is a combination of Japanese and Western style buffet but more on Japanese side.
