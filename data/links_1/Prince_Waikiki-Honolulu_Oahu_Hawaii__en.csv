The rooms are immaculate; clean, luxurious, with a wonderful bathroom en suite. The entire staff was friendly, gracious, and efficient. The nightly turn-down service made us feel so special. The pools and cabanas were more than expected and the lobby and shops within it were top notch. We opted for the ""club"" experience and were not disappointed.

What makes this hotel is the people there. From the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping, everybody was great and respectful. The only downside I had was it took a long time for my wife to get a menu while at the pool, but even the waitress there was respectful.The rooms themselves were good. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom were great. The washlets were new to me but I want to install one now at home because of the crazy TP shortage. The views from the wall to ceiling windows were breath taking. We had rooms directly across from the elevators and we didn’t notice any noise from the other guests at all. The carpets were a little worn however but that’s the only negative thing I saw with the room itself. We rented a Nissan Armada (pretty tall vehicle) while we were there and the parking garage was too small to comfortably park it. We were told to stay on the ground floor of the parking garage and had difficulty maneuvering it down there so I had valet park the time we were there. Which was ok as the valet parking price was only $8 extra per night and was worth it.Overall the people at the hotel made our experience there pleasurable. I can’t say enough about how I was treated by the people there.","Mahomet, Illinois","tonykitt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mahomet, Illinois</strong>",0,5.0

We had a room on the 30th floor and had an amazing view of the harbor, the beach that's a little farther away and some buildings. The staff was friendly and the room was nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom was relatively large and the water flow from the shower was excellent. The pool and whirlpool are located on the 5th floor. They aren't big so if it's high season I wouldn't recommend going to the pool nor whirlpool. I estimate that only 5 people could be in the whirlpool comfortably. When we were there however it was very quiet at the poolside so it was perfect.The service at the poolside is great, while the drinks and food up there are average. I would recommend the cabanas up at the front. They are big, private, and include a mini refrigerator. Just make sure you don't get the one that has no upper coverage, cause then you won't be able to hide from the sun.You will be able to see the Friday fireworks clearly from the poolside. Don't expect too much though; it's only a 5 minutes show.I also really liked the view inside the full glass elevator.Finally I find the location of this hotel to be excellent. It's not on Waikiki Beach itself, so it;s not crowded when you step outside, but it's close enough to it and close to many good restaurants and other places. You can walk to the Ala Moana shopping mall from there and within 2 minutes you can find for example an IHOP or a Red Lobster. There are also bus stops close by.All by all a great hotel that I would surely recommend. ",Curacao,"Altmar1801</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Curacao</strong>",2,4.0

So you can imagine we had high expectations. Location was good- away from the crowds and business of Waikiki beach and a nice walk from the hotel to the action. We booked the Club Lounge room and access. The Club Lounge was disappointing- very limited choices of food for breakfast - we didn't expect a buffet or anything but there were three options- one was Miso soup which we didn't eat. There was a an egg option sometimes eg scrambled but was always cold. We stopped going there for breakfast after three days. Also only one choice of white wine, and beer. .For the price we were paying this was poor value. This is not a cheap hotel so we expected more. We hired a cabana at the pool for half a day and included was water bottles sunscreen and two cocktails and a pizza- this was good value and the service was excellent. The room was fabulous big and stunning view of the ocean, sunsets and fireworks. It was cleaned beautifully. One other small issue was on our last day, we left the ""Do not disturb"" sign on our door by mistake when we went out so the room wasn't cleaned and housekeeping left a note.asking us to call when we wanted our room cleaned which was nice.. So I called and asked them not to worry about cleaning the room as we were checking out early the next morning, but could they bring us clean towels and take away the rubbish and a few dirty plates we had there. When we returned, we had new towels but the rubbish and plates were still there. They didn't leave us any water either which is included daily. So we had a early pick up to the airport at 4 15am so I get up and turn on a tap on-no water. Check shower-no water. So I ring front desk and they tell me there is scheduled maintenance on their water supply and there would be no water between 4 15-5 am! We had an 11 hour flight coming up and we weren't able to shower and we had received no notification.Let's just say we weren't happy. AS we were leaving our room to check out and doing a final check I found a piece of paper on the bench telling us about the water disruption. Was it left under the door and housekeeping picked it up and put it on the bench? We don't know but surely there should be some reliable way of letting guests know this? we had a wake up call booked- perhaps they could have mentioned it then to us when we ""Oh by the way are you aware that there is a disruption to the water in the morning?

A word to wise will apply to few people but is important. On holidays Honolulu has parades. The parades literally cut off the hotel driving to elsewhere including the airport. As such I missed my flight and it was a major inconvenience for my onward trip. Noticing the parade in the hotel newsletter I asked about it the night before and the desk clerk wrote out a “detour” which was wrong and useless. There is no detour. Why the hotel doesn’t have the common sense to slip a note under the door of those they know are planning to check out is dumbfounding. The note should say “you will not be able to drive cars from the hotel between 9 and 11AM” or whatever so please plan accordingly. The hotel did make right by me which is why I’m not rating lower but they should really know better how to help guests manage the situation since it surely happens all the time. Signs in elevators. In the parking garage. Under room doors. Fully trained desk clerks. ,"Cleveland, Ohio","ncflyer99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",27,4.0

Free welcome beverages too and for two! The room was clean, friendly staff, pool amazing! The hotel is surrounded with views of everything. The harbor, diamond head etc. There is also a supermarket in the lobby as well as a cafe and restaurant on the second floor.

The menu is expansive and we had to go through it many times before ordering on the tablet (only way to order). The server wasn't very helpful. But, worst of all, we were asked to leave after 90 minutes as that was all the time we were allowed-- and the next customer for our table was waiting!

All were absolutely exceptional. The best staff in the world. They’re a credit to the hotel. We were a family of three travelling with a 12 year old. We were all in one room which was tight but the bathroom was huge and fabulous and the product was gorgeous. The cupboard and storage was generous too. We had access to the Club which was fantastic. We could always grab a bite and a drink whenever we wanted. Happy Hour at 100 Sails was awesome (do the wings!!) and cheap and the location is FAB. A five minute walk to Ala Moana (you’ll spend 3 of these minutes waiting for the crossing lights) and we didn’t realise but you can scoot around the marina through the Hilton Hawaiian to the beach or walk along the beachfront from there to Waikiki which is far nicer than walking along the street. A special shout out to the very kind lady (concierge) in the Prince Club at 6.45am on January 21 who arranged us a taxi van to the airport. We had heaps of bags and an Uber XL was going to be $110. She organised a taxi van for $29 flat rate (plus $1 per bag). The van driver was superb too. The location of this hotel is awesome. Within 5 minutes walk of Ala Moana, a beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian and some fab eating spots. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel deserves a medal. A tip- if you miss the hotel shuttle - grab a Lyft. We found them far cheaper than an Uber. Also worth hiring a car for a day or two. We did and it’s SO easy to park at The Prince and a bargain (free) if it’s in your room deal. Thank you Prince staff. You’re legends.

Because we had a baby with us, we booked a Club Level to have easy access to breakfast and snacks throughout the day and planned to use the hotel a lot more than we normally would on these trips. The resort fell short of our expectations and we left disappointed. The check-in process was not smooth, which was a bad first impression. Our room key didn't work, our garage parking key didn't work multiple times, then our access to Club Lounge didn't work. That finally got sorted out two days. We had loud neighbors for two nights, where it was so bad, we could smell smoke in our rooms as well as loud music and what sounded like a huge party. The second night, I called to complain multiple times at 10pm, 11:30pm and then 1:30pm. We have a toddler, so this was not fun for us and we spent the next day in a foggy haze because of the lack of sleep for two nights in a row. I called to speak to management and all he did was apologize. Upon check-out, I asked for compensation, as to me, I felt like I lost one night because of the noise and their lack of attention to it, Just got a $50 credit off my bill. The hotel itself is nice and clean and we loved the pools, but they really need to listen to their customers more. We are returning in March solely for the location and accessibility to Ala Moana mall, the beach, and Waikiki.

We were traveling with friends who wanted to stay in the Waikiki area so we opted to try TripAdvisor’s #1 rated hotel and were not disappointed. Details below.We had stayed in various hotels in the Waikiki area so we know the lay of the land pretty well. The resorts right on the beach can be nice but most of them have very little beach area. We’re from Los Angeles so we are used to very wide, expansive beaches. Waikiki beach is often very, very narrow and with tons of hotel guests, not much sand space available to relax. Plus, there is a strong tourist-trap vibe to many of the establishments along the waterfront and it can be noisy and crowded.Once we stayed at a hotel tower a couple of blocks from the beach and got a sliver of an ocean view between other hotel towers. Cheaper than waterfront but with the limited view, could have been at any other hotel tower. We also stayed once at the New Otani at the (south?) end of Waikiki toward Diamond Head. That hotel has very small rooms but a great beach and a bit less hectic than hotels in the center of Waikiki.We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and enjoyed an amazing suite with Diamond Head views. HHV is not for everyone—tons of families and activities, but it does have the broadest beach on Waikiki and you never have to leave the property if you don’t want to explore the island.On other trips, we have stayed at the Kahala Resort beyond Diamond Head and nearer to Hanauma Bay. That’s one of my favorite resorts of all (see separate review) and is not too far from the action at Waikiki. We also had a very nice stays at Turtle Bay Resort in the North Shore and Marriott Ko-Olina (see separate reviews). Each has its charms but locations offer a very different experience than staying in Waikiki, which offers a lot more restaurant and shopping options.So, now to Prince Waikiki: if I wanted to stay close into Waikiki, I would definitely consider this hotel. It offers probably one of the best values in Waikiki hotels, with large rooms and available ocean views that are really terrific, with huge floor to ceiling windows that actually open so you can smell the ocean air. It does NOT have lanai’s (balconies). But it is a genuine ocean view (overlooking the marina and depending on room, a view of the beach at the Hilton or the beach park looking toward Honolulu). See my photo for an example of the view at sunset.While the hotel is perhaps two blocks to the beach, it is an easy, picturesque walk. The hotel is also situated so that you can drive a rental car in and out without constantly fighting mid-Waikiki traffic. There is also a hotel shuttle that is helpful. The pool is not huge but does offer a beautiful view of the ocean. We booked a cabana that includes a lot of stuff for $50 (drinks, pizza, sunscreen) but it was too windy the day we reserved so we cancelled, no hassle.The hotel staff is fantastic, friendly and laid back. We did not eat in the restaurants but the friends we traveled with ate at the sushi place in the hotel and reported that it was delish. There is a good coffee bar and market/gift shop that is convenient.The location of the hotel offers easy walking access to many restaurants and shops, whether at the Ala Moana shopping center, HHV or Waikiki.Another note: because this is a Prince property, the hotel caters to a lot of tourists from Japan. Best consequence of this: the toilets have Toto bidet-style seats. If you’ve never tried this, worth considering the hotel for that reason alone.Booking tip: booking directly at the hotel’s website and joining the Prince loyalty program gets you the best rates and the possibility of having the resort fee waived—important because that gets you free self-parking (!) and Internet access. Also, spring for an ocean view room—totally worth it.","Culver City, California","traveldan21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Culver City, California</strong>",239,5.0

We had issues with check in: we came a few hours early and were told that we should get the room by 11-12. So we decided to stick around instead of going to beach. They made us wait about 3 hours or more and even by 1:20 pm, the room wasn’t ready. I completely understand that this is a busy time and they were oversold but would’ve appreciated a semi-accurate heads up initially about check in time (would've gone to the beach instead of waiting in the lobby). They weren’t nice to us when we kept checking in every hour so since there was no communication from their side whatsoever. On checking in, we asked for some sunscreen, initially they said they’re out and then sent some up in a couple of hours. Upon asking for it again 2 days later, they said they don’t carry sunscreen. I disconnected and called back and the new person sent it up. This pattern continued when we asked for umbrellas at the entrance since it was raining that night, ie. one person said they don’t give them out, the other provided them to us. The rooms were comfortable apart from a couple of loud noises every night that initially woke us up, but then weren’t a problem when we used a white noise app. The pool was nice and the shuttle was convenient.Checkout was horrible, we asked for a half an hour extension at 10 am given our flight time, but were vigorously denied. They said they’re oversold and there’s no chance of a late checkout even by 10 mins. Then the front desk rep said they can do it and started working on it. We reached our room at 12:10 so we could leave by 12:20 but our room key wasn’t working. Took us another 5 mins to get housekeeping to open it and then got a call from the front desk at 12:15 asking us when we’re leaving, ie. the front desk rep earlier had lied and not even extended checkout by a minute.Overall, we loved our time in Hawaii but Prince was a bit disappointing given the $400 a night price point (we paid $1500 for 4 nights with no extra charges and no breakfast). We would’ve mentioned all of this to the front desk, but they didn’t ask us how our stay was at all. Hence, we left and decided to post a review. Again, I appreciate that they were oversold but being overwhelmed does not warrant treating guests poorly.","Berkeley, California","Pratham A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>",4,2.0

The floor to ceiling windows allow for a tremendous view of the ocean, the marina and the city skyline;-The pool area is spacious, the pool staff is attentive and when we were there, it wasn’t crowded;-The hotel staff in general was very pleasant and welcoming;-The hotel is located near a stop that is a pickup for a number of excursions—it’s just a 2 or 3 minute walk which was convenient.Cons:My cons are minimal. -I was originally traveling over the Thanksgiving holiday. Due to a sudden death in the family, I had to reschedule. The hotel charged the increased rates for the new dates. I thought that there would be some latitude given the reason for the change but no such luck. -Housekeeping was solid but not spectacular (i.e. I had to repeatedly ask for toiletries, extra towels). With that being said, I did not want to leave! This was my third trip to Oahu. When I do return, it will be to the Prince Waikiki.

The room was clean and spacious and the hotel upgraded us to the 26th floor which had a beautiful view of the marina and the sunset in the evening. The concierge staff were great and recommended some awesome activities in the island we could go see while we had our rental vehicle. They even surprised us with a bottle of champagne with a personalized label one of the nights. It was a nice touch! The breakfast buffet was fully stocked with fresh fruit and tons of food. The staff in the 100 Sails Restaurant were awesome! Specifically the hostess, Ekini and one of the servers, Ken. They were both super friendly and welcoming! The hotel was close enough to the main Waikiki Beach that we could take a quick shuttle there or even walk the 20 minutes if we wanted, but was far enough away that we didn’t feel smothered by all the other tourist traffic.

When we checked in, our room was upgraded and we received coupons for free drinks (coffee/tea/beer/wine) and mimosas at the restaurant. In our room, there was champaign, chocolate covered strawberries, and a nice note from the general manager. It was such a thoughtful touch that really made the night. We enjoyed the strawberries and champaign while watching the Friday night fireworks that we could see from our window. The room was spacious and clean. It had a very comfortable king sized bed and small sitting area with a couch. The bathroom was also spacious with both a bathtub and shower. We also booked a pool cabana for half a day (11-3pm) for $50. It was completely worth it because we had our own space and it came with 4 bottles of water, 2 cocktails, sunscreen, and a pizza. I would highly suggest reserving a cabana if you want to spend time at the pool. Lastly, the food at the 100 Sails restaurant is delicious. We tried the dinner and breakfast buffet. The dinner buffet included crab and made to order sushi rolls. The breakfast buffet included an omelette station and many savory and sweet options. Both had delicious food but my favorite was the breakfast buffet. Our stay at the Prince was memorable and very enjoyable. I will be coming back for staycations and recommending it to others.

I like to stay in Honolulu for the food and for shopping. For the last couple of stays, the Modern Hotel a block away was my usual choice. Actually, back in the day, the Kahala when it was a Mandarin was great. The Modern was a more understated choice. It appears the Prince is now top of the pile because it was recently renovated, and it turned out to be a good choice.I reserved very last minute, so I got a 1-bedroom suite at a steep discount, about USD 700 per day. The views from the suite were amazing. The room itself - very few complaints. One minor episode was the radio. After the room is cleaned or after turn down, it appears the staff intentionally leave the radio on at low volume. Mine happened to be tuned to a talk radio station. When I returned to my room at night, it sounded as if I could hear the conversation in the next room. Turned out my radio was on. Took me about an hour to figure that out.The furnishings of the room are good. Again, this was a suite, so plenty of storage. No issues with the coffee machine, Wifi, TVs (with Netflix), refrigerator (please consider including creamers for coffee in fridge). Bathroom was huge, amenities were in-house brand (just OK - I used my own shampoo, etc.).Breakfast at the lobby restaurant was nice, waitress was very actively filling my coffee cup.The gym was well furnished.The gym is next to a deck area which has the pool and bar. I didn't find the vibe of the bar area that welcoming - decided to take sunset photos from my room instead.The staff at the hotel are cheerful. My impression is they won't go out of their way as you would see at a top resort, but for being at a large hotel as part of the Waikiki market, they seemed on top of things and helpful.The main driver for selecting this hotel was the proximity to the Ala Moana Mall. However, seeing that the offerings of the mall have gone down a bit, I might consider a stay at another place.

The hotel does provide shuttle bus service (which I didn't use because we had a car and we like walking).It's not a beach front hotel so that's good and bad but not being beach front means that there's less foot traffic (which we like). It is pretty close to the public beach area that's next to the Grand Hilton (5 minute walk).","Richmond, Canada","963EdL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

We decided to upgrade to the 32nd floor and do the prince club. Boy am I glad we did!

They leave the door open to where the food is kept and birds fly in. We were grabbing dinner our second night when we found bird drippings in the silverware. We told the lady working and she simply cleaned off the dropping and put it back. We decided against eating there again. The room had a fantastic view and everyone was super friendly to us. We ordered room service and it came very quick, and it was wonderful. I thought I was having allergies to the area because it's tropical and all. Turns out they have down bedding and I am very allergic. I figured that out the last night we were staying unfortunately. I told the front desk and they replaced my pillows so I at least could breath when flying out the next day! They were very apologetic. I wish our stay was longer.

If you're OK just eating a burger or something simple, it's for you. If you're looking for a solid steak or something higher-end, go elsewhere.3. Skip the spa/massage.

She found a great deal from Costco, and this hotel did not disappoint. The Costco promo included major benefits to us, such as a room discount, breakfast every morning at 100 Sails, as well as self-parking being included in our price and was not an extra. These benefits were the main reasons we stayed at Prince Waikiki, but there are several other reasons why this hotel was a great find! Firstly, I cannot say enough about the hotel staff. They were amazing, very courteous, knowledgeable, and accommodating to us. As this was our first trip to Hawaii, we were excited, but also not sure what to expect. Upon checking in, we were regularly greeted by our last name, and the staff of 100 Sails went above and beyond in our opinion to ensure our stay was the best. I have had good service at previous hotels in other cities, but Prince takes the title of the best service I have ever experienced. The next best thing about this hotel is the location. It is only a short walk to Waikiki Beach, which we did twice. There is also a shuttle service, but we did not take it, so I cannot comment on that part. The location next to the harbor is peaceful, quiet, and not as crowded (cars and people) as other areas closer to Waikiki Beach. As this hotel was not at Waikiki Beach this meant we did not have as much trouble with the often congested Honolulu traffic. We were also within a short walk to Ala Moana Center, which was great for shopping and quick / cheap places to eat. If you don't need to walk out of your hotel right on to a beach, but still want quick access this hotel is for you. If you want to be able to get out of the downtown area quickly so you can spend more time exploring the natural beauty of Oahu, this hotel is for you. We would definitely stay at this hotel again!

Rooms were clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room was equipped with everything we needed (fridge, slippers, clothes line,  ""to go"" coffee cups, flashlight). There was even a kettle,  which we appreciated,  since most hotels tend to only have a coffee maker (in which case your tea inevitably always tastes like coffee). We were even able to get a microwave for the room for no additional charge. As we were celebrating our anniversary, a complimentary bottle of wine was sent to our room,  which was a nice surprise. The Hotel Grounds: Well-kept pool area and gym. We enjoyed the infinity pool over looking the marina. Lobby was grand and beautifully decorated, with relaxing Hawaiian music playing in the background.  Fruit infused water was available in the lobby. A few dining options were available on site.  We only tried the breakfast buffet at 100 Sails, which was a great buffet with many options including an omelette bar. Service: The hotel staff was absolutely wonderful.  There was a kind gentleman at the valet, who warmly welcomed us upon our arrival.  We also interacted with the front desk staff,  restaurant staff, the shuttle bus driver and the concierge. All were pleasant, warm, genuine and helpful and tried to make your stay the best it could be. Location: Hotel is located minutes from the Ala Moana Center, which was great since we went there a few times for meals and to buy some groceries from Foodland.  We liked that the hotel was in Waikiki but not in the center, so it wasn't as loud / crowded but yet close enough to the excitement.  Hotel is close to the Hilton, which means you could see the Friday night fireworks from an oceanfront room or from the pool deck.Hotel Amenities: While you do have to pay a resort fee, you do get a lot as part of it.  In addition to access to the pool and the gym, we saw that there were activities like hula lessons that you could participate in if you like.  Through your resort fee, you also get a couple bottles of water each day, use of the phone in your room, self-parking, wifi and an environmental bag (which was pretty good quality and came in pretty handy) among other things.  There is also a shuttle service that runs between the Ala Moana Centre and Waikiki Beach, which was also helpful since parking in Waikiki could be difficult.If we are ever back in Oahu, we would definitely want to return to Prince Waikiki.  ",,ellie1258,5,5.0

Then there is the very large Ala Moana mall with shops galore and restaurants too, which is just a few minutes walk inland or once again the free hotel shuttle bus goes there!!Also we found this hotel to be a quiet haven. We went to a few of the other larger hotel chains along Waikiki Beach and it was crowded and noisy and we just got lost in the mass of humanity.The staff was friendly without being familiar and we had great service from everyone. Called reception, concierge and housekeeping from our room and each time we had very positive responses. And what mattered most was the calls were answered with politeness and you can detect a 'smile' in their voices.The room was spacious, well maintained and clean. Housekeeping did a perfect job each time and we did not have to request for anything. Tour desk was a great help in our bookings as we did all our excursions there. Concierge guys were great and most 'welcoming'.Views from the room were fantastic and the sunsets were brilliant. A different spectacle each evening we were there. Also from our room we watched the fireworks display put on by the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Friday night.We booked a club room as there was a good package deal that we got and this added to the wonderful experience we had. The club lounge was located just by the main pool and was a good place to relax coupled with friendly and helpful staff.The hotel shuttle bus and the obliging drivers was a real added bonus to the stay.All in all we loved the Prince Waikiki and would gladly recommend it to anyone.","Auckland,NZ","Meng F C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland,NZ</strong>",48,5.0

Top notch service and quality. We walked towards the front desk and were immediately greeted with a smile and ""aloha"". We were quickly checked in, pleasurable small talk, and the freak desk clerk even played a fun little game with us, having us guess the sent inside the cool cloths that were provided. Great first impression.I booked this hotel solely due to its beautiful views. Floor to ceiling windows are one of my most favorite things in life and not many hotels provide this. Prince Waikiki delivered with its views. The room was small. But my husband and I were so busy exploring the island that we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. We did LOVE the baday in the bathroom! Neither of us ever experienced one before and it was life changing. We also appreciated the daily complimentary waters. We did a LOT of hiking while on Oahu so the waters really came in handy. We also appreciated that we could go to the front desk at anytime and ask for another water before we headed out for the day. Great service!The hotel was very clean. I did not come across a single bug during our stay here. Ive were on our honeymoon trip and I had let Price Waikiki know when I made the booking. Upon our arrival the cutest bottle of Champagne was in our fridge along with a congratulations note. It was the most adorable and welcoming present we received. It even had our names on the bottle! I wish I could have kept it as a keepsake.We used the gym a few times while we were here and it really had everything you could need for a good, quick workout. The pool was beautiful and clean as well. There weren't many children here either, which for me was a major plus. All if all if your looking for a great romantic get away this hotel is it. I could have easily spent the entire day just lounging around in the room with the giant windows open and then getting one drinks at the infinity pool. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone without kids.","Renton, Washington","chel_sayR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Renton, Washington</strong>",7,5.0

Yes it is expensive but comparatively it is decent value. We had a club room on the 31st floor (Diamond Head Tower) and the view was breathtaking. We arrived late at the property for check-in around 1030pm and the service at check-in was great. Our luggage was brought up to our room and then the staff member spent time explaining the functions of the room. Also came back and brought extra slippers and water bottles.

Having stayed at luxury resorts and luxury hotels in Hawaii, Prince Waikiki falls short. An ocean front room, while it comes with a nice view, did not feel like a luxury room at all. All rooms at this hotel come with a view of the harbor, so the price for an upgraded room doesn't feel worth it. Storage - Storage in the room is an absolute joke. There was ONE DRAWER available for storage. ONE. The dresser under the TV was constructed to hide a safe, a fridge, and a small bar set, leaving you with literally one drawer for storage. As someone who hates to live out of a suitcase while on a week-long vacation, I found the lack of storage space completely annoying. There is a closet with a few hangers, and a high shelf to put a few things, but storage is a definite problem Bathroom - nice. However, the toilet is merely closed off by a glass door that does not touch the ceiling or the floor, so you can very much hear another person using the bathroom while in the shower, tub, or using the sink, and even in the bedroom. The shelf in the shower for toiletries is tiny and can fit maybe 3-4 mini toiletry bottles. The toilet is a fancy electric heated/bidet combo that my 6'1"" partner felt was too low to the ground for him to sit and get up from comfortably. The ocean view room we got had a large banquet we felt was a waste of space. The near half of the room used for the banquet and a table area could have been used for an additional dresser to use for storage. Service - housekeeping did a nice job and was always very fast. The front desk, however, seemed to be understaffed at all times. Upon check in at 4 PM, there were two people working the desk, one doing something at the computer besides checking customers from the increasing line. Walking through the lobby at all times of the day, I saw a line always formed for desk services. Check out at 12 PM had the same problem of two people working the desk with a long line. One or two other people at the desk would help. Parking - we had parking included in our room package price, however the parking lot is a mess. Good luck finding parking if you park later than midday. Twice, we took the last available spot in the entire lot, and three times, the lot was full with no sign to alert drivers coming in. We were forced to use valet. ","Chicago, Illinois","sophiavero88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",1,3.0

You can walk to the Ala Moana mall and you can walk to the beach at the Hilton village. What I was looking forward to was a ocean view that I paid extra to enjoy. When I checked in I was told I was upgraded! Love those words! Sadly, I was not happy with the room. Room 514 is right across from the elevator and on the deck of the pool. My view was not good and everyone on the deck could see into my room. This room had zero privacy and was loud. I didn't complain because I didn't have the time. In the morning I dreamed of sitting on my lanai to drink my coffee and enjoy the view before our long day of moving. Mostly, I ended up talking to the cleaning crew and watching the early morning parents and their kids in the pool.The room was nice by the outdated Honolulu standards and I loved the friendly and helpful staff.

It was my son's birthday so they brought him a piece of cake with a card. Free water all day. You could take the pool towels to the beach. Handy business center. Free WIFI with great connection. Everything was wonderful from start to finish. They don't have grounds as they are not beachfront but the beach is just a stroll away and I guess that is what makes this hotel so peaceful. We walked by all the other beachfront hotels in Waikiki and their pools and grounds were so so crowded. Very close to the Ala Moana Shopping and to all kind of restaurants and high-end shopping in Ala Moana Boulevard.

We ate in the restaurant, went to the bar for happy hour, and enjoyed lunch by the pool on several occasions. Even relaxing in the room felt like vacation, with the warm breeze and beautiful view from the windows. The hotel has a great location. We were able to walk to many places, including Waikiki Beach, Ala Moana shopping center, Ala Moana Beach Park, and many restaurants & shops. The hotel concierge was very helpful in scheduling events/tours that we were interested in. I used the fitness center most mornings, and visited the pool almost every day. If you stay here, I recommend taking a day and reserving one of the poolside cabanas - very relaxing, and well worth the price since it comes with lunch and drinks.

For me, the location of it being at the edge of Waikiki, more near the Ala Moana side, was why I had chosen it. Definitely didn’t want anything in the heart of Waikiki, as it’s just too congested there, especially when they have those street festivals and traffic is horrendous. I had the once in a lifetime opportunity of staying here for 7nights during Nov. 2018 with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that it was like a dream staying here and loved this place so much. There was honestly nothing negative we could say about staying here and nothing bad that we had experienced while we were staying here. We were both sad on that last day when we had to say good-bye to our room and we didn’t want our time there to end. This is a feeling that I’m sure is understandably shared by many who had stayed at the Prince Waikiki - you just don’t want to leave.Everything from the warm and helpful service we received from staff upon check-in, the complimentary bottle of champagne and fresh pineapple plus chocolates that we received, the fruit-infused water at the lobby area to quench your thirst, to the incredibly comfortable bed inside the bright and spacious room, large bathroom with Japanese bidet toilet, and the breathtaking views from the room, were all simply unforgettable. Even the food served at their on-site restaurant is amazing, especially their “Kakuni Pork Benedict” that’s available on their menu for breakfast - you will not regret ordering this! If you are able to stay here, then by all means, definitely do, it’ll be something to remember positively for a lifetime. I’m originally from HI, had lived there for 20yrs and can attest to the fact that out of all the hotels on the island of O’ahu that I’ve stayed at, this is without any doubts whatsoever, THE BEST one.

I would say this is among the top 5 of all Hawaii hotels and likely our choice next time, with Kahala being a close competition. This hotel has very beautiful ocean view rooms, is close to Ala Moana shopping center, and has a great coffee shop on site and a generally attentive staff. The only noticeable drawback was it is not on ocean front, so it's harder than other hotel to access the beach (requires 5-10 minute walk).But the only reason I am not giving it 5 out of 5 is that during our 8 nights here in first week of June 2019, we had a false fire alarm in the middle of the night that required me to hug my 2 year old down 26 floors of stairs. The front desk staff was very junior and doesn't do much to calm us. Next morning, the staff was still catching up what had happened and offered casual apologies. I didn't complain at checkout as it is not the hotel's fault as there was likely some burning stuff in some floor that wasn't major. But I think the management should definitely acknowledge it and offered some formal apology for the inconvenience (e.g, a letter with a cookie might be enough) or at least the staff should mentioned it at check out. I hope they could learn from this and next time I could update my reviews to 5 our of 5 as I think the hotel deserves it.","Atlanta, Georgia, United States","DukeW_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia, United States</strong>",30,4.0

The hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of wine with a custom label (our names, Happy 20th Anniversary) and a card. Everyone was extremely nice from the time you enter the hotel. The view from our room were breathtaking.We only ate at the restaurant during happy hour because they stayed busy. If you go try the salt and Vinegar wings if you are as fan of wings. The pool was amazing and the drinks are very good. This hotel is located one block from the Ala Moana center (mall), with too many stores to count! The hotel does have a shuttle that goes to Ala Moana, Waikiki Beach and a few other stops. Some other places within walking distance are, ABC store for all the things forgotten at home, souvenirs, snacks and many other things! There is a longs drug store at Ala Moana that has cheaper prices. You can also fine Outback, Red Lobster, McDonalds, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Subway are some of the few known food chains we seen within walking distance of the hotel. One of our favorite breakfast spots located near the hotel was Cinnamons...it’s a must if you stay at Prince Waikiki! It’s located within walking distance of the hotel as well. Overall this hotel is amazing and I would definitely stay again.

I travel a lot for business, so to have a stay for pleasure is such a treat, that I decided to do the ""#1 hotel on Tripadvisor"" in Honolulu. My initial greeting was not the best; I was struggling with 3 bags and no doorman was there to open the door. I looked back and there was one who was slowly walking, but by the time I got into the door, he still wasn't there to open the door. The front desk was weird too. I stood there for a solid 2-3 minutes before I received any eye contact. One told me to go to the other person, but then other person answered the phone, so then I had to go back to the original person who told me to go to her colleague.. I eventually got checked in and the front desk warmed up and greeted me Happy Birthday. I don't know if they upgraded me, but I did get an Ocean Front Harbor view. Absolutely stunning views! Definitely the one of the two Pros of this hotel- the other was the room was really spacious. Again, I travel A LOT for work, so I always do a bed check. Shocked to see they didn't invest in a bed bug mattress cover. For being top rated hotel, you think this would be a standard. So sure enough, I saw blood stains on the sheets (see photos). House keeping was made aware and they changed the sheet immediately, but the lady was really unpleasant, the man was very understanding and cheerful. As for the ""spa"".. they should really advertise it as a room, not a spa. This has nothing to do with the workers, as the workers greeted me so nicely and the masseuse was very good and professional. But for a 4 star hotel, you can't invest on an actual spa? For those thinking of doing a spa treatment, just be aware it's literally in a sleeping room, with a small table outside the door that says it's the ""spa"". Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the #1 hotel experience I've had. Definitely wish I did the Four Seasons, but the location was a bit farther from the airport, so that's the trade off.","Hoboken, New Jersey","totheloonthego</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hoboken, New Jersey</strong>",3,3.0

We checked in on May 19 around 2 pm. The front desk person asked us to write down each person's name and contact information who stay in each room. It's a long wait for doing that. I believe that could be a better way for a large group of people. I booked only one room at a higher level that adds an extra bed, and I still have been asked which room should add a bed. Not sure if the information was not in the system or the front desk person didn't notice that. The bed supposed to be added before we arrived. Besides, two rooms have been checked in before other people arrived. The front desk person provided me the wrong information, saying they only got one room with three people.

We stayed here as my partner had a conference to attend in this hotel, so it was the easy button.The hotel caters to Japanese tourists, and even has a very good (I'm told, we didn't eat there) sushi restaurant on site. We had booked a room with a king bed, but were told they didn't have any left when we checked in and were instead offered a room with 2 queens on a higher floor, ""with a better view"" instead. Ok, fine- but maybe offer me a higher tier room or a dining credit or something if you booked out what we reserved instead of just moving us to a ""higher floor"".That said, the service at the hotel was impeccable. I spent my mornings and early afternoons out and about, but came back to the hotel around 4pm each day worn out from hiking, diving, etc, showered, and retired to the pool to relax until my partner freed up from ""work"" at the conference and we went back out for the evening. At the pool, Howard took great care of me (and all the pool guests). Somehow that guy manages to remember the names, room numbers, and favorite drink of everyone he meets. There's nothing like a cold drink brought to you while lounging in the hot tub or the infinity pool after a hard day of sight-seeing :) Thanks Howard!I was also somewhat surprised that the prices for food/drink at the hotel were not unreasonably jacked up. O'ahu is an expensive place to start with, but I didn't pay that much more for things at the Prince than what I did out and about. That was a nice surprise.Lastly, the hotel is nicely situated for views over the bay and watching the sunsets.",NoVA,"madpharoah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NoVA</strong>",30,4.0

A bit noisy overnight, but well blocked if you close the window. I loved the fact that we could open the windows which we did constantly. A word of warning..... you cannot turn the air conditioning on when the windows are open, even a small amount. I didn’t realise my window was open when I called housekeeping to help me out, and they explained this fact. Our bed was remarkably comfortable and large++! The choice of TV channels was poor. Had ongoing problems with wifi dropping out on my devices constantly, but otherwise fairly good connection. One teabag per day quota stingy. The swimming pool and surrounding area was terrific and I was able to do a few laps in the infinity pool each day. I would not, however, like to have my room overlooking the pool. It was accessible at all hours, and could be quite busy at night. People can be rather inconsiderate! Overall, we had a great stay. It was convenient to the Convention centre along the canal and the Ala Moana, and although a decent walk to the main hub of Waikiki, it was a pleasant stroll during the balmy evenings. We certainly walked a lot over our stay. If you don’t want to walk, there is a terrific shuttle bus service from the hotel to the Ala Moana and Waikiki shops so the distance doesn’t have to be an impediment.

I like to vacation in less hectic places where I can hear myself think and Waikiki not that. It’s great if you want to shop and dine out and party but I can travel much closer and for far less money to great cities to get that. I love cities but when I think Hawaii, I think beach. I’ve been to Waikiki twice before and frankly couldn’t wait to leave. After staying at the PW, I can’t wait to go back!!! After looking at pictures online I was looking forward to seeing the infinity pool and checking out the boats in the bay but what I was not expecting was the room and view. I was blown away by the floor to ceiling windows. The view was incredible and the windows even opened!! PICTURES DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE. Watching the sun rise and then set from bed with a cup of coffee was a special treat. The room, though on the smaller side had high ceilings and a really open feeling. It was elegant but not stuffy and left me thinking, “this is really all the space you need!” The pool was beautiful as shown on the website and when I went, was not packed. Finding a chair was easy. There are restaurants on site and many in walking distance so no worries there. The beach is also just a short walk away. There are two beach options. The closer of the two is in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It’s fairly crowded but great for people watching and enjoying the ocean. The cost was really reasonable and blows many hotels/resorts I’ve stayed at for 2 and 3 times the cost out of the water. I can’t wait to go back!","Atlanta, Georgia","jes7732018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",3,5.0

I purchased a vacation thru Costco and let me tell you, it was definitely worth it!I paid extra to be upgraded to the Oceanfront Premier Room, which meant a higher floor. Our package included the daily buffet breakfast, day use of a pool cabana (which included a 12 in pizza, 4 bottled waters, sunscreen and 2 cocktail-sooo worth it!) and a 20% discount when dining at 100 Sails Restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (We took advantage of it when we dined during the seafood buffet dinner.)We were on the 30th floor and the views were soooooo breathtaking! Our room had 2 queens. At first it seemed on the small side, but was fine as the days went on. We were only there to sleep and take a break from the beach/pool. The ONLY hiccup we had during our stay was that we had to change rooms after the first night. It was probably my fault as I should have mentioned I was a light sleeper and didn't want to be near the elevator. Well, when the elevator doors opened, our room was right in front of it! I thought it wouldn't have been an issue but at 3:30 in the morning I could hear the elevator. We managed to switch rooms the next morning to a room on the same floor. Easy peasy! (I didn't unpack just in case.)The bathroom was large with a seperate shower, tub and toilet. The toilet ""room"" even had a bidet!!! I never knew how much I would miss it until I went home. hahaha. Housekeeping did an awesome job cleaning our room during our stay. We had all the comforts of home and I loved that we were away from the business of Waikiki. We were able to take advantage of the shuttle but one of the days it wasn't running because of SpamJam, which had the main streets of Waikiki closed so traffic was horrendous-our Lyft driver didn't even pick us up because of traffic.We took advantage of the daily buffet breakfast at least 4 of the days we were there. It was so helpful especially on the days when we had an early morning start before the beach or a hike.The pool was lovely!!I loved the infinity pool, which made for great photos. It was never really loud or had too many kids. It was definitely a place for us to relax.We had a car rental for 3 days and liked the fact that parking was already included in the hotel stay. The only thing not included was a $31.41 daily resort fee, which is fine since most hotels are charging that now.Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel was always welcoming/helpful and always had a smile.

The service is incredible, the rooms are amazingly clean, the pool is unbelievable (with a bar right next to it serving you drinks while in it!), and overall the hotel is just the definition of what I want when I want to stay in a great hotel in a great place. The service is always with a smile! I am a local, and I really appreciate the entire staff's positive attitude and their passion for what they do. You are always their top priority no matter what, and it really shows in the quality of their service to you. The rooms are impeccably clean. The bathrooms have amazingly deep tubs, great showers, the views are amazing, and they are always spotless. The rooms have large wall-sized windows that you can open up to let the island breeze pour into the room. Overall, the rooms are always top-notch! The pool is my favorite part of this hotel. There is a hot tub, a normal pool, and then an infiniti pool. All of this is on the fifth floor of the hotel, so you are overlooking the nearby Ala Wai harbor and its million-dollar yachts and sailboats going in and out. You can see up and down the O'ahu coast, an amazing skyline, and amazing sunsets right from the pool. To add to that, there is a bar right next to the pool that will bring you drinks so that you never have to get out of the water once for anything!

There is a little store in the lobby to buy small drinks. We were checked in by a lady named pammie - She was so lovely, so detailed and hospitable! They gave us an earlier check in as we had a baby.

Bed very comfortable and ample storage space in room. Bathroom also well equipped with shower and separate tub, and good quality toiletries.We had opted for the Club set up (rooms are on the top 3 floors) - breakfast was OK, however, we preferred eating out, so only had the breakfast a few of the mornings. We found the Club Lounge a nice place to relax occasionally during the day, particularly if the pool area was too busy. We also enjoyed the free wine in the evenings - quality was acceptable, and the staff in the Club Lounge were very friendly (especially Marley). Snacks were OK, but unlike in other Club Lounges we have used, you couldn't really use these as your evening meal.Only real complaint was that housekeeping was a bit hit and miss - we had to phone down a few times as our room seemed to have been missed - this was a bit puzzling as some of the days we were missed we actually saw the cleaner in the room next door. Wasn't a huge problem as usually got there in the end - just a bit of a minor irritant.We had stayed across the road at the Equus on a previous visit to Honolulu (7 years ago), so quite like this area. 10 minutes walk along to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, where there are many shops as well as bars / restaurants.In the opposite direction, it took us around half an hour to walk along to Waikiki Beach, either along the beach itself or following the road.All in all we had a very good holiday - most of the staff we encountered were very friendly, and everything was clean and bright.We would definitely return here if we were back in Honolulu.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","DJM52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",20,5.0

The infinity pool on the 5th floor is beautiful and there are many fewer young kids running around than when we stayed at a larger, resort-style hotel on the big island. The deal they are running now, we got the 7th night free plus free parking. The people are very friendly and want to help. The affiliated golf course is a lot of fun (hubby played 27 holes). The massages that we got from Naio Bliss (Lomi lomi) we’re extremely relaxing. There’s a convenient shop downstairs with resort reasonable prices (deodorant, which hubs forgot, was only $4) and there’s a Honolulu Coffee which makes a darn good americano. There is nightly turndown, during which you get a tasty chocolate plus two free bottles of water. They also have free WiFi.Cons: Restaurant (100 Seas) is just meh. They advertise a golf course, but it’s 35+ minutes off site, not at the hotel. The shuttle to said golf course only runs twice a day. While its waterfront, it is not beachfront - you either have to walk to the Hilton or to the public beach - both about a quarter of a mile give or take. The infinity pool, while beautiful, is tiny. There is no spa onsite (they offer massages but that’s basically it, and you do it either near the pool in a cabana or in a vacant hotel room). Perhaps most annoying, our lock just stopped working on our third night here. We were on our way home from a dive, desperately wanting a shower, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for them to bring up engineering and troubleshoot our door. They were very apologetic about it... but that’s basically it. No offers to make it right otherwise, nothing.","Oakland, California","sarahtbest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",16,3.0

This is our first and last time staying on this end of Waikiki. We only stayed here because of Costco special. “Free” airport transfer meant being herded into a cattle car so every seat was filled. We thankfully were first drop off out of six stops. But we still had to follow the one family who needed to go to baggage claim to get luggage. Check in was okay, but nothing completely explained which you don’t realize until you are in the moment..like where the restaurant for free breakfast buffet included in our package is. Food not great. Omelette station good and the Japanese style breakfast okay. She told us third floor but did not mention you cannot get to the third floor by the hotel elevator. You have to go back down to lobby, then you have to take an escalator from the lobby to the restaurant or up one level to a different set of elevators. Our welcome package including free bottles of water were not in our room. After second day of still not receiving, we called housekeeping who then delivered, but they realized they forgot to deliver to all guests and were suddenly knocking on doors to deliver bags. We ended up with two. Hotel needs to work on customer service which is hit or miss here. Housekeeping clearly needs a lot of help learning how to properly clean rooms. They need to realize people pay a lot of money to stay here and should be more understanding and apologetic when the guest finds out she is allergic to all their toiletries and has to go out hunting for these things in the dark after traveling all day with bad directions of how to get to the store by housekeeping and the front desk...with no apology. The only friendly service was the guys at the front door. Service at Front desk, restaurant, shuttle inconsistent. Housekeeping of room, on phone and encounters in hallway all bad..because they only have ice on floors 9, 19, and 28. Don’t imply I’m there for ill-intent when I’m holding a room card and an ice bucket and your cart is blocking the door to the ice machine.

The hotel is relatively new, ideally located with well appointed rooms, great ocean & marina views, and has the potential to be much better. Our issues with this hotel relate to (a) we booked an ocean view room with a king bed, but were allocated a room with 2 x queen beds; (b) their internet service; and (c) our dining experience. We did not have internet access on day 1 of our stay, and after that we continued to experience intermittent issues/delays (which made it difficult communicating with family & business in Australia), and then on our last night, the television system failed. As for our dining experience, on our first night we arrived at the in-house restaurant at ~6:00pm, and was told no tables would be available until 8:30pm, so we decided to dine casually at the bar (where the service was very good). However, we noticed >15 tables (x4) were empty/vacant, and even when we finished up at 8:15pm, there was still ~12 tables (x4) empty/vacant, so we don't understand why we couldn't have dined in the restaurant, because, after all, it was a buffet (USD$65 per head), and didn't require wait staff. Additionally, we do prefer to eat healthy, and when we went to breakfast in the morning, we always have cereal and fruit, but the only cereal on offer was Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes, and when we asked if there was any other more healthy options (eg. granola) we were informed that there was no other cereal on offer.

The room was spotless and with a longer stay, we especially appreciated the oversized room dimensions. Loved the pool area and views of the harbor, watching the boats come and go. Great on-site dining options and a fun happy hour. (Find Cullen in the 3rd floor bar area for reviews of all the menu items!) Location on the perimeter of town was ideal and you could still walk to beaches. We probably stopped at the concierge desk once a day and always received helpful tips. We utilized the on-site parking and the garage was convenient and spots always available. Even the lobby is gorgeous, bright and welcoming. This might be the first hotel I’ve stayed at where it actually looks like the website pictures! Every single member of the staff was so kind. We had considered staying in the heart of downtown but are glad we chose Prince Waikiki. It’s much more peaceful, newer and a better overall value.

You can sit in the infinity pool sipping a drink and watch surfers, boats coming and going from the marina, or the beautiful sunsets.It’s just a short walk to Ala Moana but the hotel offers a shuttle service to both the shopping mall and to 3 locations in Waikiki.We love this hotel and recommend it to all our friends and family","Auckland, New Zealand","462robertcooper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",2,5.0

Rooms were spacious, spotless and nicely decorated, with comfortable beds and good linens. There are no balconies, but a wall of windows overlooked the yacht harbor, so our room had lovely views. Bathroom was fine.We liked the location, just at the edge of Waikiki: an easy (10-20 minute) walk to Waikiki beach and all the big hotels, but in a quiet, tranquil location. The pool area was very attractive.There is, however, a big negative to this hotel. For a large hotel, the food options are surprisingly limited and very much below par. There is a coffee bar in the huge lobby; a small sushi restaurant on the lobby level that seemed popular; and 100 Sails, the main option, located up several levels from the lobby, on the events floor. 100 Sails is a sprawling space with no real decor or ambiance and terrible lighting, resembling a hastily repurposed events hall. The night we were there, it featured an all-you-can-eat buffet, with the only other option being a limited and unappealing menu. The items we ordered were pretty bad, including a tasteless Caesar Salad (a hard dish to ruin). There are few good dining options within a block or two of the Prince, so having a decent place to eat is even more important.We were surprised that the only bar was the one in the middle of 100 Sails-- a brightly lit, unpleasant space. During the day, there is a bar outside in the pool area, but that closed early.Also, given the lack of balconies in the rooms, having a relaxing outdoor restaurant would be a great addition. We'd probably stay here again, but make sure we had dinner reservations somewhere else.","Pasadena, California","pasca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasadena, California</strong>",78,4.0

Initially, we were placed in a room that overlooked the harbour and Ala Moana Blvd. I had booked an “Ocean Premier” to ensure we didn’t have a room like this so I called down to the front desk and they were very understanding, and immediately found us a room with a clear ocean view. It was outstanding to have the windows open 24/7 and open our eyes each morning to brilliant sunrises through the floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows. Hearing the ocean was a relaxing way to fall asleep after a busy day. Everyone at the hotel was fabulous and friendly. Housekeeping came by every day at the same time and did a great job as well. Bell desk always very helpful and had a lot of info about dining and things to to do.We had a vehicle so took advantage of the free parking with the resort fee. Finding a spot was almost never an issue, except the weekend.The location is right next to the HHV lagoon so it’s at a quiet end of Waikiki that allows access to the beaches (plus 2 lagoons and plenty of water sports). Also had a spectacular, uncrowded view of the fireworks on Friday on the pool deck with a drink in hand while listening to a local artist play at the poolside lounge. Amazing evening! Within walking distance of Ala Moana Mall for tons of shopping and eating options. Many other food options in the area (Goofy’s was our favourite breakfast spot). I ordered pizza from room service one night-it had to have been a frozen pizza warmed up because the middle was cool and the cheese barely melted. Very disappointed as could have ordered take out through the meal delivery service in Waikiki but wanted to make it easy. Will know for next time. We walked and never felt unsafe, although there are a few tents, the people keep to themselves. There was one morning around 3 am that I was awake, and heard people below (we had the window open the entire stay). I looked out to see two guys going vehicle to vehicle testing door handles. Keep doors locked and nothing in them to avoid being a victim of theft. This hotel truly made us feel like we were on a holiday from the moment we pulled up until the moment we drove away.

Check-in was very fast and the desk person was do friendly. She explained the room type we got. The view was incredible seeing the full Oceanside from Diamond Head to Ewa. Even the harbor below was gorgeous. King size bed was great and the bathroom blew my wife away. Shower big enough for both of us was an unexpected surprise as was the very nice welcome and thank you card from the GM. Included in the stay was also a small discount for the buffet lunch just before check-out...NICE! We were also given 2 coupons for free coffees at the coffee Cafe in the lobby. That was the icing on the cake. It had to one of the best anniversary surprises I've done. The hotel was so beautiful as expected, clean as expected, service was also 5 Star as expected.

And to top it off you won’t get an ocean view because Prince Waikiki is an “only-ocean-view” hotel.I feel really welcomed here as soon as I arrive. I don’t feel like I’m being hustled or smothered with good service for a tip by the doormen. I feel like that at other hotels in Honolulu in the past.Because they could not build it in the middle of Alamoana Center, this is the ideal location to walk off your meal back to Prince Waikiki to rest and you can always walk back for more shopping and eats so that you do not cramp it all in one day.The block Prince Waikiki is in has affordable franchise eateries as well as popular island restaurants that you will like to include in your list of places to dine. However, you do not have to go far in the hotel to enjoy 100 Sails Restaurant and Bar. I loved that you can have a quick cheap bite at the bar or take your time to the excellent island cuisine in the restaurant. I love Japanese food, too. I always have at least one meal at Katsumidori on the lobby floor.In sharing why I enjoy Prince Waikiki, I want say that it allows me to take my time to walk anything off and, more importantly, it makes it possible to spend time in the sun; longer than the usual carpark to mall front entrance that I am used to. I refused to rely on a car while in Honolulu. I am not in a hurry. I enjoy catching the bus when needed for only $2.50 per trip. This is the reason I am on vacation; to break the monotony of what I have been doing the past 12 months.I love Prince Waikiki. I swim and go to the gym twice a day the whole week I am there. I enjoy the nice walk into the rest of Waikiki to people-watch near the crowds of Kalakaua Boulevard hotels and drop-in for a bite or beverage.But, my enjoyment of Prince Waikiki truly includes the nice, take-my-time walk to go past Alamoana Center to Walmart, Sam’s Club, Don Quixote and my catholic church (yes, I include Mass during my vacation).Prince Waikiki is for me and you will agree when you stay there. I always put a few dollars on my pillow to say thank you to the housekeeper for taking care of my room daily. Yes, it is their job; but in Hawaii, ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind. Just ask Lilo and Stitch. They’re from Alohaland.","Apia, Samoa","Patrick i</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Apia, Samoa</strong>",1,5.0

Regardless every room has an ocean view. The staff is friendly and courteous. You can easily walk to Kahanamoku Beach and all the way to Waikiki Beach or go in the opposite direction and hit up Ala Moana Beach. Get out of the sun for a while getting lost in Ala Moana Shopping Center and take back goodies from the poke bar at Foodland to put in your fridge for a quick snack. The two in-house restaurants are both excellent, although the last time I had the buffet in 2018 I felt the food quality had gone downhill slightly.

The hotel sparkles. It is clean, service is excellent and friendly at all levels. It has all of the comforts one would expect. The rooms are spacious and it seems that all have views of either the beach or Ala Moana harbor. The room had a fridge (empty, and no mini bar), drinking glasses (but only one paper coffee cup that was never replaced), coffee maker and hot pot. Amenities included soaps, shampoos, lotions by Malie, which had a nice soft tropical smell. Beds were comfortable and light fixtures and AC worked well (no calls to the front desk were needed!). Toilets are those Japanese toilets with built in bidets. The pools are on the 5th floor and overlook the beach and makes for nice sunset viewing. There is an adjacent bar. There are two restaurants--100 Sails, which is apparently a popular buffet for local and a Japanese sushi restaurant. There also a casual coffee shop and gift shops on the first floor. The location is convenient to the convention center and Ala Moana shopping center, although pedestrian access to both places is strange with the way the traffic lights and crosswalks are set up. Ala Moana beach and harbor are just a few yards away. Ala Moana beach is less crowded than Waikiki and great for families. Down sides are that the pool is located away from any beach (minor) and aside from the shopping center, the shops in the area are generally uninspiring (McD's, ABC store, Crazy Shirt and a few steak and chain restaurants).","San Francisco, California","mt188</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",89,5.0

I feel comfortable and welcomed by all of the staff members at this resort. When you step out of your car, the workers happily smile and welcome you, already starting off your vacation on the right foot. If you really want to experience Oahu in the best possible way, you should stay at Prince Waikiki.This was my first time going to Oahu in December, and I could not have picked a better month because the weather was absolutely perfect! Not too hot and not too cold, which is just the way I like it. On top of perfect weather, I could not have picked a better resort to stay at during this time. They had beautiful Christmas decorations at this time of year, with an outstanding Christmas tree right in front of the entrance. The rooms at Prince Waikiki are perfectly nice and cozy. If you want luxury at a reasonable price, this is the hotel to stay at. The beautiful ocean view rooms give you a wide window that you can open to see a one of a kind view. Peaceful and blissful, those are the two perfect words to describe the view and experience. On top of that, Prince Waikiki is set at a great location; walking distance to the Alo Moana center.Prince Waikiki also has a well known restaurant right inside of the hotel: 100 Sails. So technically saying breakfast, lunch, and dinner are available within steps of where you're staying. On weekends, they offer a delicious brunch and buffet menu. On the first floor, they also have an outstanding sushi restaurant named, Katsumidori, with some of the best tuna I've ever had. You can also find a coffee and acai bar, as long with a convenience store right on the first floor.My favorite part about Prince Waikiki, has got to be the pool area. They have an epic infinity pool, that looks even better during sunset. Cabanas are available for reservations and you can even enjoy your lunch or dinner in the pool section as well. The pool area is sheek and comfortable.In conclusion, if you are looking for luxury, peacefulness and convenience at a reasonable price, Prince Waikiki is the perfect hotel to stay at. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with your choice and will leave Prince Waikiki wishing that you never left.

From check-in onwards, the service was friendly, sincere, and flawless -- and this surprised me given that I was there at peak season, when hotel are at capacity and the likelihood of errors increases. Staff were always willing to help with a friendly Aloha and offer their expertise and advice. The room was spotless, updated, and had a perfect view of the marina. It was also bigger than expected, which was a nice surprise. The bathroom also had lots of space and modern features. My favourite -- and another super surprise -- was the Japanese toilet! This genuinely improved my well-being. If you've ever experienced a Japanese toilet, you will understand! :DThe location is slightly off ""the strip"" but this can be viewed as a either a bonus or a detriment, depending on your perspective. Being a bit further away from the main drag (ie. where the Moana Surfrider or Duke's statue is) means it's quieter, and also easier to get into the CBD if you are into art galleries, museums, and trendy restaurants like I am. However, it could also mean you're feeling a bit of FOMO if you're into the stereotypical Waikiki activity vibe, as once you hit the strip, you realize it is pretty crazy busy down there. Personally, maybe if i was visiting at a less busy time of year, I would prefer to be on the strip, but at peak holiday season, being a bit farther out was a benefit for me. It's a 25-30 min walk to that main drag, but the hotel's shuttle also is convenient (though I do wish it ran more often and later -- I ended up relying on Uber several times to get back). Overall, I have a hard time saying anything negative about this hotel. I struggle to think about staying anywhere else if I return to Waikiki! I'd like to suggest the designers put one more hanging hook in the bathroom -- given that you're likely to spend a lot of time at the beach and pool (which is also thumbs up btw) -- it would be great to have more space to hang damp towels and swimmers. On a related note, I'd like to suggest that the hot tub and infinity pool be adults-only... I was not happy about the splashing 5 year olds in both spaces. :(Other than those small things, I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel.

The staff from Door Man to Check-in to Concierge to Club hostesses are all friendly, smiling and helpful. We stayed at the Club room and it was quiet, roomy and well appointed. The best is the ocean front view with the most amazing sunset view. My wife really loves the blackout shade and the comfortable bed so she really enjoy a good night sleep every night. Bathroom was huge and full of nice amenities, particularly the heated toilet seat which my wife loves. As for the Club Lounge, the food quality is excellent and the drinks, including wine and beer, are plentiful. We found the lounge very relaxing as food and drinks are available from morning to late evening which really fit our mode of relaxed vacation. We tried the 100 Sails restaurant and food was also very good. We didn't tried the Japanese restaurant but it must be good as there are always lines waiting for dinner every night. The other good thing is the shuttle to Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki which is helpful after a long walk in the sun. Overall we have a wonderful experience in the hotel. My only comment is there is no find dining in the hotel like in Maui Prince and Room Service menu doesn't have any Asian dishes but still this is an excellent vacation to celebrate our anniversary.",,Raymond H,0,5.0

This was my third trip to Oahu and I was hesitant to stay here because it doesn’t open to a beach or have the open air areas that many other hotels have on the island. But I am thrilled we stayed here. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that truly made me feel like a guest. The entire staff was courteous and attentive. The renovations were beautiful and the room was pristine and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the in and out parking was super easy. For $35 a day we received the breakfast for two, parking, and other amenities. When we checked in and got to our room after a full day of travel we were too exhausted to move and so hungry. Within an hour of check in were were surprised with a knock on the door and complementary banana bread and fruit juice. Several days in we received a fruit basket in our room.

To our surprise not 5 minutes after submitting the survey we received a call from the front desk saying they had another room for us if we’d like to move!

I chose this hotel for its proximity to the Convention Centre and its high TripAdvisor rating. I was also considering the Modern and Equus hotels nearby, but after taking peeks at those hotels, was very glad I chose the Prince. It was an excellent hotel close to but a bit removed from the chaos of central Waikiki, and also close to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre.Service from the outset was universally friendly and accommodating. Check-in comes with a cool damp towel and a schedule for the hotel's shuttle, which can take you to the mall or to 2 drop-off points in Waikiki.The hotel has 2 almost identical 33-story towers (Ala Moana and Diamond Head). It seems all rooms have some sort of ocean view, with the quality of this view determining the room category and cost. I had either an Ocean Front Harbour or Ocean Front room on the 22nd floor of the Ala Moana (west) Tower. There were only 11 rooms on this floor. The floor-to-ceiling window overlooked the Ala Moana Yacht Harbour with the Pacific beyond. Looking straight down was the hotel's 5th floor rooftop pool area. To the left (east) was the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort's lagoon and beach. To the right (west) was Magic Island and the Ala Moana Regional Beach Park. I had a great view of fireworks from the Hilton lagoon one night. None of the rooms have lanais, but a portion of the window did completely open. Window shades (block-out or sun-reducing) were electronically controlled. There was Naio flower art painted on the walls. Outlets and USP ports were well placed. There was a convenient minifridge and bottled water replenished daily. The safe was actually a large drawer that had a lock. Wifi was free, included in the daily resort fee, which also included some things that were above normal, such as free self-parking, 2 welcome drinks, 20% off the buffet and golf (offsite).The bathroom was large, with an enclosed WC (Japanese Toto toilet that had bidet washing features but no drying feature), separate tub and stall shower. An oral hygiene and shaving kit are included with the resort fee.  The hotel has Club Level rooms on its highest floors, but the Club Lounge is actually located poolside. Also on the pool deck is the Hinana Bar (also serves light meals), the Muliwai Deck (outdoor space for private events) and the indoor fitness centre. There are 2 pools, one salt water, the other infinity-edged, plus a jacuzzi and cabanas.I did not try either of the hotel's restaurants. 100 Sails has buffet and a la carte menus. Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo's first location outside of Japan was here. There's also a coffee spot in the lobby. The lobby gift shop has a well-curated selection of items, plus sundries and snacks.

I could not have been more pleased! The hotel is perfectly located near Waikiki, and it has amazing views of the ocean. I highly recommend asking for an ocean view room if you can get one. Having just gotten off the cruise ship, we were looking for a simple, relaxing weekend in Honolulu. Due to the disembarkation schedule, we arrive at the hotel around 9am and thought we'd talk to the Front Desk. They couldn't have been nicer; they let me know that even though we were very early, they thought they could have a room ready by ~1000. They were happy to check our bags while we waited. In the meantime, we spoke to the concierge desk to arrange a tour for the day in the meantime, and they too were very accommodating. The room itself was fantastic, with automatic blinds that raise and lower at the touch of a button. There is also a fantastic pool/bar area on the 5th floor, and the pool area even includes a perimeter ""infinity pool"" overlooking the ocean. The turn-down service was spot-on (chocolates included!), and the bed was very comfortable. In the morning, I requested a late checkout due to a late flight schedule, and once again the front desk was very willing to hold our room until the early afternoon.

Magic Island is at the right forefront and Hilton Hawaiian Village lagoon to the left. As you enter the lobby, the interior space takes you away. Open, airy, with lots of light. I booked a club room on the higher level for my cousin, teenage niece and I to stay one night. We needed a late checkout, since my flight left at 10pm the next day. At check in, they immediately granted this request with a 6pm checkout. Then, we were escorted to the club lounge, where they had hosts greet us to give a tour of this amenity. In the club lounge, they serve hot and cold items, snacks, desserts, beverages, including beer and wine on tap. Good beer and wine too! There’s board games you can take to your room. There’s indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the sunset and harbor. The lounge connects you to the pools, bar, cabanas and loungers. The wow factor at the infinity pool is on high level at this point. It’s also a treat on Friday nights, you can see the fireworks from the pool area!We finally head to our room on the 31st floor. Wow factor just shot to infinity. You are greeted by floor to ceiling glass, overlooking the ocean and harbor below, and the windows open to let the trade wind breeze come in. After we peer away from the view, we check out the rest of the room, and they did not miss out on any details:USB & Electrical Outlets (bedside, on the table lamp, near tables/desks)BidetInfused Air Freshner SticksMalia Toiletries Drawer SafeMini RefrigeratorCoffee and TeaRobesSlippersFull Length MirrorWhen we turned the TV on, we were greeted by our names in the screen. And when it was time to lay our heads down for the night, we noticed the beds were turned down with a sweet note and chocolates. The beds, pillows and linen were so comfy, we slept in late.Lastly, I’d like to take the moment to rave about the hospitality we received from the Club room hosts, especially Marley. She was so sweet, and if she didn’t know the answer, she’d get it for you. This all ties back to my review title. They’ve all made me and my guests (local residents) feel welcomed. So much so, that I’m already thinking about making another visit, just so that I can stay at Prince Waikiki again.

My expectations were very high. The front desk staff were nice and accommodating but they didn’t go out of their way to make me feel any special. For example, I did expect the front desk person to walk me to the elevator as I noticed that other staff did that with families and couples. I wondered if there was a bias against solo travelers. My room was fabulous and clean but the walls could be thin. I was lucky to get a corner room and only had to deal with late-night noise from one side. The floor-to-ceiling Ocean Front Room is great but you would wish there was a balcony. I liked the modern fixtures and furnitures of the room. When I asked for housekeeping service the next morning and came back in the afternoon, they didn’t take away my room service dishes from the previous night and didn’t provide the two daily complimentary bottles of water in the fridge. I enjoyed the pool but it’s not heated so mornings are quite cold in the pool. The sliver of infinity pool was nice but it wasn’t clean. The water was very cloudy. I liked the self-parking lot which connected to the hotel lobby and mezzanine. I also liked the convenience store with Japanese and local products and Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby. My best experience here was in the new spa. I opted for the Hawaiian LomiLomi massage which was nice and worthwhile after a long day of outdoor activities. Overall, it’s all in the details for me and I hope that the service improves as the hotel tries to maintain its top status.

Every single staff member we encountered was very pleasant and helpful. The panoramic ocean view room was to die for, well appointed and spacious with a tub in the bathroom. Location between Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki was perfect. Very short walk to the Friday night fireworks at the Hilton. The infinity pool was beautiful but in need of draining. Lots of skin-looking floaties in there kept me out, unfortunately.We stayed next door at the Modern a few months ago and there is no comparison. The Modern is very beat up and although you have a nice view, a lanai, and a very, very spacious room, there is attention lost in the details. They need a thorough overhaul for that price point and I would gladly spend a little more for a room at the Prince that is perfect. This stay was during a very sad time and the Prince Waikiki was a peaceful and comfortable respite for me. My only wish was that there was a balcony but you only get those with suites.

The rooms are spectacular (chocolates left on the bed); the bathrooms have a bidet which was a new experience. I have traveled quite a bit and stayed in some exclusive hotels--the Prince Waikki exceeds them. The design and layout of the hotel is gorgeous as well as the many sitting areas. The buffet is delicious and well prepared. But what is most striking is the friendliness of the staff and the degree of service. A tip by one waitstaff person saved us hundreds of dollars. Also, the concierge service was so helpful in getting us a car rented for our last two days on the island. The staff seemed friendly, supportive and happy to work there.

We stayed here during what was going to be Hurricane Lane, and the staff were very supportive of all guests through all the uncertainty. The big point i wish to mention, which says a lot about the ethics of a hotel in what is typically a tourist rip off location, is that the hotel never once took advantage of guests during the hurricane. In comparison we had fiends staying at the Hawaiian Hilton village who were charged a ridiculous $49US p/p breakfast for the 2 days that guests were asked to stay inside the hotel. They had no choice but to pay as every cafe was closed outside the hotel due to the pending hurricane arrive. The Price Waikiki however, took the absolute opposite approach which i totally respect. They offered guests a $12.50 breakfast that almost mirrored the ridiculous Hilton offering. Well done Prince Waikiki, that is how you win customers for life. For readers tossing up between the Hilton and Prince Waikiki, like we were, go the Prince all the way. You can walk 8 mins down the road and use all the overcrowded Hilton facilities if you choose anyway..","Sydney, Australia","H8388AFdannyw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",24,5.0

They even have modern bidets on the toilets which is a underappreciated luxury that all hotels should provide. The main complaint I had with the visit was the unprofessional attitude of the bartender at the pool. He was rude, condescending and had several guests commenting on what a butt head he was. The two female servers we’re having to make excuses for him saying that he had to work extra shifts. Not our problem buddy.Overall, we had a great time.

Check in was relatively quick but impersonal but our room was available earlier than the advertised check in time, which was great.The room itself was very modern with beautiful views of marina, it had a comfortable double bed. Amenities in the bathroom were provided but basic.We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was a highlight of our stay; hot station with eggs cooked to order, lovely fresh fruit and juices, selection of Hawaiian sweets and a few Asian dishes. Service in the restaurant was fantastic and the restaurant was never too crowded or noisy. I would highly recommend using the restaurant for breakfast. It was a great start to each day.Hotel offers shuttle to other parts of Waikiki beach, we never used it as were happy to walk everywhere (the hotel is next door to Hilton complex and no more than 10 mins walk to the centre ofWaikiki beach) but it’s great for those who are in a hurry to get somewhere.The swimming pool was always crowded. There were a lot of families staying at the hotel and the kids made it very noisy, it was probably my least favourite part of the hotel. There were also no umbrellas to hide from the direct sun.Let me be clear, this is not a luxury hotel ( we stayed in Mandarin Oriental and Andaz during the rest of our trip) but neither is the price so the hotel is perfect if you are looking for a middle price hotel close to all the action. Overall we had a good stay but not entirely sure if we would stay here again. I would probably chose a more central location.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","patrycja212</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",239,4.0

There is a complementary shuttle to take guests to various shopping venues but I can't imagine not finding what you want at Ala Moana as it is huge. Everything about Prince Waikiki was first rate: the amenities, the infinity pool, the service...I can't think of anything to complain about.

Good: hotel room is newly renovated and it has great view of the marina. There are a lot of other details that make this hotel stand out. To give a few examples， the toilet seat is heated and fully automatic; our room offers both coffee machine and tea kettle; the blinds are also fully automated and has a few different privacy and blackout modes to choose from; room service was great. Things to improve: 1. Hotel shuttle was poorly organized. We arrived at the lobby first (around 310pm for the 325pm shuttle) but multiple groups of tourists jumped lined and got on the shuttle so we had to wait and eventually had to take a taxi. Although hotel pays for it but we had to wait for some time and people were still jumping lines for taxis. The doorman is not doing anything to prevent this from happening. 2 room 3013 is one room away from the elevator on the opposite side of it. It has significant amount of noise from the elevator room when the elevator is running. the noise is annoying and very loud in the middle of the night when someone is going to or calling for the elevator above our floor. It felt like someone was playing marble balls upstairs . As a result our sleeping schedule was reduced to 1am - 6am ish everyday. Please have someone come to the room and hear it. It is not something you would expect from a $400+ and best rated hotel on triparvisor. 3. Hotel had no beach and pool and fitness room is small. It only has one elliptical machine and at busy times I had to switch to treadmill for exercise. Overall if you are looking for a resort that has a beach and nice pool, we would pick rainbow tower (Hilton) that we stayed in four years ago. But if you want a nicer room and good service, I would recommend Prince Waikiki if they can improve their services.","Redmond, Washington","bgm109</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redmond, Washington</strong>",7,4.0

Upon arrival I exited shuttle bus and opened my own hotel door to gain access with no offer of assistance. Check in was no better with reception confirming name, taking card and giving me a welcome message in envelope before sending me on my way to room, in all of less than 10 words.The Ocean Front room itself was excellent with modern conveniences and floor to ceiling windows looking out over harbour. The delivery of a welcome fruit basket a few moments later was a pleasant surprise and almost made up for the arrival but it was just that, a welcome basket, as next day it was removed with still half its content left.Hotel for me was in a good location for the conference centre. It is only 5 minutes from being able to put feet in sand but does sit at top end of Waikiki. Main city area is a good 15 minute walk or shuttle/trolley ride.I did try to make use of concierge services but they seemed a little lacking in knowledge given I was after information on Neal S. Blaisdell Center, a major event location, but they didn't seem to know best way to get there and resorted to showing me Google map path.One of the saving features of the hotel is the onsite Honolulu Coffee Company, great for early morning pick me up and run by a very friendly team.My check out experience was no better with reception communicating even less, didn't even enquire as to my stay. Then I had to interrupt the door staff laughing between themselves to get help with bags.All in all an excellent hotel with poor front of house staff.

So I’ve summarised each part which you might be interested in. Arrival- Simply wonderful from the moment we arrived. Cases to our rooms instantly and a friendly welcome. The Room - wow!!! Simply stunning - just look at the pictures and let the view do the talking. Modern, elegant and perfect.The gym - never to busy and just what we wanted.The pool - lovely views of the harbour and the infirmity pool and the hot tub are bonus. The pool bar is great except if not a little expensive if you are not used to prices. How great would it be if they did a little happy hour for the sunset? The waitering staff were good but I would suggest that you get around to everyone (I know it’s hard) because some people felt left out. Restaurant - good. We ate breakfast through the express and formally and both were great. Pool bars food was good.Staff - kind, caring and always willing to go that extra mile. Sent us a few desserts to the room because we got engaged on Magic Island.Coffee house - brilliant place for a coffee, breakfast and chill in the Honolulu Coffee Company at reception. Location- a short stroll to the heart beat (or business) of Waikiki. Beaches to the left and beaches to the right. So quiet though - in the best possible way. You do feel like your out of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. It’s simple wonderful. Don’t worry about not having the hotel on the beach - it literally doesn’t matter.Overall, my self and my fiancé wanted to thank you for a truly unique and wonderful stay. This was our first trip to the island but certainly won’t be our last!!! Please see photos attached.

The room is modern with floor to ceiling windows. We opened the windows in the evening to hear the sound of the ocean waves.

Customer service is outstanding with everyone friendly and providing personalized service.I would stress that the Prince IS NOT a traditional Hawaiian beach mega resort. It is not an opulent design, doesn’t have heavily landscaped courtyards and multiple restaurants like other chain hotels on Waikiki. It is quiet,comfortable, provides great service and offers a better value to those who aren’t looking for the mega resort amenities.My wife and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary staying at the Prince and it worked perfectly for us.

I booked our stay as part of a package on Travelocity and in the notes/comments section, I requested a quiet room with a King bed. The lady checking us in the hotel asked me if a queen bed would be ok. (This room was on the 6th floor). I told her I would prefer a room with a King bed. She then put us in a room on the 8th floor of the Ala Moana tower. When we got into the room, we immediately noticed that there was a constant noice and chatter coming from the pool area below on the 5th floor even though our windows were closed. I thought back that the lady had originally wanted to put us on the 6th floor which would even be closer to the pool area and the noise from the pool area would possibly be greater. My frustration stems from the front desk checkin personnel not reading or accommodating us on our request for a quiet room. She was not cognizant that a room on a lower floor closer to the pool area would have noise coming from the pool area. Not every hotel guest staying at the hotel will be bothered by noise so if a guest specifically requests a quiet room, I think the checkin personnel should accommodate that.

We approached one of the ladies at the lounge and asked her to check us out. The whole checkout process took 20 minutes and there was no line! They tacked on fees that weren’t supposed to be there and the lady had to confer with the front desk to sort it out.

First off, the staff is AMAZING! From the check in staff to the staff on the pool deck, everyone was amazing. I spent the majority of my time during my stay at one of their ocean front cabanas. These can be rented for the day and are so worth every penny. Jenny, the pool deck bartender, was efficient and very tentative to my needs. She offered several specialty cocktails as well as lunch dishes. I tried the mushroom flatbread, taro chips, ahi poke, and sushi roll and each entree was to-die-for. Later that night, my parter and I enjoyed a private dinner overlooking the Honolulu docking area. I didn't get our server's name, but once again, we experienced the definition of luxury meeting 5 star service. I cannot rave enough about this place. Waikiki can feel hectic at times, but if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a couple days, this hotel has a convenient location, yet feels much more ""secluded"" than any other Waikiki hotel I've stayed at in the way that it feels much more quiet and laid-back from your typical tourist destination. 5 stars for Prince- I will definitely be back!",,Adrienne H,0,5.0

They were over the top attentive with cold, moist towels to soak up the blood as well as tending to wounds. The staff was beyond the call of duty responsive. JoAnn called Doctors on Call, they came to the Prince to tend to my wife, took her to their office, treated her wounds and returned her to the property. JoAnn had stated that she would pay for a Taxi from Doctors on Call if they could not deliver my wife back. Today everything is good, my wife is healing, life is settling back into a normal pace. It was amazing that a day or two later Mark was still checking on the well being of my bride. Upon check out I was able to personally thank these two all stars.

But it turns out that this is one of the worst hotels that I've ever stayed in and trust me, I've stayed in many. I started by booking the Ocean View room, which I was told would have a good view of the ocean. I requested a very high floor and a complementary upgrade to a larger room (I'm a rewards member) since in addition to being here for business for almost three weeks, I also brought my family along for Father's day and a birthday and wanted to make sure this super long stay in this hotel was a great memory. Unfortunately, it has not been that at all.When we checked in we were told that we did in fact get an upgrade to an ocean front room on the 6th floor, which if you've stayed here you know that is NOT a high floor. It's almost right over the lobby based on how the hotel is built. I asked for a higher floor and the lady told me none were available but that I had received a huge upgrade. So I said OK thanks and go to the room.We arrived to the room and to my surprise the room is right over the pool, almost on the same level. I could see people and they could see right into my room. I could also hear them very well. Additionally, the room was tel he exact same size as pre-upgraded ocean view room that we were originally booked for. In addition to the pool, the view also included the harbor filled with boats, and not the ocean. The room was also on sort of a weird a corner so you couldn't see anything to the right but a cement wall. So I called the front desk to confirm that this was in fact an upgraded bigger ocean front room and the guy said it was a harbor view and the same size as what I had originally booked. So I asked him to explain the difference between the upgrade and what I had originally and also why I had not been put on a higher floor. Especially because I was not originally supposed to have a harbor view, which is actually a downgrade. He couldn't explain the difference. So I think they overbooked this hotel and gave me what was left over and tried to make me believe I was getting a better deal, when in reality it was worse.I ended up being moved to the 10th floor, which is still not high when you take in consideration that the hotel goes up to about 33 floors! We actually went up to the 30th floor to see the difference of the view and it was night and day from what we have. It was a true ocean view. So I feel like they are doing some false advertising. Also we told them we needed a high floor not only for the view but also because we needed a quiet room since we have a baby.The room we have now that we were moved to on the 10th floor is exactly the same as the one on the 6th floor, they just moved us. We still see the boats and very little of the broader ocean and we still see the wall.Additionally, I've noticed that there has been random long strands hair that is not ours EVERYWHERE in this room and it's so gross! In the bed and all over the bathroom. The room also is not cleaned well. When you look in the mirror at the rim of the sink you see black gunk, so gross. And dirty mildew/mold in the shower and bathtub. The doors to the bathroom and shower are glass that is not cleaned often. And because they are glass, you definitely notice. Bottom line is the rooms need a serious deep clenaing. It is also super noisy. You can hear everything, especially because we are right by the elevators. It sounds like they are working on something or doing construction. They also had a false fire alarm yesterday and had people in a panic for no reason.The hotel is nothing special and the food is SUPER expensive even though is not that great. I got one small mushroom breakfast sandwich and it was $8! Avoid this place like the plague. We have tried everything to find another hotel but everything was sold out for our long stay or super expensive. We usually stay at the Marriott Ko Olina. Much nicer and they have lagoons. We can't wait to get out of here. This has ruined this long trip to Hawaii. Smh!",,Passenger543977,6,1.0

This was our first experience at a luxury hotel and they did not disappoint. We were able to check in around 8:30 in the morning which was greatly appreciated since we had parasailing at 10 a.m. We had booked the club floor room that gives you access to a lounge with fantastic amenities! We also paid for included breakfast with the room Upon our arrival, we were escorted to the 5th floor where our check-in would take place. We were greeted by professional men that took care of our luggage. I'm not very good with names, but I would like to thank the lady who did our check-in as she allowed us to have breakfast in the lounge while she was organizing everything for our stay in their system. She explained how we could get in the lounge with ease, also where the pool was (just outside the lounge), the gym (more on that later) and we were then guided to the elevator on our way to our room. A handwritten letter from the general manager was also given to us which is a lovely touch to the beginning of our stay. After opening the door to our room on the 32nd floor, our breath was taken away by the amazing view over the harbour and the ocean! The bell boy who brought our luggage explained everything there was to know about the room. That was greatly appreciated as we didn’t have to figure out anything on our own later. The VIP lounge located on the 5th floor next to the pool was phenomenal! They served a solid breakfast and we could enjoy it outside with a nice view over the harbour and the ocean. They served eggs, potatoes/hash browns, fruits, yoghurt and a variety of bread. The lounge was very quiet and relaxing. We loved spending some time by the pool! The lounge also served soup and hors-d’oeuvre throughout the day. Their pastries are awesome! The one thing we couldn't believe was when we left for 15minutes, came back and to our surprise... housekeeping had cleaned our room!!! Plus, they gave us a couple local chocolates (they did that both days we were there!!!). The entire hotel is so quiet, we slept like babies and found our stay to be very relaxing and perfect just before heading home. The rooms are exactly like the pictures you see (see for yourself here). Overall, the staff is amazing, and we can’t thank them enough for providing great customer service and being there for their guests.

We splurged on a penthouse Waikiki Club room and we're glad we did! Adjacent to the beautiful pool, the Club provides a hot breakfast, mid-day snacks that make a great light lunch, evening pupus and a nice assortment of beverages including craft draft beer and wine. You enjoy these treats in a private covered lanai overlooking the harbor or in an air-conditioned alcove. We didn't use them, but the Club is staffed with a personal concierge if you need dining reservations or tour bookings. If you're planning to spend most of your time in the hotel relaxing by the pool this is a great amenity.The spacious and luxurious room had an unobstructed panoramic view of the ocean and Ala Moana Beach Park. Lots of nice room amenities including a mini refrigerator, large safe, robes and slippers, Keurig coffeemaker and hot water pot. The five-star bathroom features a Toto washlet, one of Japan's greatest contributions to the world.The property is on the west end of Waikiki within easy walking distance of the Ala Moana shopping center, the convention center and Ala Moana Beach Park. While not on the beach it's a five minute walk to the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon (basically a huge saltwater pool) and the beach fronting the Hilton Hawaiian Hotel. It's a pleasant 20 to 30 minute walk along the beach to central Waikiki or you can catch the free hotel shuttle that runs throughout the day. The location is great for kama'aina that want to meet with family or friends as they won't have to drive into the heart of Waikiki.We had a delicious dinner at Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo. They use top quality fish and have unique presentations that we haven't had at other US sushi restaurants. While service was attentive they also feature tablet ordering at your table so that you can easily add something to your order when your server's not around.

I chose to stay at this location mainly because it was a little further away from the main Waikiki area. The hotel's immediate surroundings were nice and calm, and not packed with tourists like myself, haha. When we drove into the main Waikiki area, it was super crowded and not relaxing at all!The lobby is super gorgeous, and the staff at reception were so friendly and welcoming. We were given cold hand towels to freshen up and also received a hand-written note from the hotel manager, which I thought was a nice touch. We received a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 31st floor with an awesome ocean view. The room was clean, fresh and spacious, and the bathroom was quite large. We booked direct on their site, so we didn't have to pay the daily resort charge and also got free parking!There's a Honolulu Coffee Company right in their lobby, which was so convenient! We didn't receive drink vouchers like some other reviewers have mentioned though (maybe I missed them?). There was a Keurig machine in our room, with coffee cups, coffee pods and tea bags. There's also a mini-fridge, which came with 2 free bottles of Aloha water.The only slight hiccup we experienced was with parking - neither of our room keys worked when going in and out of the structure due to some issue they were experiencing with their system. But we were able to get a validated ticket to use and re-use, so it really wasn't a big deal. Parking spots were also easy to find.

My two favorite hotels are the Hawaiian Hilton Village and the Prince Waikiki. This year I stayed at the Prince for 10 glorious days.There are many advantages at this fine hotel. First the views from every floor overlooks the ocean. I stayed on the 11th floor but we were happy. The staff is extremely helpful and professional. The rooms are very clean and I love the remodel. Bathroom is nice with separate tub and shower. Even the toilet seats are warmed which I admit is nice.The hotel is the first turn in after heading west from the Ala Moana shopping center so you literally miss all the Waikiki traffic (a big plus). Freeway access is easy going virtually anywhere. They offer some great restaurants on-site with happy hour treats.The hotel is set up for business stay and have USB ports right by your bed so you can charge multiple devices while using them. It looks to be a favorite for airline pilots and stewardesses as well. Never a wait for the elevators which is a big plus (one of the things I disliked about the Hawaiian Hilton Village).Several things I missed was a microwave. Perhaps thats how they keep the rooms so clean? I enjoyed going out and eating anyways. Also they have limited drawer availability. In our room only one drawer was available (the others are the safe, bar, and coffee maker). Small price to pay.

The service upon check-in was fantastic and, even though we had arrived quite a bit early, they were able to find an open room. They were even kind enough to give us an upgraded, ocean-view room and they also had complimentary champagne and banana bread delivered to us for our honeymoon. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again when visiting Honolulu. Here are a few things we enjoyed about the hotel and we hope people find helpful:- The hotel itself is situated in a great location, with easy walking to restaurants, Waikiki beach, shops, etc. (they also have a complimentary shuttle, but we did not use this). We found the location, since it is not right on the beach, to be a bit quieter and relaxing. - There were fewer kids than we expected and from what we saw at other properties, which gave the hotel a more adult and tranquil vibe. - The pool area was great and we never found it too crowded. We opted to rent a private cabana for half a day, which we would definitely recommend. The cabana includes two drinks, two bottles of water, sunscreen, and a pizza that was big enough for two. We thought the price was actually a bit of a steal given that the cost of the individual items by themselves was just about the cost of the half day rental. Also, special thanks to Howard that helped us that day at the pool. He was incredibly friendly and provided great recommendations of places to eat and sites to see- The rooms were very clean and modern and had a very good sized bathroom with shower and tub. Our room did not have a balcony but the windows do open up enough to get a good breeze and hear the ocean- From a food situation, there are decent options on site such as: a convenient store that was not terribly overpriced and a coffee and snack bar that had a great acai smoothie / bowl. We would not recommend the onsite restaurant as we thought, for the price, there are better options around the city.","San Francisco, California","MrandMrsTomTom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",4,5.0

The great reviews and decent price point for what looked like such a nice hotel near Waikiki beach is what initially attracted me. The hotel sits near the top of Waikiki beach across from the docks . All the rooms have an ocean view out over the docks with spectacular views of the sunset (see pictures). The room was spacious and the bed and linens were very comfortable. The window opened up onto the docks so you could catch the ocean breeze in your room when you wanted. I would open it up when I woke up in the morning in particular and that was a nice feature. The room was pretty technologically advanced. There were remote operated shade and blackout curtains that kept the room pretty dark when you wanted it to be. The TV had Google Chromecast which was a feature I had not seen at a hotel before. With that, I was able to stream anything from my phone to the tv (Netflix, HBOGO, Hulu etc), which was a really nice option to have for before bed. But the most technologically advanced feature was the toilette seat. I’m not kidding. A lot of people may have been on one of these remote controlled toilette seats before but this was a first for me. It was heated, and had all sorts of different water jet cleaning settings, it was pretty crazy. The bathroom was in general pretty huge, which was also nice. Outside the nice room, the lobby was big and spacious. The hotel sits on the corner of marina so there isn’t much traffic getting in and out. Valet was very convenient and only $8 more a night than self park which is included in the resort fee. The resort fee also includes the WiFi and you get a couple of drink vouchers and a beach tote that actually came in handy for me. The lobby also had a Hawaiian Coffee shop that had great pour over options so you could try several of the great local coffee options. You could also grab an açaí bowl there in the morning for breakfast. I would steer clear of the sushi restaurant in the hotel though unless you are a really serious sushi eater. I was one of the only English speaking people in the restaurant, and thought I was going to be amazed. It was just very, very raw. I’m usually a big sushi fan and do fine with the omikase option at most places but I couldn’t even eat a lot of what was put in front of me. Back to the subject of the hotel, in terms of beach access it wasn’t a bad walk at all across the marina to Waikiki beach. The hotel runs shuttles but it isn’t worth waiting for I would say. Just walk! It is also not a bad walk over to the mall from the hotel. I would stay here again or The Modern if I was going to spend a little more.

However, we enjoy walking and the hotel did offer a free shuttle to a fair few different places, although we didn’t ever use it. Very close to the lagoon outside the Hilton which was an awesome place for our toddler to swim. He also LOVED the hotel pool.It is a quiet area where the hotel is, however, we were on level 12 (despite asking to be on a higher floor and quiet room), and it wasn’t noisy as such but if something loud happened on the streets - sirens, loud cars etc you could hear it. We had a few issues with room service, but the hotel dealt with these issues really well. Couldn’t be happier with the service we received. However it’s not an extensive room service menu - esp if you’re pregnant like me, and it wasn’t up to date. The hotel restaurant also doesn’t have many options aside from buffet. However, on our last day we ordered from the pool menu and it was awesome! No idea why the stuff on the pool menu isn’t on the room service but it really should be! So many better options on the pool menu and had we have realized we would’ve just gone and sat by the pool to order food. The menu to us was an issue because there isn’t anywhere really close by to go and get takeaway from.

THE STAFF: Though it feels a more appropriate to say family, the staff was so genuine and insanely accommodating. A special shoutout to our favorite bellman George and the most loving concierge woman I've ever met, Noelani. Everyone we came into contact with was great, but they really went the extra mile to make sure my family and I were taken care of.3. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: The location was ideal. A plethora of restaurants, shops, bars and the beach were all within walking distance. There's also live music everywhere, which I loved. 4.

We were out there almost every day even if it was overcast just to have a Mai Tai and take in the view. AND there's a jacuzzi. My sister, dad and I stayed for a week and honestly couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Oh! One last thing, you have to eat at their sushi restaurant Katsumidori. The fish was so fresh, it was our favorite meal of the trip.My family and I hold so many fond memories from Oahu and a great majority of them were with The Prince and their staff. It's honestly a no brainer. I hope you enjoy your time there as much as I did!​",,MirandaRaeMayo,0,5.0

This beautiful hotel stay was the result of our aircraft failure en route from Vancouver to Auckland, New Zealand. Our airline booked half (lucky us) the passengers for one and a half days, complete with food and beverage voucher.Unfortunately, due to the volume of incoming guests, our check in was quite lengthy, but the hotel staff walked through the throng with trays of banana and pineapple breads and cups of lime/lemon flavoured water. Once checked in, we were directed to our 32nd floor room. Entry to the room - WOW - what a beautiful suite and the VIEW - stunning - overlooking the marina and right down the beach and bays. You could count the surfers in the breakwater. The room was 6 star - so tastefully decorated and two of the picture windows (a wall of glass0 opened to give you an amazing vista. The two queen beds had gorgeous pillows and linen, and the room was so spacious and equipped with plenty of storage for clothing, full floor to ceiling wardrobes, desk and reclining chair and table. WiFi access was complimentary. The bathroom, was huge and to die for - marble everywhere, plenty of space for his/her toiletries, and it also had separate toilet and shower room which ran off the bathroom with opaque glass doors.This hotel has everything - restaurants, buffet, shops, dual access, and two gorgeous swimming pools (one infinity overlooking the marina/hotel entrance). Towels are provided and can also be taken one block away to the beach.Being at the Marina end of the boulevard meant we were one block away from the famous shopping centre (stroll of 10 minutes), trolleys were accessible and taxis plentiful.We slept like babies, dined like kings/queens, and breakfast was more than adequate.Please, treat yourself, if only one/two nights, to an a surreal experience in this hotel.

We live on island, in fact I was born here when the place was the old Kaiser Hospital, so I chose this hotel with that sense of nostalgia -- what an excellent choice for a 4d/3n staycation. Joanne at the lobby was so attentive and friendly, with great suggestions for dining choices. I was a bit put out to have to come back to the lobby because our card couldn't work to get into the parking garage, but Malaea took care of everything and was so welcoming. We wanted a room with a king bed because we were celebrating an anniversary, but unfortunately due to the holiday weekend, no room was available. But that didn't stop both Malaea and Joanne from making our weekend special. They set it up so when we got back from dinner, a bottle of Prosecco was on ice wand two glass flutes on the side were waiting for us in our room. What customer service! In fact, Malaea called the next day to say that a room opened up with a king bed and asked us if we would like to move into it! TOO GOOD! Did I mention the view? Our room had a view that spanned from Hilton Hawaiian Hotel to Magic Island--stunning! So much dining options to choose from -- 100 Sails Buffet in the hotel was scrumptious (see my review). Red Lobster, Outback Steakhouse are right next door, and down the street was McDonalds, Subway, and the best Indian restaurant on the island, Bombay Palace. We even walked a little way and came across a Chinese B/L/D buffet called Wok Kiki -- get it? Waikiki/Wok Kiki. And the hotel is so close to Ala Moana Shopping Center. You get the visitors and local experience in a very convenient and gorgeous location. The views, OMG the views! We will most definitely return here for our next staycation. If you're local, sign up to Prince Preferred so you can get emails of specials and promotions.

Sometimes they left an assortment of fruit in the fridge as a nice surprise or the complimentary custom molded chocolates would consist of a different Hawaiian creauture with a card explaining its significance to the islands. Just little details that made The Prince stand out from others. The resort also has a beautiful key hole pool aside an infinity pool that looks over the ocean. Poolside bar service is on point and the drinks are delicious. Consuming Mai Tai’s in that pool while watching the sun set will never get old. Parking was never an issue for us.

We discovered the Prince is Pet friendly and was more than accommodating to our Labrador. We’ve stayed here for years during certain events held at the Prince Waikiki, and it’s a huge improvement to an already great hotel and staff. The valets are all awesome at greeting and getting your car unpacked. The front desk is quick and efficient getting you checked in. The room is nicely upgraded, with chromecast’s so you can watch your Netflix and other streaming videos on the tv effortlessly. The floor to ceiling windows can still be opened to get fresh air, but they’ve added fully automated sheer and curtain blinds too. The toilets all have washlets now, previously only available in the suites. The in house toiletries have all been upgraded to local, green conscious sustainable products. If you forgot a usb block, no problem, all of the outlets now have usb plugs in the event you don’t have one, and they’re 5amps so they are fast charging for any of your electronics. This hotel is on the edge of Waikiki, so it is a quieter atmosphere compared to being on Kalakaua or Kuhio Avenues.

Do not be surprised by the fact that The Prince is not on the beach. There is a marina in front of the hotel, if you want beach your choices are to walk left to the Hilton lagoon area (fake beach or very rocky beach) or go right to Ala Moana public beach, which I consider a very nice, huge and typically uncrowded area with Magic Island protected swimming lagoon as well. If you want to see colorful and diverse folks this is the place. Must be safe because you see a lot of young beautiful gals our sunning by themselves, not that I would notice such things. So ! The Prince rooms are all ""view"" which to say the least is a wonderful view, the higher the better. You can watch the comings and goings of the boats and take in the vista. The very center rooms have unobstructed views, the ones left and right will have a restricted view but it doesn't really matter, the view is ""the view"". We had an end room by design as they tend to be the quiet rooms. Now the rooms, NO BALCONIES ! Unless you go the extra bucks for the suites, some of those rooms do have balconies. This area is expensive enough so we opted for a standard room, which do come equipped with large easy to open windows that allow for airflow and a sense of openness. Now would we rather have had a balcony to enjoy the evening, yes indeed but we spent most evenings in the pool area. Little tip the pool bar shuts down at 8:30 pm and you can ease into one of the cabanas which are quite lovely. The pool; one medium size one small infinity that boasts an impressive view. The pool can be completely overrun with screaming kids at times but what are you going to do, it's Hawaii. You want privacy you are going to have to go find it on a beach. The island is literally covered with amazing beaches so you will have to get out of the city. On the infinity pool, we noted it was pretty dirty one day with flotsam and jetsam circulating in the water...kinda gross but the main pool was spotless and then there is a shared hot tub. We personally don't do those, but other folks seemed to enjoy. Shade can be hard to come by if you need that, arrive early to grab the few places in the shade or shell out like $200 for a cabana :) The bar has good service, have to shout out Jenny who goes 1,000 miles an hour waiting on the whole busy area herself. She was always right there and super cheerful. Food is a limited menu but again arrived quickly in neat little boxes to keep it out of the sun. If you want to eat and drink out there, get out your checkbook, but again it's Hawaii people - and if you want cheaper then you will have to leave the hotel. On the staff each and every employee we interacted with was full of the Aloha spirit and I simply have nothing but positive interactions to take away from our visit. I was struck how maids would stop if you walked by, make eye contact and greet you warmly and sincerely. The hotel was recently renovated so it's still shiny. Rooms spacious, bathrooms as well. Parking is kind of funky you have to exit and enter on the 3rd floor go up or down stairs then an escalator to the lobby then over to your elevator. Not a huge deal but might be an issue for less mobile folks. In closing read the reviews folks and know what you are getting. The Prince is a top notch property but not in the center of town, so if you want out of the hustle and to be close to the big mall and public beaches (by the way ALL beaches on Oahu are public) then this is your hotel.

Any time a hotel is ranked #1 on TripAdvisor, how could you go wrong?In most respects, Prince Waikiki lives up to its reputation. It's nice and quiet - a bit far from the maddening crowds of the rest of Waikiki, but within walking distance of all the beautiful beaches. And it has excellent views overlooking the marina. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. There are two warnings:1) The breakfast was mediocre and overpriced, especially if you like to eat healthy and/or are vegetarian. I had the buffet, because I was really hungry, and there was almost nothing for a vegetarian to eat. (Mind you, I can eat eggs; I'm not vegan.) There's miso soup, and maybe a bit of tasteless fruit, as well as an omelette. But the quality is pretty awful for everything. And it costs nearly $40 for this!If you are going to stay at the Prince Waikiki (which I would recommend for the rooms), go have breakfast at the Modern Hotel next door. Their breakfast is outstanding! 2) You will pay far more than you expected - They charge outrageous resort fees each day, which includes ""amenities"" like self-parking - even if you don't have a car! It's ridiculous. I know that many places in Hawaii charge resort fees, but this is especially bad, when they are already charging a ton of money for rooms. It leaves a bad taste, especially when so much else about this hotel is excellent.","Los Angeles, CA","Alisco</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",119,4.0

They also do turn down service every night with chocolates and ice if needed.We paid for access to the club lounge which is situated next to the pool. We had breakfast there every day, always plenty of choice. Cereal, pastries, fruit, meats, cheese yoghurts, toast. Then a variety of hot choices that changed daily, scrambled eggs, omelette, mini quiches etc. Was always kept topped up and fresh. They also provide snacks throughout the day plus a large variety of soft drinks, tea, coffee and wine and beer. We definitely made the most of it.Pool area was always well maintained, it was never really very busy so never had any trouble getting a sun lounger.

Plenty on offer around the hotel, 10 mins to the shopping mall, a few chain restaurants 5 mins walk away. So plenty to do if you don’t want to go very far.Staff were all really friendly and very helpful. Door / bell staff never let you open a door yourself, got you a taxi quickly and great valet service. Reception and concierge team very helpful, booked us a hire car, confirmed trip details, gave us maps and tips and info on where to go around the island.

You can get something similar (authentic Hawaiian French toast or Hawaiian eggs Benedict for example) down the street for less at a place called Goofy's. What makes the hotel earn 5 stars was the concierge, especially Queenie, who helped us plan a birthday dinner.

If we could give ""half"" a score, I would have given it 3 1/2. The hotel location is very handy, within walking distance to Waikiki Beach (15-20mins) and Ala Moana Mall (5-10 mins). The rooms are what we consider on par with hotels of this calibre. It is clean and tidy. The carpet was a little worn. The check-in service was ok, and the porter (George) that brought our luggage up to the room was top notched. He got us transferred to another room to have better ocean view. He was very friendly and had great sense of humour. The pool area is pleasant, although the pools are a little small. The service around the pool was good.Although I get that it is common to charge a resort fee in Waikiki, I really don't understand what we are getting for this fee. The hotel explains that we get free wi-fi, tooth brush and shaving kit, a carry bag, 2 bottles of water each day, and parking for the resort fee, I thought for a hotel of this calibre most of them should be included in the nightly rate. As for the parking, there are not enough spaces. Out of the 3 nights we hired a car, only once we could find a park. We ended up parking at the Electric vehicle park one night because there were no other parks (by the way, there was a Tesla parked at a ""normal"" carpark) and had a sign on our windscreen next day saying that we were not authorised to park at this spot (out of 5 spots reserved for EV, there were no EV parked there). The following night we still could not find a park, so ended up paying to park on the street across the road. Reception told us we could park at another building 5 mins walk away, but we were leaving and did not want to have to carry our luggage down the road to another building.On our last night, the room below us was obviously having a party and was quite loud beyond midnight. The hotel staff did get this sorted quickly for us. Overall I think the hotel is good, and was a comfortable stay, but there is nothing to make us want to come back and stay here again.","Hamilton, New Zealand","952linusw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, New Zealand</strong>",20,3.0

Concierge service doesn’t constitute luxury. However, this hotel makes up for the lack of waterfalls and foliage in its customer service and location. Bellmen, front desk staff, concierge, and waitstaff were all genuinely nice people. Rooms very clean with spectacular views.100 Sails restaurant suited a purpose for a late meal and “included” daily breakfast. Would we pay 32.00 for the breakfast buffet had it not been included? No. Recommend ordering from the a la cart menu for all meals. Dinner we opted for seafood buffet but opted for the a la cart meal several days later. Buffet while varied was standard fare that was pretty in presentation but lacked true flavor? Location was a huge selling point. If you want to be away from the chaos, it can be achieved here. Main views and proximity to Ala Moana beach and park was shear perfection! Evening walks to the populated areas were then rewarded by the peaceful respite of the Prince. Sleeping with the windows open allowed us to hear the ocean waves without the bar scenes.Suggestions to management. 1)While there is not an adult only pool and there is no life guard on duty, and we found it quite disconcerting that parents would allow small children to wear water wings in the infinity pool where they would gleefully propel themselves from the immersed step to the edge of the pool giggling as the water wave spilled will force over the edge. Several times I gasped thinking the small child would potentially wash over the edge. And no the parent was not in the pool but on the deck. 2)While the pool staff was pleasant, none rounded for drinks but more importantly to clear chairs of used towels. Apparently people don’t know to clear their towels as a courtesy to the next guest but furthermore if no staff rounds, the options for seating is reduced.

My 7 mos pregnant wife and I had no problem walking to shops and restaurants in Waikiki. Also, Ala Moana Park and Beach is an even shorter walk and it is not to be missed. It's one of the nicest parks I've ever visited. We never took their shuttle but there's also that option.Staff: 5/5Check-in staff, pool staff, etc were all excellent.Amenities: 5/5Room was modern and comfortable.

It's super authentic, excellent japanese for less than some of the tourist traps in the area.Price: 3/5The price is reasonable and competitive with other hotels in Waikiki. However, I was really annoyed that a $30/night resort fee is added to the bill only when you arrive. I booked my stay with points and there was a sting to have to owe an additional $60+ dollars for my two nights. It's a dirty trick and the management should immediately stop doing this. Just raise your rates. It's ridiculous to say the fee includes things like a tooth brush and a tote bag.

This needs to be prefaced by saying that I am not easily impressed. Honolulu is by no means my dream destination, it is loud, crowded, and urban. I was not prepared for how wonderful an experience this property would provide. We did a one night stay, pre-cruise, and asked for both early check-in and late departure. The front desk staff in a huge, beautiful lobby were gracious and friendly, helping tremendously with our moods after a red-eye from Vegas. They shuffled things a bit and told us they could have a room ready to go in a couple of hours - exceptional work with their volume of visitors. We used our time to enjoy the buffet breakfast in the third floor restaurant and wander a bit. We got our room and we were supremely happy with view, the giant opening windows, and the layout. Then, you begin to notice the details. A great deal of thought has gone in to how best to make guests comfortable and predict then fulfill their needs. From charging ports to make-up mirrors, the room was well conceived and beautifully executed. We spent a few hours at the pool in a cabana (half a days rent included two cocktails and a large frozen pizza - the only thing I would suggest improvement upon). The pool staff were excellent! They are friendly, and very efficient at providing excellent service. Overall impression:This hotel strikes the perfect balance. It is elegant without gaudy, service is given with smiles that are genuine not mandatory, rooms are spacious but not wastefully, and the entire facility is both immaculate and in perfect condition. I would love to stay with them again, even though they are located at a destination that is not my personal favorite.

Crowds. Traffic. Noise. Crowded beaches. However, staying at the Prince has made Honolulu actually pleasant. We stumbled upon this hotel taking a walk around the marina where we were staying at another nearby hotel that was crawling with people and tourists. We made the switch.The Prince is a bit of peace and tranquility smack dab in the middle of Waikiki. I'm almost hesitant to write this review as the selfish part of me wants to keep this gem a secret. It's great to go to the lobby and get great coffee without lines a mile long. It's wonderful to go to 100 Sails restaurant to get a great cooked to order egg breakfast for $5 with a view of the ocean (no lines nor wait). It's a treat to not have to race to the pool at sunrise to secure a chair at the pool. No waiting forever for the elevators, either. The only downside to this hotel is that it is not directly on the beach as it is on the marina -- and that's assuming you're a beach person. However, it's fun to watch the boats. If you want the beach there is a park within a 5 minute or so walk toward the Ala Moana center. The beach there is calm, clean, and not nearly as crowded as the other Waikiki beaches. The staff got to know us on a first-name basis and made us feel very welcome. The 100 Sails Restaurant located within the hotel has the best happy hour ever with very affordable drinks and pupus that will not disappoint. They also have an encore happy hour later in the evening with live music on the weekends. Our basic room was spacious and comfortable with a smart layout. The pillows were perfect (always an indicator of sleep quality). There was never noise from other guests that we heard - very quiet. My only complaint, and I have to think really think about it, was the fitness center. For cardio there was only one treadmill and one stationary bicycle. It would be nice to have an eliptical and/or at least one more treadmill.

The rooms are modern and clean, the sea views are breathtaking, pool is nice, pity the weather was too windy many days for us to fully enjoy it.

Read somewhere that you have you book the club lounge for the entire stay but we were able to cancel it for the last few days no problem. Just another point of service - always going over and above. On check in we received a hand written card and banana bread. A few days later macaroons (yum!), and they also do a turn down service every night. It really is the small things that add value.

We have witnessed many physical changes at this hotel, but one thing that remained constant was the friendly, familiar faces and great attitudes of many of the staff. We recently had to make a last minute trip. My wife called to book our room and was told that she couldn’t make a reservation after 6:00PM local time. Weird policy, but just so you know. We ended up booking a room the day we arrived in Honolulu. That is perhaps when the issues began. We wanted a room with a king size bed. We were told they only had kings available in their “Premiere” or “Club” level, an upgrade in price. No problem. We figured the premiere level was adequate and agreed to the upgrade. When we arrived after a long work day, we pulled up to the front of the hotel. Oddly, there were no valets present. Not a big deal, but unusual. I parked my vehicle, got our bags out myself, checked in, and then returned to the vehicle. A cheerful valet greeted me and we worked everything out. Once we arrived at our room, we walked into a very nicely appointed room. Except, something seemed “off”. The room seemed oddly small. In the main room, there was only a king bed, the normal cabinets, desk, TV, and two chairs. But, there was no couch and table. The room just felt cramped. If you sign on to use the free Wi-Fi, they ask you to rate your check-in and experience thus far with the hotel. Unbeknownst to each other, both my wife and I gave honest – disappointing – reviews. Soon, I received a message on our room phone from someone assuring me that the room was indeed a Premiere room and that we just may not be familiar with the latest remodel. My wife ended up speaking with the manager and he was friendly, helpful, and surprised when my wife told him how small the room was. They suddenly realized that they had placed us in a “satellite” room next to a suite that could be used as an extra space for a larger family or for someone that just wanted to stretch out. To make up for the mistake, they moved us to a Club floor, a normal sized room with a king bed, and did all of that for us while we were at work. (We just had to pack up again and leave our bags.) When we arrived back at the hotel, we were greeted by a newly-remodeled room that was super clean, cheerful, and nicely appointed, including locally sourced soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotions. The beds were very comfortable and we finally had a nice sitting area in which we could stretch out. The floor to ceiling windows had electric sheers and shades. But more importantly, the view allowed us to look out at the marina below. We could watch surfers, sailboats, kayaks, fishermen, and yachts as they maneuvered the canal, the waves, and the ocean. We took advantage of the Club floor access – located on the 5th floor near the swimming pool. Again, the people there were super friendly. You can choose from great snacks/charcuterie/soup/fruit/chips/crackers, etc. You can help yourself to coffee, sodas, and water, and a host/hostess will pour you a decent wine or beer if you like. One of the nicest surprises for us was the discovery of a fabulous, authentic, Japanese sushi bar/restaurant located just down the hall from the front desk. We had worked late and, around 9PM dropped in. We were seated immediately at the sushi bar. The chefs were super friendly (a theme at this property), knowledgeable, talented, offered us suggestions, made whatever we asked for, and made our dining experience simply delightful. In fact, we were so pleased, we went there a second time on the night before we were scheduled to go home. Same great chefs, same great sushi, same great experience. Sorry for this long essay, but the bottom line is, this hotel is a wonderful, luxury hotel. It’s away from the crowds of Waikiki, yet within walking distance of the Ala Moana mall in one direction and the beaches of Waikiki in the other. Do not hesitate to book a room here, and the Club floor upgrade is worth it.","Villa Park, United States","stephengT7333NO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Villa Park, United States</strong>",3,5.0

However it was showing its age. The Prince underwent a major renovation last year which included feedback and participation by its long time staff and employees. We've always said the true reflection of a hotel is not only the loyalty of its return customers, but the heart is pumped by the loyalty of its staff.We've seen this demonstrated by the smiles of familiar faces from the bellmen and car attendants to the staff front desk and even the folks who answer the phone and work at the shops within the hotel.I experienced the benefits of the restoration on a visit in November, and was excited to share it with my wife on this February trip. The lobby is open and magnificent. Some of the art pieces were created by the staff. The rooms are magnificent with incredible ocean views. The color palette is updated and relaxing with double power blinds to allow a view even with the bright sunsets or total blockage. We noticed some subtle but welcome touches such as the deluxe Japanese heated toilet, and my wife loved the makeup mirror that lights automatically when approached at a certain distance.Gone is the Hakone restaurant, but in its place is the incredible Katsu Midori Sushi restaurant out of Tokyo which imports its fish, serving large generous portions at a surprisingly good price. It is located on the lobby level and replaced the smelly hair salon. The main dining room has been nicely updated with many tasty items for breakfast ala cart or on their buffet. Again it was so comforting to see many of the same staff who gave us a warm greeting.The pool and deck have received a welcome and refreshing facelift as well. The cute little bar is gone, and the quick breakfast snack shop has been changed, but we miss the croissant sandwiches.All in all, we couldn't be happier with the Prince where you are truly treated like Royalty.","Redondo Beach, California","DrWendellW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",70,5.0

Our first stay at this hotel and our first visit to OahuThe hotel underwent a significant renovation in the past 18 months and it shows. It is really, really schmick! They’ve paid great attention to detail. Paint, fittings, fixtures, it’s all great.Room: Stayed on 31st floor (there’s 33) due to opting in to the Prince Waikiki Club (more on this later). Rooms don’t have balconies/terraces, but don’t need them. Floor to ceiling widows with a huge double window that slides fully open more than makes up for it. The electric blinds are a nice luxury touch, too. Day bed built into the corner of room is also great. Bed super comfy & pillows are very nice. Bathroom is well done. Marble tiles/countertop dominate, with frosted glass cubicle doors for shower & toilet.Club: The space is great, with indoor & outdoor seating, overlooking the marina. Food & beverage range is good, although wine & beer are on-tap only & choice is limited here. Oddly, we were asked to return our dirty dishes & glasses to the servery, so that the staff could then clear them away. Would’ve thought with the extra price tag to use the Lounge that the staff might clear away my plates and glasses. Pool area is good, and lounges are available on a first come basis. There’s no shade available unless you rent one of the lanai’s - having to pay for shade is a bit cheeky.If you don’t have the need to be right in the thick of it at Waikiki (it’s a decent 20 minutes walk to central Waikiki) you could do a whole heap worse than stay at this great hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Guddy71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",12,4.0

We had flights, rental car and now needed a hotel. We booked at several places, each one had a flaw revealed during further investigation that caused us to move on. We finally looked closely at the Prince Waikiki. The reservation agent was great and pointed out several reasons to upgrade to the club level. This gave us access to a lounge where wine, beer and food was available all day long. Check in was easy and we were taken to one of the highest floors in the hotel. When the door opened there was incredible sunlight in the room. Luckily there was a wonderful shade system to control the glare and darken the room at night to sleep. It was late afternoon and we had just finished an 11 hour flight. We went down to the club room and enjoyed wine and beer and some food. We decided to crash for the night. Around 8:00 we were awakened by fireworks. Our view was perfect for the Friday night spectacle. The next night we attended an event at the hotel where local restaurants served small plates and there was live music. We upgraded to VIP to be guaranteed a seat and an early admission. While some of the food was tasty, there was no way this was worth the price. We left early. The entire stay was just perfect. Imagine returning to the hotel and have the valet parking people greet you by name and ask how your trip to .... was. They remembered!The pool is very nice, on the 5th floor. There is a main pool and an infinity pool overlooking the marina. There is a bar and the waitstaff were excellent. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel, but they were all busy.Everything about the stay was just perfect. Oh yea, the self cleaning toilet seats were amazing! Just push a button..

My stay at this luxurious hotel truly exceeded all my expectations. After staying at other beachfront hotels in Waikiki I was expecting another touristy, staff in your face resort. I couldn't stop smiling after arriving at the resort. The lovely staff are always there to help when you need them but non intrusive. I finally felt like I was on vacation, and have never slept so well.On our first night we were treated to a private cabana meal on the pool deck. The fish taco appetiser was the best fish taco I've ever eaten. From someone that has travelled all over the world including Mexico this is a big call. Just when I didn't think the meal could get better we had a light fresh healthy beetroot salad. A huge fan of healthy fresh salads, this had my taste buds watering with the perfect execution of flavours.My partner who loves his steak, looked like a kid opening presents at xmas as he devoured his steak and lobster combo main. My belly was in heaven with a perfectly cooked piece of fresh Ahi fish. Mmm mmm just thinking about it has me wondering when I can go back. The meal was completed with a traditional Hawaiian shave ice desert. A lovely light refreshing way to end a perfect night.Although our night wasn't quite complete and just got better... Following our meal we jumped into the infinity pool and then hot outdoor spa. Sipping champagne we enjoyed an incredible view of a sky filled with stars and a full moon. I loved that although the hotel was at full capacity the pool was empty. At other resorts I've stayed at, I don't even want to use the pool due to the crowds.The resort goes above and beyond in all amenities and services. The linen, bed robes, slippers, room light, plugs, wifi, television is all of the highest quality. We had fast wifi the entire trip and felt like royalty having lovely gifts and notes delivered to our room each evening. Do it.

Close to all the buzz and life of Waikiki but yet an island sanctuary, where you feel in your own little world.The place unlike other places I've stayed in Waikiki gives you an authentic rejuvenating Hawaiian experience. Prince Waikiki felt non-touristy and I loved how I could sleep with the windows open to hear the ocean. Other beachfront places I've stayed in Waikiki, I've had to sleep with windows and doors closed due to beach and bar noise pollution. I loved how the staff were always there when you needed them but not in your face. Helped me to finally relax into my Hawaiian holiday.On our first night we enjoyed a sunset dinner in a private cabana on the pool deck. Not only was the scenery and ambience incredible but the food and service exceptional. We ate fresh healthy mouth watering food under the stars, with outstanding non-intrusive service. The meal started with a fish taco appetiser. Beetroot salad followed as an entree. For the main I had beautiful fresh fish while my partner had steak and lobster. The meal finished in Hawaiian class with a decadent strawberry shaved ice dessert. We finished the night with a spa and swim under a full moon. It really doesn't get better then that. The resort goes above and beyond. At the end of each day we would come back to our room cleaned to perfection and every night we were given a gift. They don't take any shortcuts. Robes, slippers, linen, beds, pillows everything is of the highest quality. If you're wanting an authentic hawaiian experience in luxury close to everything but far enough to be able to relax, rejuvenate do it. Go. Visit this magical gem in the heart of hawaii.

It is said to include such things as wifi and the gym, shuttle bus and free parking. Most hotels in the US provide wifi, gym and a shuttle on a complimentary basis.

Prince Waikiki provided excellent service and accommodations to my every need. If you're going to visit Hawaii, you must do yourself a favor and stay at this hotel. The staff greets you as you enter with the greatest genuine smile. And as you leave, don't forget to ask the staff for beach towels and chairs! They will happily provide you with some for your daily activities.Inside their hotel and up the escalators hides an amazing restaurant, 100 Sails. Their menu selection is unique and gives you a taste of Hawaii. From their tropical drink menu to their seafood and salad selections. You can hangout by the pool, and order yourself some drinks by the bar. My favorite was the 'Prince Charming' cocktail, it is fruity with a kick. The pool deck had not one but two pools! One inner pool and one infinity pool facing the ocean. Book yourself a cabana and enjoy a full day on deck watching the sunset.To be honest, it was a little hard to leave the room because they had the best sunsets! You are directly in front of the ocean.

I always feel so welcomed when I enter this hotel, the staff are so friendly and always ready to help you when you need assistance. The second I step into this hotel, I instantly feel relaxed and at ease. The spacious lobby with high ceilings and outstanding pieces of art and design gives me feelings of comfort and luxury at the same time. When checking in, the concierge handed us welcome towels to cool down our faces and hands.Another reason I love this hotel are the beautiful rooms. I stayed in the stunning Ocean Front Suite which had a living room as long with a master bedroom and another ocean front room which connected from the other side. The view from this room is spectacular and once you open the wide windows, you can see the view of the dock and the beach as well. This suite is truly luxurious and I was really able to enjoy my vacation staying in this suite. On top of that, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I fell asleep in an instant.The hotel pool area is also one of the highlights of this hotel. My favorite is watching the sunset from the pool area, it is definitely a sight to see. The sky turns into cotton candy skies. I also love the design of the pool area. There are beautiful white cabanas surrounding the pool that you can reserve. We had the pleasure of enjoying lunch from 100 Sails in one of the cabanas and also enjoyed dinner at the pool deck as well. Another feature of the pool area is a stunning infinity pool along the side of the hotel. I love just hanging out in the infinity pool because you get an incredible view, just like the one I can see from my suite.As mentioned before, I had the pleasure of enjoying both lunch and dinner from 100 Sails (the hotel's main restaurant and bar) at the pool area and let me just say, I am never disappointed eating here. It was just as good as the last time eating here. For lunch we had poke (my fave!), octopus tacos, truffle fries, mushroom flatbread, and a baked brie. For dinner we had 5 courses. For our first course we had a seafood platter with Kona lobster, ahi, Kau'l shrimp, poached kona lobster, grilled tako legs with pesto. Everything on this plate was so delicious! I wanted more! For our second course we had beet salad. For our third course we had wagyu beef and black truffle ravioli. It was nothing like I've ever had before, but it was so tasty. For our fourth course we enjoyed a sous vide Colorado lamb with yukon gold puree, and glass potato chips. This dish was perfect. The chips had a nice crunch to it and went so well with the lamb. The fifth course was a chocolate raspberry mousse chocolate cake topped with raspberry meringue, raspberry coulis, chocolate sheet, chocolate twist, and freeze dried strawberry crumb. It was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life.","San Diego, California","amynguyen2019</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",3,5.0

(I'll try and attach a photo.) The front desk said that it's still technically ocean front and anything more is an upgrade. While disappointing, it didn't harm our stay. Otherwise, a wonderful time at a top-notch hotel that's far enough away from the hustle of Waikiki beach but close enough that you could walk to it if you wanted.

We were graciously welcomed and given a room on the 23rd floor in the Diamond Head tower. All rooms have a remarkable view of the marina and ocean, and spectacular sunsets. The room was incredibly comfortable, with excellent A/C (something we have had 'challenges' with in many other Oahu hotels) as well as a huge window which opens up to let the fresh air in. ) The large bathroom has a big comfortable soaking tub, and separate shower with an adjustable shower head and great water pressure. The bath supplies are by Maile, a luxury local brand. Tea kettle, glasses and coffee supplies as well as mini fridge are discreetly tucked in the bureau cabinets. Our king-bed room also had a sizable corner sofa and plenty of closet space complete with generously sized robes and terry slippers. The bed was comfortable and there was an extra pillow in the closet. Turn down service was nice to return to after dinner- a nice card with local nature facts and chocolates left on the bed, as well as a full ice bucket, and freshening up of the room. The decor is modern and up to date, in tasteful Hawaiian decor with neutral colors and subtle textures. I didn't try the coffee packets as the Honolulu Coffee Roaster co. has a cafe in the lobby where they sell outstanding coffee drinks. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant but it seemed to be popular. We had the dinner buffet (twice), at the 100 Sails restaurant which featured crab legs, prime rib, sashimi and many other delicious entrees. The service was great, and the food was amazing. Check in and check out both went smoothly and quickly, not too long of a wait. The lobby was spotless and gleaming, and had a really nice ambience with local art installations and plenty of light and space. The gym had some decent cardio machines and a lanai to relax on to enjoy fresh air after exercising. The swimming pools were pristine and gently heated, perfect for an early morning swim. Easy walk to Ala Moana beach park, and Ala Moana mall for shopping if thats your thing- we went for cheap lunches and quick meals when we weren't doing things in other areas of the island. There are shuttles available as well. This is a beautiful newly renovated hotel with amazing staff, I can't say enough positive things about what a great experience we had staying here.

So I happily booked the Prince again to see if it had lived up to the potential. Sadly, it didn't.The Good :The Prince is a lovely hotel that has some of the best views in Waikiki and coziest beds. The turn-down service is thoughtful, with chocolates accompanied by a note about the Hawaiian culture swapped out every pm (the one that talked about petroleum was a bit odd tho). The room decor is ls soothing, with modern furnishings, hand-painted wallpaper and multifunction Toto toilet/bidets.The Bad :The standard of morning housekeeping is bare minimum. I had hairs & sand leftover in my shower from the previous occupant when I checked-in. As an experiment, I didn't move or clean them and they remained for almost the entirety of my stay. One day I got back to my room at 3:00 to find it hadn't been touched; I called housekeeping and was accused(?!!) of having the Do Not Disturb sign out (it hadn't been). They then sent someone to quickly straighten up but really? I had out of the room since 8am...The concierges are among the least experienced I've ever encountered. When asked about new or different places, they were totally uninformed and was directed to the old standards. Heck, they still recommend cabs, not Lyft, Uber or even the very dependable TheBus. Luckily I know how/where to go so if you've been to Oahu before, don't depend on them.The Multi-Cultural :The Prince is booked by large Japanese tour groups, with the dominant guest population that. For me, no biggie but might be for others...Synopsis :Would I stay at the Prince again? Probably not. It didn't feel special, like it had on my last visit, and there was an air of resignation among the staff. The one exception would be Alicia, a housekeeper who had been on my floor previously; I was greeted with a warm ""welcome back"" by her and wish she had been assigned to my floor again.

Weeks ahead of the special day, my wife and daughter selected several different hotels offering Kama'aina (local) rates with ocean views to check out. The Prince Waikiki was the only one that went above and beyond in showing them one of the rooms and the hotel property, so we made a reservation.On the big day, we pulled up to the hotel and were warmly and promptly greeted by one of the hotel staff at the curb. I was given a ticket for valet parking, but when I said I was going to do self-parking there was no change whatsoever in the employee's demeanor as I had expected. He continued to help unloading our luggage and give me great instructions on getting to the garage and where to park.Upon check-in the desk, our reservation was in order and everything about the hotel's amenities including free shuttle service to nearby shopping and the beach were fully explained. We headed up to our room and were told our bags would follow shortly. About 15 minutes later, the bellman arrived with our luggage and the great service continued as he offered to show us how to operate the electric blinds and other features about the room.Our room had a great view of the Ala Wai Boat Harbor, Magic Island and the ocean. The windows even opened up to enjoy the fresh air. The room was well-stocked with personal amenities including bath robes. It had a separate bathtub and shower, refrigerator, large flat screen TV, and the bottom drawer of the dresser had a combination push-button lock that served as a safe at no charge.We did not make use of the hotel's onsite dining, but did frequent the pool and make use of the free shuttle service. Aside from a noisy guest in the adjacent room our first night, we had a great weekend stay. The hotel staff were very courteous and professional and the hotel room and common areas were exceptional.

I stayed in the hotel for 6 nights. Initially my room was on the diamond head tower and the view was just of harbor and some ocean. I was not impressed and shared the feedback. Immediately Claire from the lobby staff responded and offered me the room on the 21 floor of the ala Moana tower with much better view. She was kind enough to give the keys and told us to take time to move our things. They also offered a champagne as my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary during our stay. The rooms are clean. The bathrooms are big and luxury. Everything else is okay. There is a resort fee of $30 plus dollars for each day of your stay which includes self car parking and couple of water bottles/ day. If you don’t have a car you still have to pay the resort fee. Be prepared to pay $5 delivery fee and 17% surcharge for every inroom service. I really hope the staff gets the majority if not all of the 17% surcharge. For a bowl of rice be prepared to pay close to $10. I have stayed in many luxury resorts before but none have charged me for every small service. I really wanted to like this resort as I spent a lot of my hard earned money but in the end for the price the value isn’t great. ",,vayer90,3,3.0

I couldn't believe how breathtaking it was to look out over the marina at the sunset each evening, or to see the fireworks display over the water at night. The hotel's interior was clean, modern, and elegant. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you know this hotel is plush as the carpeted area is clearly cushioned by what must be memory foam padding. Your feet sink into the floor as though they've rested upon a cloud after a long day. The room was sparklingly clean, the bed was comfortable, and all of the room amenities you could need were at your fingertips. In lieu of a mini-bar, there is a mini-fridge which is more welcome to me as I can use it to store my preferred food and beverages. I had a problem using my TV, but within a few minutes of calling housekeeping to have someone assist me with it, a hotel maintenance worker arrived to reset the system and I was able to catch up on the latest episode of my favorite show. The front desk clerks were efficient, and able to answer every question I had, including how long it would take to arrive at the airport from the hotel so I could gauge my checkout time. The best part of my stay at Prince Waikiki was the service provided to me by the excellent chefs of 100 Sails. I have Celiac Disease which means I absolutely cannot eat gluten. Even slight cross contamination can make me sick. I spoke with a chef at the beginning of each meal, and they were able to adjust items on the menu, or create their own dishes tailored to my needs. I cannot being to tell them how grateful I am for their generosity with their time, and the care with which they fed me. I know a kitchen is a busy place as I have spent time in them myself, so their willingness to make something just for me was truly a gift. I will be back at this hotel again soon, and I look forward to my stay. If only all hotels could be as nice as the Prince Waikiki hotel.","Haiku, Hawaii","amandaonmaui</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haiku, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

We booked a two bedroom suite on the Club floor. Cheaper to book directly than through Costco! The Club was a private VIP lounge with breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks. The assigned concierge attended to our every need, including checkout. Everyday we had a peaceful breakfast with ocean view and an occasional rainbow. This included wine and beer. We also overlooked the pool. Nearly every room in the hotel enjoys what would have been an upgraded view at any other hotel. The pool is lovely and quiet, and the guests are all very polite.

Before arriving in Hawaii I had stayed at their Tokyo hotel and was equally disappointed. The Prince Hawaii was an okay hotel. Aside from the views, there was very little that had the hotel stand out. I paid for one of the highest level suites at the hotel and no one even took me up to the room and explained the features of the room such as the automated blinds. I spent 15 minutes one night just trying to figure out where the controls were.The pool area was not as nice as other hotels that I have stayed at in Hawaii and the hotel did not offer things on site such as snorkeling or paddle boarding, yet they still charged a $30+ per day resort fee, which didn't make sense.I was also frustrated because I was misquoted the cost of a private driver to pick me up from the airport. First they said that it would be $80, then the concierge called me back numerous times quoting different prices and the price I was finally charged was almost double the initial price and was not what was quoted.The driver who did wind up picking me up didn't even have water in the car.The floor to ceiling windows were nice in the room and did offer a wonderful view. I found some of the hotel staff to be warm and helpful, but unfortunately that was not the case with all of the staff. One highlight was that the hotel a few blocks away (the Hilton Village) offered free fireworks on Friday night, which were pretty great. There was also a cool club next door at the Modern.For the price I paid though and the type of hotel I thought I was staying at, I felt that the experience fell short of my expectations.","Los Angeles, California","passionwithpurpose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",232,3.0

No one offered to help take our bags when we checked in, but this was actually perfectly fine for us!The room (Ocean Harbour Room) was quite nice, with a large king sized bed and a decent sized bathroom (with separate shower and bath). The bed was so comfortable!!! Had a great sleep here! We were given a room on Floor 7, so we didn't have the great views some other reviewers spoke about. We were also overlooking the pool area, so you can hear kids laughing in the morning. Otherwise the room was nice and quiet.There's daily housekeeping (topping up your free 2 bottles of water) and evening turn-down services (offering chocolates, shaver, toothbrushes and a fabric bag). The pool is on Level 5 and overlooks the harbour (and a car park, so it's not breathtaking).Location-wise, it's not the best, about a 20 minute walk from the main Waikiki strip. It's close to the Ala Moana shopping centre though, about a 5 minute walk. But there is a Honolulu Coffee shop in the lobby and a small gift shop/convenience store which is handy. There's also an ABC Superette across the road.We booked direct on the Prince Waikiki website to save on the resort fee and have access to free parking in the adjoining multi-storey car park (not sure if you get that with other booking sites too, but that was one of the supposed selling points on booking direct). Free wi-fi is included as well.While it's a nice hotel and the service is great, I question whether it deserves to be the #1 hotel in Honolulu (as at October 2017) for location alone...","Perth, Australia","brown-and-cony</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",156,4.0

None can be better than Prince Waikiki--take it from someone who has traveled around the world and stayed in more than her share of hotels across the globe. Overall, here is what I loved about Prince: it not only offered what many other accommodations lack, it gives you far and away the best of that item. For example, let's talk about applying cosmetics or shaving. Many hotels don't give you a special mirror for this task. You have to lean over the sink in insufficient lighting and do your best. Prince not only has a wall-mounted makeup/shaving mirror, it has a light. Not only does it have a light, it's motion sensitive, so it turns on when the sensor registers that you've leaned into the mirror.Here's another: Prince smells good. The entire hotel is subtly fragrant in a way that surrounds you with and immerses you in the Hawaiian experience. One more: one entire wall of my room was windows overlooking the marina. Rather than pull-down shades, my capacious room had a mechanized, opaque linen-like shade that lowered and raised at the touch of a button.The breakfast buffet was ridiculously good. The coffee cup was never empty. In fact, the server appeared every time I took two swallows, to warm it up. I loaded my plate with fresh fruit and a made-to-order omelette, and then my server appeared with a plate of three taro pancakes I had not ordered. They were a delicious bonus for every diner. What can I say about the staff? Never have I done business with a group that was friendlier or more efficient. They went the extra mile in ways that evidenced true commitment to my having a flawless experience in their hotel and in Waikiki.

The staff every where was super pleasant; the breakfast wait staff particularly attentive and cheerful. The only disappointment was the evening small bite menu (and same goes for the in-room menu) that there were no fruit / cheese plate choices -- would have been so good with a glass of wine later at night!.

The lobby was bright and cheerful and had a wonderful light fragrance. we were given a room on floor 21 with an amazing view of the harbor and ocean. Floor to ceiling Windows. Heaven! The room and bathroom were sparkling clean and both were quite large. Shower pressure was excellent. Bed and pillows were very comfy.We thought the hotel location was a good choice for us. It is located at the west end of Wakikii away from from the major crowds and noise yet close enough to be lively. We could walk to several restaurants and a ABC store and McDonalds were a quick walk across the street for late night snacks. We used the hotels free shuttle bus to take us to the mall(actually close enough to walk) and also to downtown Wakikii to drop us at the Dukes statue to shop and eat at Dukes restaurant which is a must(reservations recommended), about a five minute walk from the shuttle drop off point. Restaurants at the Prince hotel cater to the Asian clientele so we ate elsewhere. Fireworks every Friday night set off by the Hilton Hawaiian village hotel can be easily seen from the harbor dock. We were told you can also see them from the hotels pool deck but we opted to walk out to the harbor and had a great viewing spot. Be aware that the Prince has no beach and the pool is located on the fifth floor. The infinity pool and pool area is very nice with a pool bar located nearby. We would definitely stay again. Loved the turndown service with chocolates left on the pillows. Nice touch Prince hotel. And special thanks to Chad who was always friendly and happy with wonderful ideas and helpful information at the entrance.

The Prince Waikiki is a great find among tourist-filled Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. We found a special rate that made this double room a relative bargain at just over 300. From the moment we entered the hotel we ran right into the Aloha Spirit. We were greeted by a welcoming ""Uncle"" who guided us to the check-in desk. The lobby (which I'm usually disinterested in) is gorgeous. Open, airy, with art that makes you smile and want to sit down just to look. Like our room on the 29th floor it is a statement in understated elegance. We'd considered a room on the 5th floor to be next to the ""rooftop"" infinity pool and spa tub. That would have been a poor decision. The best way to go is as high as possible. The views are truly breathtaking and we weren't even facing Diamond Head. Our room was simply beautiful; understated; with every convenience one might wish for. Beds superbly comfortable. Shower perfect for my 5' tall wife and my 6'2"" frame. We had a view of the marina off to the west with the mountains in the distance offered a breathtaking spectacle. Our two large windows open (yes, actually open easily) to the Honolulu air making it feel like we had a window to the gods (which we did). Electric black out drop curtain left us with an opaque view that was really nice. Coffee maker; safe; lovely furniture; bathroom with plenty of room and a Japanese style toilet (warm water spray; heated toilet seat....don't laugh...you'll want one installed at home immediately upon your return. Japanese engineers should be complemented on their genius...one size fits all!). Amenities of the finest quality shampoo, conditioner; and things only my wife understands. Our double room had a comfortable L-shaped couch facing the ocean windows. All very comfortable. My only negative is that the pool encounters strong winds much of the day that make it a bit uncomfortable to spend much time sitting at the pool although the pool itself was lovely. The room safe isn't the easiest to use. But the attention to detail and usability was superb. Nevertheless, the Aloha welcome attitude permeates the entire hotel and staff making it a lovely home away from home. That spirit as well as the incredibly comfortable room; away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki; a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, made it a perfect hotel for us. We will return to this super gem when we're next in Honolulu again.","Los Angeles, California","RobinRick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,5.0

Just a short walk from the Ala Moana Center, you have the luxury of being in Honolulu with controlled simplicity. Need not expect the crowded Waikiki Beach or swarms of tourists gathering onto buses. Go on runs in the morning along the marina and walk to the man-made cove. Enjoy fireworks every Friday and delight in their new lobby and infinity pool. The lobby has a Honolulu Coffee Company, which is the first hotel we stayed at that served Hawai’i coffee! There are two towers and make sure you ask which tower you’re in before you pretend to know where you’re going. The elevator ride up to your room is a treat itself. Revel in views of the city. A short Uber ride to the up and coming Kaka’Ako and the second oldest Chinatown in the U.S.Room: Newly renovated rooms are sleek coastal with incomparable views of the marina. There isn’t a balcony BUT they have two windows that open up that are more than sufficient. How much time are you spending in your room anyway?Food/Dining: We dined at 100 Sails for Brunch. Professional service with high-quality food. Espresso drinks available. Don’t leave without trying the Taro rolls.Tip: Don’t miss the fireworks on Friday.

They updated the rooms and the common areas -- the lobby and restaurants and pool area and did a fantastic job. We had a wonderful stay here. One reason we like it so much is that it never feels like there are a million people in the hotel. The infinity pool that was added is also a great addition to the hotel.

For those who wish to shop their the equivalent to New York's 5th Avenue on Kalakua Ave. As for excursions plan carefully there is so much to do volcano's visits, cultural, historic buildings of Honolulu, Chinatown what i will say not what you expect.

We stayed for a weekend and spent majority of our time at the pool deck and enjoying a variety of food and drinks from the Prince's new restaurant 100 Sails (the old Prince Court) and the Hinana Bar on the pool deck. I was so amazed at the renovations done throughout the entire hotel, especially to the pool deck. There is an infinity pool, a regular pool, and a Jacuzzi that are available for the whole family. There are also private cabanas available for purchase to have your own area for your family to sit and relax. My family and I stayed in a cabana for the entire weekend and we ordered tons of food. Everyone enjoyed all of the food, the pools, and the ambiance of the pool deck. At the Prince's new restaurant, 100 Sails, we had delicious food and the cocktails were the best that I have had in a long time. The buffet was also really good and I ate all the sushi that I could handle. If anyone is worried about the selection at the buffet, there are selections for everyone. For example, my mom dislikes seafood, but she was happy all of their salads, vegetables, and other selections. The bartenders at 100 Sails recommended drinks for me and I enjoyed them all, especially the Sail Away. My family was excited about the desserts and we also ordered shave ice for everyone to share. We had the same bartender and waitress at Hinana Bar during our stay and their service was always great!

As residents of Oahu having stayed in many of the Waikiki hotels - we didn't feel the need to be in the center of everything and chose the Prince after hearing about its recent renovations and reputation for oceanview rooms from every room. For the nightly rates offered at the Prince, the views alone were already a value. Oceanview rooms are typically a pretty penny in Waikiki. They live true to their promise - the views from the rooms (highlighted by floor to ceiling windows that can open) were amazing, where we watched sunsets every evening from the comfort of our rooms. The rooms themselves were decorated VERY nicely and the layout well done. The overall design touches and details of the hotel was carried through to each room — an expectation that is not always met where some hotels have impressive lobbies but disappointing room decor. Bathrooms were grand (in decor) with fancy Japanese-style toto-washlet toilets, separate showers and handwash/sink areas. Service was luxury-level — warm and friendly; very attentive but professional, we had noted that we were celebrating a birthday and upon our arrival, were surprised with beautifully plated desserts and refreshments, and a little totebag of useful everyday items. When we had inquired about a late-checkout, we were offered one as late as 6pm for no charge! Although the property is not beachfront, the design of the pool area makes it feel as if you are on the water. The deck design is reminiscent of being on a boat deck especially since it is situated overlooking the Ala Wai boat harbor. The layout is expansive, taking up the area between both hotel towers with plenty of lounge seating areas, a regular pool and a smaller infinity lap pool.When we were there, the hotel seemed calm and peaceful. We saw families, couples and some business travelers in the public areas. The public areas had plentiful seating that allowed for relaxing, reading and working so we saw several people working on their laptops.The actual location of the hotel was, in my opinion, convenient if you wanted a little bit of everything. It is next to the Ilikai hotel, at the edge of Waikiki. It was a 10-15 min walk to Fort deRussy Beach or into Waikiki center. Parking is included in the room rate and getting in and out of the hotel was easier than if you were in the middle of Waikiki bc of traffic. They also offer a shuttle service into Waikiki, their golf course and the Ala Moana shopping center. Ala Moana shopping center, however, is only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel so a shuttle is not necessary.For people who do not care to be in the middle of Waikiki or to deal with the Waikiki crowds, I would recommend this hotel thoroughly. It more than makes up for its location in a variety of ways and is a tremendous value. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.","Kailua, Hawaii","sylvialoha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",8,5.0

My wife and I recently stayed at this extravagant luxury hotel for our 10 year anniversary (sept 5&6). I will try to make it brief but there is so much to share........ Front door greeting.... Extremely polite, hospitable, alert and attentive to every guest. This includes Valet, Doorman, Concierge and even the General Mgr.......yes the GM was there EVERY DAY greeting Every Guest! Wow (See photo)Front Desk Check-in.....Lori Lei was the Best! She welcomed us, provided cold towels, inquired about us personally, placed us on top floor with the best view and provided input on fine dining. She then personally walked us over the concierge desk for additional support. Concierge complemented the information with brochures and all sorts of information.Room....... spectacular Oceanview with updated furniture and extremely clean. Beding smelled fresh and comfortable. Pillows.....to die for!Letter from GMCharles ""Chuck"" personally welcomed us and acknowledge our anniversary with the personal hand-written card. This too was personally delivered (slide under our door). Shortly there after they brought complementary champagne to our room....... talk about speechless! To be greeted at the desk announcing our anniversary was enough but to get a personal hand-written card from the GM along with champagne was incredible customer service!!Our overall experience was like a lifelong dream or fantasy for my wife and I. The entire staff from everyone we came in contact with at the front doors of the hotel up to our room; it felt like everyone knew us by name...

Enjoy a walk through The Magic Island and take a photo or video of the wonderful skycraper view along Ala Moana and the marina. As well as the magnificent Diamond Head. Along the end of the island is a wide lagoon stretch with white sand and a safe place for young kids as well as adults like me ( of course).

It was for our honeymoon and they greeted us with a nice card and received 2 small bottles of champagne which was a nice touch. Our room was on the 27th floor and had an ocean view. The room was very clean and spacious for a 1 bed and bathroom. My wife really liked the decor and it looked very elegant. The bathroom was also very spacious with a tub and separate shower and the toilet was sectioned off with its own door.The staff is very friendly. Multiple times as a bell boy would come out of the elevator and even though we were still far away from the elevator, they would hold it for us. The staff was very accommodating. We had a late flight out of Honolulu at 10pm and was given a late check out of 6pm. That was really nice of them, as normal check out times i believe is 12pm.The pool area is amazing. There is an infinity pool, separate pool for people who actually want to swim laps and a hot tub. My only wish is that the hot tub was larger. If there are more than 4 people in the hot tub it can seem a bit crammed. The view from the pool area are spectacular.The hotel has a daily resort fee of $30 which includes 2 bottles of water daily, coffee and tea in your room and if you are renting a car, there are lots of parking spots in their lot.We only have a few minor critiques with our stay which include soft pillows and the smell in the hotel lobby area is an acquired scent. Honestly it smelled like a mix of flowers and poop to put it mildly. The location was great. We were far away from the madness of Waikiki beach with all the hordes of tourist but close enough if you wanted to walk. The hotel provides free shuttle service to different spots close by. You are also a 5-10 min walk to Ala Moana Centre and 10 min walk to Magic Island beach.We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. I will say that Charts down the street was not very good and would recommend going. Overall we absolutely loved our stay here and will definitely be coming back.

The rooms and bathroom are beautiful. So clean and bright with the massive windows to see the views of the boat Harbour. You can see surfing for the room. The lobby area is lovely and staff are helpful and courteous. The pool is beautiful BUT the ambiance is not so good. I felt the pool area had no character. No trees or plants and absolutely no shade around the whatsoever. No umbrellas around to sit under so you are completely exposed to the harsh sun and the sun is very harsh over there. We went to get a cocktail at the pool on our first night of arrival and the man behind the bar was very rude and pushy. He was arrogant and not very courteous at all. After having that experience with this man I didn't like going to the pool cause he was there every day. We all tipped him lots but one afternoon I decided I didn't want toTip him, so the next time we went there he ignored us. He didn't make us feel welcome at all. This kinda spoiled the pool time for us ladies. The restaurant 100 sails was very expensive, the all you can eat cost $58 plus tax plus tips. I ordered the chicken which was $22 US and it was awful. So a bit disappointed there. The coffee shop in lobby was nice with nice staff. The location of the Prince is ok but if I ever go back to Hawaii (I won't) I will stay somewhere else.

I also liked that it was not right in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki Beach but still within walking distance. Easy to find and lovely greeting at the drive when handing our car over for valet parking. Check in was friendly smooth and fast and luggage came up with us. We were located on the 5th floor in room 513 which is on the same level as the gym and the pool area. Our room had a balcony that overlooked the pool deck and infinity pool area but with the double glazing there was very little noise heard. My initial thoughts was it was very closed in and small, the low ceilings made it feel boxy and I was surprised the rooms were smaller than they appear on the website. However we had just come from a very big Resort Suite in Maui so I figured this was why this felt small. The room was clean and comfortable. I found it difficult to sleep the first night as you can hear the lifts in the foyer and because of our room location there was slamming of the doors from the passage to the pool area where people were still coming and going after the area was closed. I found it a noisy room for our entire stay but as we were out all day every day and often not returning until 10pm each night, I did not ask to be moved. The staff both at reception, Honolulu Coffee Cafe located in the foyer (Fabulous coffee and snacks), and the valet staff were exceptional and so very helpful and caring. I could not fault their customer service and friendly conversation. I loved that it was a short walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and that it overlooked the Marina and was quieter in its location. I would recommend this if you don't want to be in the thick of it on Waikiki Beach. We would stay again and I would recommend but not be situated so close to the swimming pool area. My only complaint was on our last night we were woken at 1 to a loud industrial sound, and after a half an hour of this I got up and went to pool area and the night staff were cleaning the cement area with a large industrial cleaner. I informed that this was very disruptive to sleeping. I spoke to reception and they had the cleaning stopped immediately with apology.

I would not recommend paying anything extra to use the club lounge. We paid $100/night to use it, and didn't think it was worth that at all. We had imagined it being a larger space, where our child could play a bit, and where we could get nice food & drinks. Well although the staff in there are absolutely charming, the food in there no bueno. In typical Japanese fashion, the staff spent a great deal of time arranging the foods to present them nicely, but that doesn't change the quality of the food itself. You'll find better food in an airport lounge. There were a couple of beers on tap. and a small refrigerator with a few beverages. Small seating areas indoors and outdoors.

The Prince(our first time) was absolutely delightful and the price so reasonable for what we received in return. Our room was on the 33rd floor with a beautiful view of the marina and ocean beyond. We signed up for the Club Room which gave us access to a variety of foods(included in the cost of the room) from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. at night changing the variety 3 times a day. The food was varied and delicious and also they offered white and red wine.My husband commented on the peacefulness of the Club Room patio and we felt like we could stay there just for that. We had lunch twice at 100 Sails Restaurant buffet which was also outstanding with an extraordinary variety of foods for the most discerning palette. Our favorites were the Ahi Poke, tomatoes with mozzarella, handmade Sushi California roll, Clam Chowder, Shrimp and vegetable tempura, crispy garlic soy chicken, the noodle station plus so much more. The desserts we had each time we ate there(twice) was the bread pudding with vanilla sauce, the chocolate macadamia nut pie and the leche flan. KatsuMidori Sushi which is original Japanese cuisine harmonizes the flavors of Japan's four seasons with local Hawaiian ingredients to create an ultimate sushi experience. My favorite dish was Katsu Gozen which was reasonably priced at $19 plus the outstanding dessert, Anmitsu Ice Cream. A violinist played so beautifully in the lobby on our first night which added to our pleasure. All of the help in the hotel could not do enough for us and were there whenever we needed them. The front desk and the concierge were so professional.

I go to Hawaii every year since I have family here, and I usually alternate between the Hilton and the Hyatt - but now that I discovered the Prince Waikiki I'll stay at this hotel from now on. I stayed here for 7 nights earlier this month for a funeral, and I was pleasantly surprised. I booked an ""oceanfront"" room, which is on a higher floor than an ""oceanfront harbor"" room. I loved the view even though there wasn't a beach - but since my kids are grownup, being on the beach is no longer importanat. The room was clean and the cleaning ladies were very very nice. The concierge was excellent - she booked a helicopter tour for me for the same day I booked it. All the staff I encountered always greeted me with ""Good morning"" or ""Good afternoon"" and always asked if they could be of service. The Prince had much bigger and better bathrooms than either the Hilton or the Hyatt, and my shower was separate from the toilet and tub. Since the hotel was newly-renovated everything in the room was new. There were many electrical outlets in the room - enough for 3 people - which was convenient since I had my teenage daughter and spouse with me with all their electronic gadgets. Parking was also better and it was easier getting in and out of the parking structure. This was what surprised me the most since the hotel was right beside the very busy Ala Moana Blvd. Parking is included in the ""resort fee"" unlike other hotels where it is separate. IT WASN'T CROWDED HERE - which made for a more relaxing stay - and this was in the middle of the high season. This hotel is an easy walk to the Ala Moana shopping center. It's also an easy walk to the Hilton shops (just go around the Hilton fence on street level - don't go up the ramp to the Ilikai) if you want to buy cookies from the Honolulu Cookie company shop or coffee from the Kona Mountain Coffee shop. This hotel is right beside the Outback and Charthouse restaurants and also close to the Red Lobster - but I didn't eat there since I wanted authentic Hawaiian food.The gym was adequate and had new equipment. The business center had two computers and a printer - very convenient for printing vouchers or boarding passes. I didn't try the pools (one of them was under renovation) - but I never use pools that aren't mine anyway. We hosted a lunch at 100 Sails restaurant, which had a good lunch buffet, and service at the restaurant was excellent, just like everywhere else in this hotel.I really appreciated that the hotel gave me a late check-out at no extra charge, since I had a red-eye flight back to the mainland.I'm coming back in September for a vacation and I will definitely stay here again.

Even though we weren't on one of the high, high, floors, the view of the marina was lovely. Amenities like beverage service and coffee maker were tucked away so there were mostly clear surfaces. The separate toilet (WC) with cleansing, shower, and bathtub were luxe touches. Controls for the toilet and the automated blinds and windows were easy enough to figure out, although a card re: the windows and blinds would have been welcome. There were ample outlets for USB and regular plugs. Very nice robes and slippers, and the toiletries were pleasant and neutral, as opposed to the over-woodsy items some chains are using. The soaps were unusually nice, scrubby and moisturizing. Bedding was super-comfy and plenty of pillows on hand. There is a very comprehensive shop in the lobby that has snacks, drinks, OTC medicines, gifts...One of the nicest hotel shops I've seen. No need to make a CVS run! I wish I'd explored the coffee shop earlier...lots of great coffee offerings plus quiche, macaroons, all kinds of baked goods and healthy offerings. If I go back I'd eat a breakfast or two there. Everyone was friendly and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping. The restaurants I tried were tasty and I did like that there were a lot of set-off ""zones"" in the public areas if you needed to wait for others. The only quibble was the ac changing to a warmer-than-comfortable setting in the middle of the night (as so many places do). One phone call, though, got a nice oscillating fan brought to our room. All in all, a lovely setting, keeping us and other members of our party comfortable and happy. And when I needed to call a few days later about getting a receipt (not their fault at all) they gave great customer service and I had an emailed receipt within minutes.

The room was spotless upon arrival. It was well-appointed with everything I needed. The staff was super helpful. Everything went smoothly.Here are some of the highlights of my visit. I was coming into town for a conference. I arrived late at night. There was absolutely no line when I checked in. Two minutes later, I was in my room. Other attendees reported waiting in 30-45 minute lines to get checked in. Thank goodness that was not me.When I got to the room, I didn't see a coffee maker (actually wanted to make tea). The front desk was really helpful and agreed to send someone up right away. A couple minutes later, I found the tea-making device in a cabinet I had not checked. But they brought me a cup and some tea bags anyway, which was helpful.The room layout was pretty standard. Probably the best thing is the curtains, which are automated. There are two levels of darkness, so you can have some privacy or achieve complete blackout.The view from my room was fantastic. It looks out onto the harbor with lots of fancy boats, and a beautiful park, which I think is called Magic Island. It is definitely worth it to get the ocean view. If you wake up early (e.g., due to jet lag), you can see a beautiful sunrise over the boats, and at night, you can see the sunset over the park.The location was very convenient. It is about 10 minutes on foot to the convention center. It is about 10 minutes the other direction to the main restaurant area and downtown shopping.If you are thinking about a beach vacation, however, this might not be the best place for you, since you will need to walk down a ways to the beach by the Hilton (or possibly the other direction, though I did not go that way on the shore). Aside from the lack of beach, the only downside I noticed is a lack of storage space in the room. Although there is a big bureau in the room, all but one drawer is used by (fridge, safe, water glasses, coffee pot). If anyone from the hotel is reading this, I suggest consolidating the water and coffee into a single cabinet to give more space for clothes. Since I was alone, it was not a big deal, but a family of four would have a tough time finding a place for all their stuff.","San Francisco, California","dhuber23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",94,5.0

I believe all the hotel renovations are done and it looks great. More casual, open lobby; really different from any other hotel that I've stayed. I commented on the rooms earlier but to reiterate, well done but still a bit lacking in dresser space if you travel with lots of luggage/clothes that do not need to be in a closet - I travel light so what they have available is more than adequate. Have gotten use to the single cup coffee maker which is simple to use. Bottle water in the fridge is a plus as I use their new exercise room and always take one with me. 100 Sails Restaurant and Bar is a great place to spend the evening (I've only stayed in the bar area) and chat with their friendly staff although my last two visits, I only went to the Hinana Bar next to the exercise room for an early dinner and a couple of drinks. Know Tammy well since her Reef Lounge days and she's always great to chat with. Now I know that Howard is very knowledgeable about college football so I look forward to more conversations with him as the UH football season approaches. As a frequent visitor, being greeted by the staff on check-in and check-out makes you feel special, thanks Melodie and Pamie! Getting a welcome back card from the hotel manager is a nice touch as well as a complimentary banana bread that I received in my room. One of the main reasons I stay at the Prince Waikiki is for the self parking - only once in 12 years have I not found parking. But the main reason I stay at the Prince is the staff; they've have got to be amongst the best in the State of Hawai`i.

Seriously, we left the room once and came right back since we forgot an item, and they had already serviced out room, complete with chocolates next to the bed. Every toiletry was replaced religiously. The Club Room next to the pool is a great added value. Free snacks all day, hot breakfast and dinner, and free sodas, wine and beer all day.

The infinity pool is really nice with a view of the harbor and ocean, while the main pool is lovely as well.

The views are amazing but be sure to ask for a high floor as we were placed in a room on level 6 which suffered from traffic noise early in the morning. After we requested a new room we were placed on level 11 which was much better. The room has no items in the minibar so be sure to bring your own snacks and drinks. There is a small convenience store in the lobby for emergencies and the hotel is walking distance from a major shopping centre..Ala Moana. There is also a shuttle taking you downtown which is handy.

Someone opened my car door (sometimes at valet service they wait until the driver opens their door - at least in my experience), there was another person that greeted us again and opened the door to the hotel, and once in there as we headed towards the front desk we were greeted by the GM, Randi Fernandez and a staff of her managers. I haven't had that type of welcome at any hotel. This was the weekend of Hokule'a Homecoming, June 2017 so we were expecting a very busy and lengthy check-in, but it took less than 5 minutes. Pammy at the front desk provided excellent customer service and we were in our room in no time. Our room was amazing and perfect for viewing Hokule'a and the other wa'a that accompanied her during the homecoming. The room was very spacious and comfortable as were those soft beds. I really like how there was a separate shower and tub, works perfect for families that need to get ready at the same time! I also liked the automatic blinds - two different ones - but I especially liked the black out one when I needed to sleep in one morning!The infinity pool was fantastic with ample pool seating and available cabanas if you wanted to rent one for 1/2 day or a full day. The pool staff was very nice and had a great way of making sure all of the children were safe while still having lots of fun! You are in Waikiki but we didn't really feel like it, which was perfect.

From the moment we walked in and were greeted by their warm staff we knew we had made the right decision when choosing a hotel to stay at in Waikiki.ROOMSBeautifully appointed, we have seen some nice renovations in our travels but these rooms are so spacious and comfortable. We had more than enough space for our family of four. The bathrooms are large with separate soaking tub and shower which was great when we had to get our little family moving! Rooms included robes and slippers which were a nice touch. The mini fridge was perfect to keep our kids water and milk cold and snacks to keep them happy throughout our stay. The coffee set up was a special treat, definitely an upgraded presentation than your normal in room coffee amenity. The view from our room was spectacular but when we needed to get some rest, the automatic blinds, both a semi and full black out options were great.RESTAURANTSWe had the dinner buffet at 100 Sails the first night and couldn't have been more pleased. The selection was outstanding, you can tell the buffet lines had been recently redone and provided a great way to showcase all of the delectable offerings. In fact the entire restaurant looked brand new, with an upscale nautical theme to match the unbelievable views of the boat harbor and Pacific Ocean below. Our favorites were the sushi chef hand rolling sushi, fresh island fish and the prime rib and crab. There were also some very nice vegetarian options and beautiful fresh fruit and local salads.Breakfast was at the Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby where they made our children hot cocoa (even though it wasn't on the menu) and lovely pineapple scones and yogurt parfait, a great way to start the morning. Not to mention, probably the best cup of coffee I have had in a while.We had lunch one day at the new sushi restaurant on property, Katsu Midori, which we heard was the hottest new Japanese restaurant on the island. For lunch, they had a very reasonable lunch special ($18.50) and a kids menu that made our kids want to come back the next day. We were staying in the tower where this restaurant was, and could tell it was extremely popular, there were lines of people waiting to get in, make a reservation before you get there to make sure you can get in!POOLTheir brand new pool area was relaxing and has to have some of the best views! There are more enough chairs for everyone, as well as these great cabanas you can rent and enjoy your day poolside. The staff from the bar are constantly checking on you, even tried some fun cocktails from their recommendations. There is an infinity pool that runs along the edge of the building that is the perfect depth (about 3 feet) to enjoy a soak and watch the sunset (and fireworks on a Friday night).LOCATIONCouldn't ask for a better location! We were within walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center (largest mall) and the Hawaii Convention Center but also so convenient to all of the dining options in Waikiki.STAFFThe staff could not do enough for you. There was always a friendly face saying ""Aloha"" and asking if we needed anything. I always judge a hotel staff on how friendly the valets and room attendants are and everyone from the minute you walk in the property to each staff member you see walking around has a friendly demeanor.

It is now called the Prince Waikiki. Formerly it was called the Hawaii Prince Hotel. We've stayed here on several occasions over the past several years and it has gone through a few 'renovations'. Our anniversary is in early June which is when we usually book it. It is at the beginning / edge of Waikiki, within a five minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, the world's largest open air shopping center. The hotel is virtually adjacent to Ala Moana Beach Park, a nice park with a great beach and lagoon. The hotel also has a FREE shuttle that will drop you at Ala Moana Center and then makes two more stops in Waikiki. It used run till 10:30 pm. but now it runs from noon till around 7:30 pm. If you like walking it is a nice walk to the heart of Waikiki with many things to see and many photo ops.The hotel has again been recently renovated and this time, for the best. We've stayed after the previous renovation but it didn't look like much of a renovation ~ new carpet and flat screen tv. This renovation is a lot better. • Automatic, floor to ceiling block out and filtered blinds• HUGE flat screen tv with DVD, smart phone to tv capability• FREE wi-fi that actually works and is fast• New modern furniture• Two free bottles of water daily• In room Coffee and tea• A decent FREE amenity bag with shaving kit, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.• Upgraded bath supplies• Nightly turndown service with a momento As well the standard in-room safe, house slippers, bath robes, etc.The reception staff is great, too. Laura helped us check in and explained the new changes from the employee created artwork in the lobby to the new room packet. Being the 'first-face' of the hotel, Laura and Natsuki created a relaxed atmosphere form the get go.Being that is was out anniversary, after being out all day, it was a pleasant surprise to find Tuxedo Strawberries, bottles of wine and a bottle of champagne, upon our return to our air conditioned room. BTW, each room overlooks the ocean and the yacht harbor where the opening scene of Gilligan's Island was shot.The hotel has a coffee shop in the lobby, a bar, a poolside snackbar but only two restaurants. We had dinner at the Japanese restaurant, Katsumidori. I am an experienced Japanese foodie and this restaurant has excellent Japanese food. I highly recommend it.Although there are families that stay, the hotel doesn't really have any family activities with the exception of the pool/infinity pool.Lastly, the fitness center has been upgraded with great equipment, has been expanded in square footage but still a little cramped.Looking forward to our next stay ~ which will be sooner than next June. :-)","Honolulu, Hawaii","masterspiece</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",9,5.0

It was beyond my expectations and I couldn't have stayed at a better hotel. It was just newly renovated and let me tell you, it is a sight to see. First off, the location of this hotel was spectacular. I had a beautiful view of the Ala Wai Harbor and woke up to the view everyday. I was even able to open the windows and breathe the fresh air. Although it is not located at downtown Waikiki, this location was much better because it was so peaceful I was able to enjoy the vacation like I wanted to and relax. To add, the hotel is walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center and many amazing restaurants. If you did want to go to downtown Waikiki, it is less than a 10 min. drive. Second, the hotel staff were so friendly and nice, it made my experience a million times better. Everyone had a smile on the face and never said no when I needed assistance. Third, the newly renovated hotel rooms and pool area really made this hotel a jewel. The cabanas were luxurious and there was even an Infiniti pool! The bedrooms had class and style and I woke up feeling amazing everyday! Lastly, I went to the restaurant at the hotel 100 Sails for brunch and the food was spectacular! I tried a taro bun wagyu burger which completely blew my mind! It was so good! Also, I tried the Korean style cauliflower (KFC) which I couldn't believe it was cauliflower because the flavors exploded in my mouth. I ate four of them! I would definitely recommend eating at 100 Sails restaurant during your stay. Brunch also included a full buffet, which offered a wide variety of foods and each dish was flavorful and made to its full potential!

So many new touches can be found all over the property from cold towels on arrival, new art, new dining/menu, fitness center and welcome gifts that are included in the resort fee. Service has always been great but even with this change, you can see the difference. Opening doors, using our name, eye contact, acknowledgement and meeting our needs. Everything was above our expectations. Oh and we can't forget the pools with the added new infinity pool, chairs, cabana's and ocean front cabana and the pool service, yes . . . all awesome! We will need to check out the Prince Club, located next to the pool on our next visit. The rooms, perfect . . . setup/decor all blended in very well.

In Honolulu, we stayed at the Prince Waikiki, which ended our trip on a five star note. THE ROOMThe Prince only has south-facing rooms with floor to ceiling windows to ensure that each room has a fantastic ocean and harbour view.The room is clean, tasteful, and has many neat gadgets including automatic blackout rollershades and a TOTO bidet. We stayed in a standard room with two queen-sized beds covered by silky bamboo sheets. The wallpaper has a romantic Japanese-style texture and print. There is a large flat screen TV, AC, and modern safe. We particularly loved the renovated marble and tiled bathrooms. The shower and the toilet are enclosed behind two separate frosted glass doors. My wife was fond of the SimpleHuman makeup mirror. THE STAFFWhat makes the Prince stand out the most is their professional, friendly staff. They were always available to provide first class service. They can be reached through phone, internet, or in person and are always quick to respond. We received a personalized anniversary note and gift from the Prince management and the maid always leaves Hawaii themed chocolates after the turndown service. The management at the Prince is professional and accommodating. We had a late night flight on our last day and they were able to accommodate extended hours for us in the room. THE CLUBWe opted to have access to the more exclusive poolside club lounge. The club is a quiet hidden gem where you can have beer on tap and watch the sunset. There, you can also find a hot breakfast, appetizers, and hot entree for dinner.THE LOCATIONThe Prince is located on the West side of Waikiki, in the coveted beachfront neighborhood of Honolulu close to the beach and the shopping district. THE AMENITIESTwo pools are on the 5th floor: a large swimming pool and an infinity pool. There is also a hot tub. A 24-hour gym is available on the 5th floor. The gym has treadmills, an elliptical, weights, universal, etc. Cold water and fresh towels are available in the gym.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Prince and would highly recommend it to couples seeking a modern, luxury hotel with professional and responsive management that will exceed your expectations.","Vancouver, Canada","Vandanwood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

The lobby coffee shop serves great lattes.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like a calm and inviting environment on Waikiki. The one thing I would advise is that the hotel is located at the very beginning of Waikiki, so it is about a .8 mile walk to the heart of Waikiki. We did not find that to be a problem in the least and enjoyed both the opportunity to walk and the chance to get out of the throngs of people there. In short, I highly recommend a stay here.

My wife and I had stayed here over 15 years ago when it was the Hawaii Prince Hotel Waikiki. What an amazing transformation.Arriving on Friday night after work, parking was easy and we were treated to an unexpected welcome surprise of the front row fireworks display right above the harbor (Hilton Lagoon on Fridays). When we checked in, the staff told us about the cool new sculpture installation overhead. Our beautifully designed suite on the 30th floor was very tastefully furnished with a living room area, dining area and humungous bathroom. The room was prepared with a few amenities which we had requested when we made reservations. And because it was dark when we arrived, we didn't fully appreciate the floor-to-ceiling ocean view until we woke the next morning. My stunned daughter simply said ""whoa."" (Bonus points for the motorized window shades in every room, her favorite feature.)We met friends for dinner at the newly renovated 100 Sails Restaurant (formerly the Prince Court) and we chose the buffet: light years ahead of what I remember from the previous restaurant's offering. Prime rib station, sushi station, plenty of fresh seafood and excellent desserts. Go for it.We also had the upgraded Club Lounge access during our stay - most definitely worth it, especially traveling with family. Key card access to a private indoor/outdoor area overlooking the pool / harbor gives you unlimited access to hot and cold food items during breakfast hours, and additional food and snack offerings after 4pm. All this with coffee/tea, bottled cold beverages plus beer + wine on tap at all times? I'm positive I spent more waking hours at the lounge than I did in our room.The newly renovated pool and jacuzzi area were great but my daughter could not get enough of the new infinity pool. While it's not huge, it's pretty dramatic, curving and overlooking the harbor and ocean view.We were also there for an event in Waikiki and this location proved to be ideal - close to everything but quiet and ultra convenient to the shops at Ala Moana and Ward.On our last day while hanging out at the Club Lounge, a staff member overheard us talking about a late check out, and he offered to make it happen. He was able to take our room cards and re-key them right there in the lounge, and gave us WAY more time than we had asked for. No need to rush back to the room early to shower and change, we got to relax and extend our staycation a little longer.Highly recommend this place, and especially the Club Lounge access!","Kailua, Hawaii","808Bernie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

This hotel is in a great location right on the Honolulu marina and within walking distance to the conference center and to Waikiki restaurants. The hotel was recently renovated. I had a room on a high floor with great ocean views. The bed was super comfortable and the room was squeaky clean. I asked for a late check-out and was offered this for free until 6 pm on the day of departure. Kudos to the hotel for this! However, there were a few minor annoyances: 1) it is not possible to charge food and drinks from the coffee place in the lobby to the room; 2) the gym is rather small; 3) the elevators can take a long time to arrive. Overall I certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again when in Honolulu.","Utrecht, The Netherlands","Dutch_Freq_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Utrecht, The Netherlands</strong>",13,4.0

The Prince is perfectly located at the edge of Waikiki so it's much quieter than the hotels on Kalakaua Ave and it's super close to Ala Moana Mall.Top notch service from the staff was appreciated. Rooms were very modern and simple, but in an elegant way. Nice finishes and tasteful details. One of my favorites was that you can fully open your windows, no screen, nothing...just fresh Hawaiian air. Hard to imagine without actually being in the room but to be 26 floors up with a stunning view through open window was phenomenal. Having a 4-year old daughter, we spent lots of time at the pool. While the pool isn't deep (only about 4 feet max) it was more than enough to fully immerse yourself and I honestly didn't feel like I needed deeper. The infinity pool overlooking the marina is a nice touch as well. We upgraded to access the private lounge near the pool with drinks and light foods served all day long. For kids, this is perfect...easy snacks to keep them in a good mood. Totally worth the extra fee as beer and wine are on tap. Overall, this was the first time at the Prince and I will definitely return and recommend it to visiting family.","Kailua, Hawaii","832jesse</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

Waking up to the harbor and park views was spectacular and the window shades are great for the evening. I really can't say enough about the view. It was a gorgeous way to wake up and look out over the ocean. The room's floor to ceiling length mirror made it so much easier to get ready for my event at night and the bathroom was so spacious I probably could have had a party in there. I highly recommend making use of the large soaking tub in the bathroom. Perfect for relaxation and unwinding.

The hotel was going through renovations and construction, but I am not going to take away any ratings due to that and related noise. The pool was closed (bummer!) BUT the beach is nearby and my son and I loved going there everyday. The front desk always had clean beach towels available, and gave my son a little beach bucket with sand toys. The gym is small but kept clean and has the basic essentials (weight bench with weights, treadmills, elliptical, leg machines). Gym bonus: two patios with sliding glass doors which made it easy for me to keep an eye on my son as he played with his gadgets, while I was working out. The shuttles to various places in Honolulu (Ala Moana center, and downtown areas) made getting around easy! Many, grateful thanks to Michi, the shuttle driver, who made our trips enjoyable. He truly is a gem and I hope the hotel management recognizes him - he went out of his way one night to make sure my son and I got on the shuttle when the Ala Moana stop had been closed off to traffic. Everyone we encountered was incredibly nice, even the construction workers. The doormen were polite and easy to talk to, the housekeepers reminded me of old friends. One problem we had was the lack of a laundry room within the hotel, so we had to make trips to the local laundromat which cut into fun time. The view from our room was beautiful with the exception of the tons of trash in the boat harbor. I hope the hotel can coordinate with the owner of this boat harbor to have it cleaned often (maybe once a week they can hire needy workers to keep this clean? Just a thought). Many thanks for the fresh coffee in the mornings, and flavored water in the afternoon. We never took advantage of the restaurant in the hotel (we looked into Christmas dinner but it was already full). Tips for those travelling with kids: Magic Lagoon is nearby, less than 10 minute walk, and has a very low key beach which made us feel very safe. There is also a running/walking path, shaded in many parts, which my son loved running on. Also, if you do plan on walking to/from the downtown area, its about half an hour with a little one in tow. We saw a magic show and by the time it was over, the hotel shuttles were done for the day, so we walked back to the hotel. Again, many thanks for a great stay!","Fairfax, Virginia","294dilo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, Virginia</strong>",32,5.0

The wallpaper is fabulous and the mechanized window treatments were a great touch. A large flat screen tv topped it off. We had 2 queen sized beds and they were very comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows highlighted an amazing view of the marina and neighboring beaches. The bathroom was amazing and the toilet was so high tech. Heated seat! Built in Bidet! Nice that you can have multiple getting ready at once in the bathroom.Be sure to check out the 100 Sails restaurant. We were fortunate enough to do both the dinner buffet which included multiple types of crab and the breakfast buffet which was just as bountiful. Both were on the expensive side so be forewarned.The staff that we encountered were all pleasant, understanding and helpful. Our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer.
