The hotel was very accomdating with holding our luggage and providing us a place to shower and change even after we had checked out. The concierge was also very helpful in planning events.

We were high up and actually got a corner room with a view that can't be beat. We could watch the surfers at Waikiki and also see all the way around to the canal behind. I would say that the bathroom is tight and it is difficult to get past the toilet to get into the tub but there is a grab bar. Other than that, it is a good hotel with a large breakfast area and friendly front desk people. The pool area is nice but on the 5th floor so not really a view from there. There is putt putt and shuffle board that were used by families. We sat there to relax after a long day of sightseeing so we did not mind the late afternoon shade. The hotel is slightly further from the Waikiki beach but those hotels are higher price and beach was not part of our plans.","Grapevine, Texas","slix1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grapevine, Texas</strong>",32,4.0

Before we even planned going to Honolulu, I have searched for a reasonable hotel with good rating and breakfast included. And this was it. I joined us for their club member rate. It’s basically the same as local rates and senior rates. Except these one, we’ll earn points. We got to the hotel, went straight to the parking lot on 2nd floor. Bring the parking ticket and head to Lobby. They will validate the ticket so you can leave anytime just place the barcode into the machine and the next time you come back, they see your car plate number in the camera, they just open. Parking fee was expensive though, $35 plus tax a day. Our room was great. We stayed at the 33rd floor and the wind was howling all the time. If you’re don’t mind it, it’s fine. If not, request for lower floors. The view was great too. Breakfast was awesome. Plenty of tables. Good selection of items. Staffs were so nice. Everyone were very friendly and helpful. We love it.

Our experience here was the same. The staff were all very nice from check in to check out. We chose this hotel because of the cost, the breakfast that is included, the jacuzzi, outdoor games (large chess, large shuffle board, the small mini putt course & the gaming room. When we arrived, It was as the pictures showed. There was no fooseball & no ping pong table. The pool water was ice cold! I only saw a few brave children go in. One disappointment was that they charge a resort fee of $25 a day. Not something I’d expect to pay at an Inn. I was upset because they did not inform me of that when I booked. Rooms: pretty small, but enough space for the 3 of us to be comfortable. Beds & pillows were comfortable. Better than some high end places we’ve stayed at. The ac was a minor inconvenience. It is a little louder than most window units. I did not like the fact that it turned on & off every once in awhile. I understand the reasoning behind that. But when it turns back on, it loud & startled me a few times. The shower head is a bit low. So if you’re taller than 5’8”, this will be an issue. Location: a little ways out from the heart of Waikiki. Not ideal when walking back late at night. But if you’re a family like us, we enjoy walking so it wasn’t much of an issue. Breakfast: not sure why some people are grumbling about a breakfast that’s included in the hotel room cost. It was a good breakfast. Everyday there was sausage patties, biscuits & gravy, yogurts, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, bread, muffins, bagels, cereal, juice & coffee. The main dishes changed daily. Bacon, link sausage, egg whites, scrambled eggs, cheese omelette. Parking: stalls are limited. They have 146 stalls & 596 rooms. Cost is $35 a day. If you can’t get a stall, you park across the street. Not sure what they charge. ","Kaneohe, Hawaii","46kvrv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",5,4.0

But not real impressed with the hotel itself. Our room was very strange... we had to go to 1 floor above and then go down 2 flights of stairs that were pretty steep to get to room(there is no other way) Yes while carrying huge luggage-which also means every time you went in and out of room you were going up & down stairs!!!! Even though room was a ""suite"" it was so small and the bathroom was ridiculously small! You have to turn sideways to get in the bathroom door literally and almost stood in the toilet while exiting the shower. The laundry facility is very sketchy! I made my husband go with me every time I went there because it had straight access to the parking garage which anyone can sneak into. Someone could be laying in wait and attack a person as they are using the key card to enter the room. very dangerous and scary.","Alton, Illinois","Melinda P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alton, Illinois</strong>",1,2.0

And honestly the best thing about this hotel is Nore from Morocco at the tour desk. He made our trip a memorable one by our go to person if we had any questions and he was super informative. He’s an asset to this hotel and I believe he should be in a managerial position. Not one day went by where he didn’t check up on us or greet us with a smile, and based our observation he was that way with all of his guests. I’ll post a pic, so that future guest can look out for this awesome guy. Anyways let’s get into the real story. So we checked in very late because our flight arrived from Las Vegas about 10:30p. The check in process was smooth and Derek was polite. My sister and I requested two beds but apparently that was an extra fee so we decided to stick with the king bed. Our room was 1507..avoid this room at all costs. I’ve been to many hotels and this is the smaller room I’ve ever come across. It’s literally a cubicle. There’s no room for TWO people to walk and I bumped my feet on furniture SEVERAL times and when I got home I had several bruises on my legs. These rooms are only suitable for sleeping. There is no privacy at Atlanta. Otherwise you’re gonna feel like you’re in a cell. On our final night the fire alarm went off at 4am. When we evacuated our room we were told it was a “false alarm”. No apology. No compensation from the hotel. We couldn’t go back to sleep and my sister and I had anxiety and felt panicky all the way back to Las Vegas.

While they are indeed clean, this is by far the loudest hotel room I have ever stayed in. I am a professional pilot of 27 years and have stayed in countless hotel rooms. You can very clearly hear people’s conversations in not only adjacent rooms, but rooms across the hall, as well. People talking in the hallways sound as if they are actually in your room. That is, you can hear them when the cheap bargain basement window unit air conditioning isn’t running. These awful a/c units endlessly cycle on and off. They are so loud, you can’t hope to carry on a conversation or watch tv while they are running. They also positioned the units adjacent to the beds, so that when the unit is running, its right next to your head and blowing air directly in your face as you are trying to sleep. I was on the 35th floor and it sounded as if they were actually piping in the street noise from far below. Then there is the breakfast. On the surface, it looks okay, but when one starts eating the food, you find out that looks are deceiving. The eggs are downright awful. The sausages are terrible. The orange juice was so watered down that it was virtually tasteless. Stick with toast or cereal. The staff is courteous and helpful. The location is fair.

So I showed up early so I had to wait for my room to be ready (understandable) so... 3pm comes around and they tell me that the room is being cleaned and that it would be ready soon. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes later they tell me the room is ready ( I’m like what????) so I asked if the check out time would be increased by 30 minutes since they took 30 minutes to get it ready for me and their answer was “oh, I’m sorry... we can’t do anything about it, check out is at noon” so if I stay a minute later than noon they will charge me for another day. So... what I don’t understand is why wasn’t the room ready if it was booked weeks in advance? Why did they take 30 minutes of the time I paid for using the room and won’t give that time back or maybe a refund for those 30 minutes they took away for me????

Everything was very clean and modern. It's also cheaper than some of the other hotels. However, it has some of the smallest hotel rooms I have ever been in, even smaller than those in Hong Kong and Tokyo! It wasn't that much of a problem for me and my partner but anyone who is on the bigger side or have a lot of luggage might have some trouble moving around. Nonetheless, despite the small size of the room, it has all the amenities you would expect to find in a hotel room and it was very clean. The bed and pillow were also quite comfortable. Free breakfast was also included and the options were decent. What made my stay enjoyable was the level of service. All the staff, from the front desk to the housekeeping to those manning the breakfast were all super friendly and helpful. Some things I didn't like about the hotel - the $37 per day parking fee is utterly ridiculous. There is no reason why the parking has to be that expensive. Having a car makes the vacation much more convenient and enjoyable, and you're essentially held hostage by the hotel since you'll either be forced to pay to park there or give up on renting a car. Also, I find it odd that no complimentary water is provided. All the other Holiday Inns I've been in provides complimentary water and I don't understand why they can't provide it here. The AC is somewhat awkwardly placed since it blows directly at your head. It's also super loud and has this weird smell, but thankfully the window opens and there is a fan that you can use if you don't want to use the AC. Finally, I think there can be better quality control on the cleanliness of the towels. Most of them were clean and fine, but some still has stains when I held it up in front of a light to check.","Los Angeles, California","Ming M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,3.0

The service is good, but they are on the stingy side with toilet paper, kleenex, and they would not give me a glass to take to my room for my 12 yrs old single-malt scotch, they offered paper cup! Yuck! I had to go buy glasses, luckily there are many stores in less than a mile radius. The rooms are clean but small (think Japan) and in the morning, one must get up and go downstairs (no room service except Doordash) the coffee and meals available in their school style cafeteria, leaves something to be desired. The beach is within 8-10 min walking distance and if you are on a budget, buy your meals at the local 7-11, they are actually healthily prepared meals (next to the cashier) of local and filipino style foods for less than $8, only 7-10 min walk from the hotel.

My husband had a bit of buyers remorse as he usually stays at Hilton properties and there was one down the street for more points but there were no refunds. This property is nice for the price and the staff is fantastic! We disembarked our cruise ship at 9 and arrived at the hotel around 9:30. We thought we would have to store our suitcases (we had a lot!) but they were able to find us 2 rooms beside each other and one was ready, so we moved all our suitcases to that one. The attendant was already cleaning out the second one. Very few other hotels would make you wait until the allotted checkin time but they went above and beyond to get us 2 rooms together. Shoutout to the hotel employee Virginia! She was awesome. We left for the airport to pick up our car rental and by the time we got back our room was clean. The bathroom is small but to say it’s smaller than a cruise ship bathroom is not accurate. The shower is spacious unlike a cruise ship. It serves its purpose. There is no real closet space but they do have places you could lay your suitcase down off the floor and the enclave by the door stored our larger suitcase. The AC is loud but it works and serves its purpose of keeping your room clean. It’s an easy, albeit crowded journey, to the freeway but it’s close enough to be convenient and approximately 15 minutes to the airport if traffic isn’t ridiculous. The free breakfast is nice. It has a lot of different options and while it looks crowded it has 3 lines of the same food. Also, it has 4 different toasting stations so you’re not waiting for others. It does stay consistently busy for breakfast but their break crew is on the ball with cleaning tables and replenishing stock. As this is downtown Waikiki parking is a premium but we paid more for even more remote locations and they do warn you the lot could fill but they’ll refund you if you can’t find a spot for the night. We didn’t have an issue since we were touring each day and when we got back at night there was space available.

Us and another couple booked 2 suites which looked very spacious in the pictures. We arrived at the same and their room was ready...ours wasn’t. We were told the front desk would call us when our room was ready...that never happened! We were told at the front desk that both of our rooms were on the 25th floor. No problem, right? Well there was a major problem...the elevator doesn’t stop on the 25th floor. You have to stop on the 26th floor and walk down this odd stairway to get to our room. I do not do steps very well and for anyone else that used a wheelchair, walker or crutches it would be almost impossible. No where on the website does it mention that this is the case for the suites. We had to have bell service get our luggage to the room. Once inside the room was nice. Sitting area, extra chair, king bed and two window air conditioners. Now for the bathroom! It is by far the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in all of my years of traveling. Bathrooms in cruise ships are bigger! I am attaching a picture of both the stairwell and the bathroom so you can see. Morning breakfast is quite nice, the have three buffet lines as it does get quite crowded. There is a laundry on the third floor. Washers and dryers are both $4.00 per load. Word of advice..buy your detergent at the ABC store. It’s about half price! Would I stay here again...not sure.

I informed the front desk staff that I am a spire elite member and inquired about a room upgrade based on my hotel status. I was then told that assigning me a room with two beds is already an upgrade. I informed the staff that general rooms can come with one or two beds, which is assigned during check in. There was an awkward silence and I just decided to drop the issue. The staff did not appear to be knowledgeable. Hotel loyalty does not appear to be valued here. It was only at check out that I was thanked for my loyalty. The rooms were very small and the ceilings were very low. I am 5’8 and can easily injure myself if the I raised my hand while the fan is on. The AC was also SUPER LOUD. In the two bed room, one of the beds was located right under the AC.

So I’m going to do this review justice and give full details/photos including what rooms you should request for the best beach view. Breakfast: First off, the biggest plus I can give this hotel is the breakfast. It is a very large room with 3 different lines to help get everyone through quickly. It is a full continental breakfast including a delicious cinnamon role, and even 4 machines that make pancakes instantly in an assembly line format at the push of a button (I had never seen a machine like this before and the fact you can watch your pancakes cook was very cool). Another great thing about the breakfast was the fact that every morning about 10 or so of the hotel staff lined up at the entrance to the dining room all giving a warm “Aloha”. Breakfast is served from 6:30-9:30 am however most people get down there right at 6:30 (since everyone is wide awake being so many hours behind the mainland USA). There is a lot of indoor seating however it does fill up quickly, thankfully there is a huge shaded outdoor patio that stretches around the entire dining area with plenty of seating as well (just watch out about leaving your plate, the native birds out there are big time scavengers). Room: As far as room size goes, I’ll be the first to admit it is close quarters. There is a chair and a desk that can be moved around (it’s the kind that is L shaped and slidable) however not much room beyond that and the bed. The rooms all have ceiling fans (a plus to keep you extra cool) and inwindow AC. I know some people said it was loud for them, personally I like the sound of air blowing and if you have heard any window unit AC work before it’s basically that. Not that big of a deal.Resort: The 5th floor is where the “resort” part comes in. It’s an inside/outside area with inside being the fitness area, but outside being a huge deck that is the size of the parking garage below (as the rest of the building is tall and skinny for floors 6-40). There’s one pool, a large hot tub with plenty of seating area (looked like it could hold 10 people on each side as it was a large rectangle with bench seats on both sides), a 9 hole mini golf course plus a life size chess board. Had a lot of open seating and I felt there was room for all outside.Parking: There is 3 levels of parking (floors 2-4) for this hotel. Cost is $35 a night. Spaces are tight and the hotel does fill up at night (if you charge 5 nights of parking and can’t find a space one night the hotel will reimburse you for it). However, we normally left around 9 am and were back by 6 pm every night and found plenty of spaces every time. Elevators: Being a 40 story building, it is easy to see why some people could be concerned with elevator functionality. There are 6 elevators, 3 on each side with each bank serving different floors. The left side serves 2-24, right side serves 2,3,25-40+ (I think the top floor was 44 but not sure. Elevators came pretty quickly on both sides, only time it was a few minutes slow was breakfast time when everybody was either coming down or going up. But otherwise elevators were fast and efficient. The one thing to note: the 2nd floor is for housekeeping (you can go here to request more towels/soap/etc. and 3rd floor is guest laundry. Both the 2nd and 3rd floor elevators also service the garage and are available on both banks. However, the 4th floor garage elevator and even the 5th floor resort area must be accessed from the left bank (that goes up to floor 24). So if for example you are staying on the 30th floor and either wanted to go to your car on the 4th level or wanted to go to the pool on the 5th, you’d have to first ride the elevator to the lobby then take the left bank up to those 2 floors. Some people may find this to be a terrible inconvenience to take a couple extra minutes, if so you will want to request to not be on a floor higher than 24 (so you can be serviced by the left bank elevators that access 2-24).Beach access: The hotel is under a half mile to the beach, as Fort DeRussy beach park is directly in front of it, and you can walk through the park directly to the beach. There is a nice boardwalk there with food places and a beachfront bar.My Advice: So now you’re probably wondering; what room/floor should I be on for the best view? Well I happened to stay on the 22nd floor in room 2205 and my view of the ocean was great, totally unblocked and I could see Fort DeRussy Beach Park as well. However, the Hotel La Croix is directly in front of the Holiday Inn, and from my view on the 22nd I would say that if you want an unobstructed view of the ocean, you need to be at least on the 20th floor to see over the hotel in front. I am not sure what the back side views are as there are hotels to the left and right, I know from the resort area on the 5th you can see over the canal and into the mountains unobstructed so I would guess any backside rooms would have this view at least. But the ocean side rooms are all in the single digit room numbers, something to keep in mind when requesting a certain room.Hopefully this review helps those that are particular like me when looking for a hotel. I’ve included photos that show the room size, view (from 2205) and breakfast area.Thanks and have a great day!","Saint Louis, Missouri","T-Dawg93</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",13,5.0

We stayed in their kingsize bedroom which was small. Including the bathroom. Though they were able to maximize the space very well. It comes with a mini ref, microwave and coffeemaker. The room looks updated. The weird thing about this room is the window type air conditioning is pointed towards the left side of our headboard so we had to put a cover so it doesn’t hit our faces while we sleep. On our third night the air conditioning conked out. But it was immediately replaced within an hour. I must also say our housekeepers on the 43rd floor were very nice and efficient always friendly and accommodating to our needs. The room rate comes with buffet breakfast as with other H.I.E properties and with the same spreads. I only wish that they would have a little variety everyday like maybe sausage on monday and the next day its bacon and so forth. On our third day we just bought malasadas for breakfast since we got sick and tired of the same menu.  They have a huge dining area with indoor and outdoor sitting. The staff at the dining area a very efficient. They are used to the crowd and efficiently replenish the food, clean up tables and even shoo away the birds bothering guests eating outside. The parking is on first come first serve basis. There are more rooms than parking slots. You have to settle for street parking if you run out of slot. They also have a nice size swimming pool and jacuzzi on the 5f. With a number of pool chairs and cabanas. There is also a mini golf, ping pong table, chess game and game room good for families with kids.  Location is 10 minutes walk to waikiki beach. You can cut through the park with beautiful banyan trees. I prefer this than being right on the crowded Waikiki beach area. There is an ABC store across the street for your emergency needs.

Arriving at the hotel, they have a valet service, but they only stay for a short time throughout the day *if* they're even at the podium. They have a drop-off section in the front of the hotel, but there's nowhere to park and leave your car while you check-in without someone pulling up behind you and needing to leave.After checking in, we went to our room. I know most places in Hawaii don't use air conditioning, but they did have a window unit in the room. The problem is, it gets extremely hot in the room and if you leave the window unit running, it's extremely loud, so you can't hear the TV or anything as the rooms are quite small. The unit is also located right next to the bed which blows directly on you. We ended up having to put a towel over ours to get some decent sleep without it 1) drying us out and 2) being able to sleep in quiet.The worst part about this place is ultimately the parking garage. They told us in the beginning that the garage is first come, first serve. There aren't enough spots for each guest at the hotel. They stated that if parking wasn't available in the garage, they'd help us find a spot. One night, the garage was full, so we went to the front desk. She stated to go to one of the other parking garages, bring in your ticket, and they'll refund the parking fee for that night. We drive over to that garage and it's full. We go to the other one they suggested and it's full. How do you build a 43 story hotel and not have a place for each guest to bring a car? Most people will rent a car and end up trying to park on the street or they'll have to park so far away that they end up needing to get an Uber just to get to and from their car. Luckily we only had an issue with finding parking for one night, but it does get crowded fast, especially on the weekends when more people come into town.One of my biggest pet peeves with the parking situation is that their laundry room is on one of the parking garage floors. They ship off some of their laundry to be done because there's too much of it to be handled on-site. Not a problem, except the carts they keep their laundry in take up SIX PARKING SPACES, so no matter what time of day you come in or out, there are laundry carts taking up six parking spaces that people could have parked in. From the beginning, the garage didn't work properly. It's supposed to read a ticket that they've validated for your entire stay when you enter and when you leave. You use the same ticket each time. Sometimes the tickets would get eaten on leaving and you'd have to get a new one each time, prompting you to have to go to the lobby and re-validate it each time you used the garage. Other times, it wouldn't even give you a ticket. There were some times it kept saying the garage was being blocked and you'd have to call the front desk and ask them to open it for you every time you left. It wasn't just us either, we watched countless cars have the same problem ahead of us causing traffic down the street of people trying to get in and out of there easily.While most of these things seem minor in comparison to other problems, it's the convenience of things that makes your vacation relaxing and dealing with these was exhausting after a couple of days of it.Overall, it's not a bad place to stay if you're not driving anywhere on your own and staying directly in walking distance of places or taking Ubers/shuttles everywhere, but if you have a car, it wouldn't be my first choice, especially if you like sleeping in peace and quiet.","Clearwater, Florida","christinalupi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clearwater, Florida</strong>",37,2.0

Getting to our room was a trying experience, as there aren’t enough elevators to accommodate the guests. Once we got there, we found the room to be uncomfortably small. And, the noisy A/C is placed right beside the pillow on one side of the bed (so, it blows air in one’s face all night). On the positive side, the room was clean and the staff was pleasant.Being IHG Spire Elite members, we thought we’d give the hotel a second chance, as we earn points and perks with every IHG hotel stay. In order to have a bigger room, we booked their best: a “suite” (sort of ~ they use the term loosely). We scheduled our flight and hotel arrival for 3:00PM ~ their “official” check-in time. We waited in line ~ only to be told the room wouldn’t be ready for a half an hour more. Then it was another half hour. Then, another. Our suite was finally ready at 5:37PM. (Credit where it’s due: Sylvia waived our amenity fees for our trouble.) Next came the usual long wait at the elevator. OK, we knew that. Then, the suite...... It was located on the 25th floor. No elevator goes to the 25th floor. Seriously. So, one rides the elevator to the 26th floor, and then walks down a short flight of stairs ~ which would be fine if one wasn’t in HNL for medical reasons ~ which we were. The “suite” is one large room with one small cruise-ship-sized bathroom. The door to the bathroom was ridiculously narrow (see pic ~ yes, the door is all the way open). Again, noisy A/C ~ but, they do provide a white-noise effect to muffle the street noise below. And, for all this, our room wasn’t even reasonably priced ~ a bill well over $800 for three nights!

I've been traveling for a long time and I travel inside and outside of the USA. This Hotel and service by far has been the worst hotel experience I have ever experienced in the past 20 years. I cannot believe the non-sense that happened. I booked rooms with this hotel from the 3rd-8th. Unfortunately, when we got here to check in, they did not have a room for us on the 5th. So we figured we could find a room for that 1 day some where else and return to our reserved rooms. The person helping us “Brea” mis-heard my wife and I discussing this and decided to cancel my July 4th reservation. Which by the way was my 3-year wedding anniversary. So on the 4th morning we go travel the island on a tour and return by 5pm to get to our room. The door key would not work, so I went down to get new keys. This is when this got ridiculous and I could not understand the logic they where trying to feed me. They said I was locked out and needed to pay for the day. I initially purchased the rooms for $114.00 a night. Good deal right??? Wrong.... the wanted me to pay $387.00 in order to get my bags. I said, this is not my fault that you cancelled my reservation, note that I have the 5th, 6th and 7th booked. They wanted me to pay the $387.00 or pay at least 1/2 of this amount just to release me bags. I was so upset, I asked to speak to the manager or supervisor and this is where it got even worse. I own a construction business and a restaurant and both businesses are successful and have a 4-1/2-5 rating. This supervisor ""Silvia"" was the most rudest, non-sensible, heartless person I have ever spoken to in my entire life. The reasons for the 3- star rating on this hotel comes from the management supervision of this person alone. She was so rude, she would not listen to what I was saying and would not take the mistake that her employees made into any consideration and just treated me like a homeless person. She continued to talk down to me and not even listen to what I had to say. It takes me a lot to get upset and still with all the low blows and nonsense that she was giving me for her peoples mistakes, I still kept my self relaxed as I felt like screaming on top of my lungs. Again, our anniversary was on this day and I would have hoped for her to do the right thing and let me stay in the room I booked for $114.00 instead of charging me 1/2 of the room and ask me to leave and return the following day. This gets worse, I had to go book 2- nights not one because her employee cancelled the 4th - 6th. I had to find another hotel during the holiday just so that my wife and I don't sleep on the streets. During my whole stay in Hawaii, I had 3- credit cards not working due to the deposit holds from all three hotels that I booked only because this women Silvia who calls her self a supervisor, not caring or having any type of sympathy for us. I was not asking for anything free or for anything ridiculous. I just wanted her to know and acknowledge that her team made a mistake and we should have been able to stay for the rate that we originally purchased the rooms for. I really hope she is removed from her position as I wouldn't want her near my businesses. I hope some one reaches out to me and makes this up as well. As I will be writing this same review on all websites to assure you that this should not ever happen to any human being. I was treated like an animal. Felt like I didn't even exist during our conversation. I want full refund or free rooms and I feel I deserve it as my anniversary was ruined due to this hotel and this supervisor Silvia.",,DanElbard,5,1.0

Location is steps away from the beach, shopping, and restaurants. Pool is small but adequate. Putt putt and other outdoor games are available on the pool deck.

The view really is wonderful. The location is great if you don't mind a 20 minute walk to Waikiki beach (and we didn't mind at all).There is a terrific place for coffee just over the road.The bed was super comfy. Slept very well each night we were there.The breakfast is more than adequate - cereals, bakery items, hot items, fruit, yougurts etc. All the stuff you expect. The coffee was ghastly - hence my reference to the coffee place over the road.There is a capsule type coffee maker in the room.There is a small ""market"" near reception where you can purchase odds and ends - drinks, toiletries etc.USB connections at each bedside was a big plus.The hotel is clean.Now to the bad points:This building seemed tired. The elevators are slow and there are only 3 for levels L-24 and another 3 for levels 25-42. There is no service elevator, so often housekeeping staff are competing with guests to fit in these small elevators (12 people maximum).The elevators and common areas on each floor are NOT airconditioned. The air conditioner in the room was so loud we had to turn it off and rely on the ceiling fan, which did work well.There is very little hanging space, although there are adequate drawers for clothes.Although there is a coffee maker, they gave us 1 coffee, 1 decaf and 2 tea capsules. We did try to buy additional capsules without success.Hence the reference to the coffee shop across the road (much nicer coffee)They claim to be mindful of the environment, but each day you get 2 plastic cups in the bathroom each covered in plastic. The coffee cups are disposable cups too. What's wrong with proper cups and glasses?There is no facility to sort your trash into rubbish and recyclables.When we checked in (and we stayed here on 2 separate occasions), reception took ages to find our booking. They even sent us to sit down while they took 15 minutes tracking it down. This happened TWICE! I can't complain about the people on reception because they did they best they could, but TWICE!?As others have said, the rooms are SMALL. They wouldn't seem so tiny if they had a balcony. Sadly they do not. That's my mistake for not finding a hotel with balcony.The lady that takes your ticket at breakfast needs to be more cheerful. Seriously - she is not a good start to the day. Each morning I said ""Good Morning"" to her and she just sort of grunts at you. The other breakfast staff are pleasant though.The windows in the room are not double glazed, so you get a lot of street noise - particularly the sirens up kalakua Avenue.And now the annoying:The fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate. Got down 17 floors before it was called off (false alarm). Then it took ages to get back to our room because of the 3 small elevators. Waiting in an airless floor lobby for 30 minutes was no fun at all.

Due to being a Platinum member for business traveling I was able to get a good deal on two rooms for almost two weeks.I didn’t expect a lot as there is a reason IHG is affordable but we were pleasantly surprised. Part of the hotel was closed off for construction but it didn’t cause us any problems.

After getting there I have to wonder if it's legal or safe for a hotel room to be this small? It's definitely not comfortable or relaxing. They have crammed as many rooms as they can possibly get into the building with no regard for their customers comfort. Felt like we were packed into a can of sardines. They chose to sacrifice quality for quantity. This was a very bad decision and will definitely cost them customers in the future. The loud window air conditioner was mere inches from the bed and blows onto your face. It wasn't controlled with the thermostat. A maintenance man finally came to the room hours after we complained but said he was unable to fix it. (I wonder now if the HVAC is set up like this due to so many people being in such a small space). You get too cold and wake up to turn it off, then you get to hot and wake up to turn it back on. I ended up getting sick because of this. Other reviews talk about a nice view but our widows were so dirty on the outside that the view was obscured. The ceiling fan is way too large for the room and hangs dangerously close to your head, someone is going to get hurt. I wonder if their insurance is aware of this? The water pressure is terrible in the shower and gets worse when the person on the other side of the cardboard wall is taking a shower or flushes the commode. The doors aren't slow closing doors and are VERY loud and rattle the walls when they slam close. The walls are very thin with zero noise barrier. People snoring in different rooms kept us awake. BUT to hear people using the restroom was just plain gross. It was like we were literally in the restroom with them. I will never forget this. Parking is EXPENSIVE and you get charged EVERY TIME you move your car and re-enter the parking garage. If the garage fills up you can park several blocks away and walk to the hotel but this feels unsafe as there were some suspicious people hanging around the area and in front of the hotel by the parking garage entrance.

The mini golf area was a big hit for my two young boys. The rooms were fine and location was only a short walk into the main centre of town and a short walk to the beach. The check in staff were great and most front line staff were friendly to deal with during my staff.The table tennis area needs to be relocated to an area which is more sheltered with the winds that are common at this level from the ocean area it makes playing with a light ball difficult. I was able to quickly identify various more ideal locations but I will leave you to see if you can see them too.We returned for a second stay after coming back from the north shore. The check in lady was a manager or supervisor and manner due to wearing a different attire our experience with her and her attitude at check in was unfortunately not great. She was more interested in telling me about the Hawaii laws and regulations rather than providing a friend check in process. Some training is probably required with this member of staff as they approach this work with an iron fist rather than aloha spirit and I don't really need to hear about their policy and procedures at check in.If the property requires a specific set of requirements around check in with the booking then these should be detailed as part of the reservation. My wife presented all passport holders of guests at check in, credit card and disappointedly was dismissed that this was not sufficient and only I could check in. My wife was left unable to check in with two young children left waiting until I could arrive which was less than ideal.I am not against law requirements and happy to meet any of these obligations, if they are however required the hotel needs to clearly outline these in the confirmation email.I note that the confirmation email did not provide this requirement that I needed to be in attendance nor did the reservation information request this information despite prior knowledge that 2 adults and 2 children would be present.Frustratingly despite initially providing all the passport holders, I was asked again to write down the names of all the guests again by the check in member of staff.The property really needs to proceed towards a frictionless checkin process it seems the procedures have not captured the enhancements in technology to remove a number of these obstacles and probably requiring some review with technology advancements now available. The conduct of the manager or supervisor that performed the check in was only interested in reciting the Hawaii law rather than handling the situation with grace. After a long days travel this was not what we expected especially from management.As a member of IHG too this was less than an ideal experience.No doubt a short 30 minutes brain storming session on how to approach this next time could address such short comings in the future.",,Alex J,13,4.0

The pool is just embarrassingly tiny (the pictures can be deceiving).The parking is way too expensive for guests. $35 a day when I’m already paying over $1000 for the week?!?

Right across from the hotel are a few convenient stores to buy water, pop, alcohol, sunscreen, fruit, snacks, souvenirs etc. As a large group we used a tour bus a few times-other wise we walked to all locations. Like the beach, hard rock cafe, international street food market, italian buffet, and flea market. Its about a $45 taxi ride and 25 minutes to the hotel from airport. The continental breakfast includes-cereal, oatmeal, fruit, eggs, bacon, yogurt, milk, juice, coffee, pancakes, toast, bagels. It was sufficient for the week. The rooms are little. They have what you need but tiny. Hairdryer, coffee maker, and extra towels at pool. The pool is not heated and closes early-8 pm. The pool is also small but the beach is near so we did not use much. Service was great. Very cheerful staff and helpful. Security monitored our kids halls. It is a little noisy. We were on 18th floor. With air conditioner on it was ok.

This must be the smallest room I ever have stayed in lately in a major hotel. Granted, the Holiday Inn Express brand is at the lower end of the IHG chain, but here the architects went too far.The room is dominated by the very comfortable queen-size bed with not quite 3 ft space on each side for the night tables and 4 ft at the foot end, where they still squeezed in a small drawer cabinet, which also serves as luggage rack and above a good-sized wall-mounted flat screen TV. A reading chair with an overhead lamp fills the corner. There is no writing desk, only a small movable and height-adjustable over-bed table meets that requirement.The window fills the entire width of the outer wall with the air conditioning unit stuck into one pane of it. Unfortunately, it is the side and height where your head rests on the bed. Extremely uncomfortable, if not impossible to sleep or even to lie on the bed with the unit turned on and the cold air blowing at you.The entrance hall is the width of the door plus a very narrow open closet, housing a fridge, coffee maker and microwave, but leaving just Inches for hanging your cloths. Even for Hawaii, where one doesn’t have to dress heavily, this is skimpy considering that most guest don’t just travel with an overnighter.The bathroom is sufficiently functional with a bathtub-size walk-in shower. A little more water pressure would be desirable.The hotel is extremely clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful like almost everybody in Hawaii. The free breakfast is simple but satisfies a normal hunger. To sum it up, the HI Express is not a bad deal, considering price and location if one travels light, stays are short and most time of the day is spent somewhere else.

I asked about an upgrade, and before I could even get it out of my mouth, he said there weren’t any. I also never hear a word from the management team; usually, you at least get a welcome letter or call, but I guess I shouldn’t expect so much from a Holiday Inn Express.The rooms are tiny, in fact, the table they have in the room looks like one of the hospital room bed adjustable tables. The room modern and was clean, but housekeeping lacked consistency. I asked for extra coffee daily and had to keep asking. They didn’t leave enough bathroom products; we ran out of soap, one day left two towels and one day three. They also charge you a $25.00 amenity fee per night, which is absurd. I am not sure what the amenities are unless you include the plunge pool and small gym “amenities.” The elevators are old and very slow, so expect it to take a while if you are on a high floor.It came with breakfast, which was borderline edible. I tasted the sausages and had to spit it out.

The rate was much cheaper as compared to the other brand name hotels on the island.

The staff member checking me in recognized me IHG Platinum status and upgraded me to an oceanview room, which was very much appreciated. The hotel is huge, and I was given a room on a high floor, with indeed good views of the ocean in the distance. While there is no bar or restaurant in the hotel in the evening, there is a mini-market in the hotel, where one can purchase drinks and snacks.The room was SMALL...like, European/Asian sized-room small. If I was here for more than one night, the small size of the room would have been a major issue, but it sufficed for one night, There is a complimentary breakfast offered in the morning, which was the standard Holiday Inn Express affair...adequate. There is a pool on-site, which was never very busy, as well as a hot tub with powerful jets. There is a mini-golf course in the hotel as well on the same floor as the pool, which I thought was a great amenity. There is also a game room for kids on the same floor, as well as a gym.Check-out in the morning was again very friendly. Overall, this hotel fit the needs for me for the night.

The breakfast was delicious but be prepared because it tends to be busy. The good thing is that there’s plenty of places to sit and eat, inside and outside. Now on to the rest of the hotel. There are two sets of elevators (which is fine) and you choose based on your floor number. That’s not such a big issue. However the elevators for the upper floors (floors 26-44), goes to the lobby, floors 2 & 3. If you choose to use the amenities you’ll be paying for ($26/day), which includes the pool, hot tub, games, chairs, fitness center, etc, you’ll need access to the 5th floor. Since we were on the 41st floor, we had to take one set of elevators down to either the lobby, the 2nd or 3rd floor, get off that set of elevators and get on the other set so we could go to the 5th floor. I’m not sure why both sets of elevators don’t have access to the 5th floor, but they don’t. As for the pool, hot tub, etc, the sun hits this area for a short time in the morning (the other high rises block part of the sun, that is, until it moves to the other side of the building). The hot tub is great, small but great. And unfortunately it’s used as a pool because the pool is freezing. When kids complain about how cold it it, it’s cold. As for our room, it was tiny. We had to ask them to remove the only chair because there wasn’t enough room for us to move around. The shower stall was the biggest part of the bathroom. We had a king size bed and while it was comfortable, it took up most of the room. We had to move things around to get in the mini fridge and around the room. The only part of the room of any size was the tv (and who goes to Honolulu to watch tv?). Now, on to parking. There is a charge for parking. Good luck trying to get a spot in the garage though (yes, they’ll remove the fee if you don’t get to park in their garage). It’s supposed to be for hotel customers only but since you don’t gain access to it with your room key card, I’m not sure how they know who’s parking in it. We found ourselves having to park a block away and walking back because their garage was full. If your hotel has almost 600 rooms, you should have more that maybe 136 (give or take) parking spots for your customers. We walked when the places we were headed to were close enough. And I think there’s public transportation close by, but since we didn’t use it, I won’t comment on it. This being said, the staff is friendly.","Lewisburg, Tennessee","bitsmom_tn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lewisburg, Tennessee</strong>",56,3.0

The hotel was clean, the staff was pleasant, and the location is nice for vacationers - it's a short walk to the beach, shopping, food, parks, and museums. There is a good spot to run along the pathway bordering the canal along Ala Wai Blvd, and on the weekend I had a nice longer run along Diamond Head Road. It's just a short walk to the beach to the west of the hotel. They have a very nice self-serve breakfast. The mattress was firm and comfortable, which I appreciated since I really dislike old, unsupportive mattresses. I never had any problems with parking (though it is pricey). I stayed on the sixth floor and parked on the fourth floor, so I never used the elevators other than on arrival and departure to move my luggage.

Reasonably priced, newly refurbished, clean establishment with breakfast included in the room rate. Most breakfasts offered by hotels in the US is not considered as a meal by me but this is a nice exception. Especially liked the ""pancake machine"" which spits out two freshly made pancakes in no time. If you don't wish to be frozen by the heavy AC of the breakfast room also can sit out where pigeons are a bit sneaky. Our room on the 42nd floor was small but functional with a stunning view on the city below and the hills around. The fridge is a nice touch instead of the useless minibar, so that you could have your own drinks cooled. Bed was comfy and the tiny bathroom had a usable size shower cabin with a proper glass door - not a bathtub with a disgusting curtain, thanks Holiday Inn! We only stayed in the room for the nights and early mornings when a fresh breeze came throgh the window, which combined with the ceiling fan was far better than the loud and freezing AC. The only annoying thing was the occasional noise of the slamming doors and flushing toilets of the adjacent rooms. The location is good, five mins walk from the ocean and in the close vicinity of dozens of stores and restaurants. Also there's a Dollar car rental two blocks away, where we rented a Mustang convertible for one day and drove up and down on the island. It was a great fun!

We booked a room with 2 queen beds and requested a higher floor. At check in, we were pleasantly surprised to be given a room with a partial ocean view and a view of Diamond Head which was really nice. Great beginning to the stay! The room itself is just what other reviewers had written, small, but in my opinion, it was good enough for what it was. After all, its Hawaii, how often are you in your room? The hotel had also been recently refurbished. For anyone that's been to Hawaii before, this used to be the old Maile Skye Court hotel.Hotel had the standard amenities..There's a pool which was located on the 5th floor. Very small and we had to take 2 elevators to get to the pool since our room was on one of the top floors. Other than that hiccup, towels were plentiful and there were also some outdoor games that the kids could play like a putting green, chess, ping pong, etc... There's also a hot tub on the same level but just like the pool, its also very small.One of the big pluses for this hotel was the fact that they served breakfast daily and that breakfast was already included into your rate. The standard of Holiday Inn Express. At check in, the front desk agent will give you vouchers for the duration of your entire stay. Upon entering breakfast, you will surrender 1 voucher per person attending. None were needed for the kids. The breakfast always consisted of some type of egg (scrambled or omelette form), breakfast meats, pancakes you can make on your own and various other choices. My kids loved the pineapple and mango yogurts that they had to offer. Nice Hawaiian touch added to the breakfast. Get there early as the seats fill up quick. But the staff was always helpful and replenished things promptly. If you sit outside, beware of the pigeons. They will lurk until someone drops a morsel... lol We also liked the location of this hotel because it was within walking distance to the old international market place and nearby restaurants and shopping centers of Waikiki. You can easily get a cab or the trolley pickup is right across the street at the La Croix hotel.So why the 3 star review... Although we enjoyed our stay here, the one big annoyance during the trip was the obnoxious concierge!!! Beware when booking any type of activity here... Although they may be somewhat knowledgeable about the tours and attractions, they have their own agenda which is to push Wyndham time shares. They will offer you a 200.00 credit in exchange for your time of seeing a timeshare presentation that they said was less than an hour. I almost laughed. What time share presentation has anyone been to that's been less than an hour? And it wasn't just one individual too. It was almost all of them. Any time you stopped and inquired, they're breathing down your neck about supposedly saving money by seeing the presentation. I'm sure that while some people may find this offer attractive, I did not. I'm in Hawaii to enjoy my time, not waste my time on some time share presentation.That being said, will we return to the Holiday Inn Express in Waikiki? Perhaps. Good amenities, short walks to nearby restaurants and shops...but will DEFINITELY stay away from that concierge desk..","Las Vegas, Nevada","VictoriaAllen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",174,3.0

The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. My biggest issue was the cleanliness of my room. As a travel agent, I travel extensively. I was very disappointed. The first night I noticed that my comforter was dirty. When I woke up that morning I realized that the pillow case I slept on had something on it which resembled ..black dye. I spoke with the rep at the desk and was told that a request would be submitted for the bedding to be changed. When I returned to the room that afternoon I realized the bedding was still dirty. The pillow case had been changed but the comforter was still the same. However, the bed was made up. The next day the room was not cleaned at all. This in addition to the air-conditioner unit being only about 16 inches across from the head of the bed made me very uncomfortable. I suffer from asthma so this is a health hazard for me (both dust & air blew directly in my face for several nights). Today I not only have bronchitis but a rash on the right side of my face which the dermatologist claims is from some type of germ. I’m pretty sure it’s from the bedding.

The location was fabulous - we walked everywhere and the Waikiki trolley stop was only a couple blocks over. That was our main means of transportation so it was extremely convenient. Staff was very pleasant and helpful - no problems there. Now to the room - VERY small. If you're here for awhile, you may want to upgrade to a suite. There's not much room if you've got your biggest luggage and there are only a few places where there's drawer space. The bathroom is also very small. Space is limited to put two people's toiletry bags and spread out. Definitely impossible to get two people in there to share the mirror. This room reminded me of a Manhattan hotel - they cram everything into a small space. The bed was very comfortable. No issues there at all. Now to the biggest complaint...the air conditioner. Obviously, Honolulu in September is a tad warm. While the thermostat operation is on the wall, the a/c unit is right next to the bed. When the unit is on, it's blowing right at you on the bed. It's noisy. If you're trying to watch tv, you have to crank it up. Thank goodness there was a ceiling fan in the room, because we had to turn the air off at night because of the noise. By the time we got up in the morning, it was 80 degrees in the room but the fact that it was blowing right on us (even after adjusting the vent) and the noise, it was just too much. I can't say a suite had a different a/c set up, but this room, being as small as it was, it was literally right next to the bed. Breakfast is absolutely wonderful. Lots of choices, and a huge breakfast area with plenty of places to sit - even outside. Clean and replenished often. Coffee cups are pretty small - I did see a lot of guests bringing 'to go' cups down from their room. The pool area was very nice - there are cabanas and ample lounge chairs around. Lots of things to do too - the 9 hole putt putt golf was fun. A bit of a challenge when the trade winds are kicking up, but a nice amenity. There's a ping pong table as well as shuffleboard too. The hot tub, however, wasn't hot at all. All in all, the hotel itself was very nice and convenient, but I had to take 2 points off for the a/c issue.","Myrtle Beach, South Carolina","turbotravelers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</strong>",55,3.0

I had anticipated a small room, but this was more akin to a Japanese hotel - which I suspect it was in a previous life. To give some context, it was that small that I could not lie down on the floor to do my morning sit ups... I am 6 ft.However, my biggest complaint was the aircon unit - which not only was one of those units that are mounted in the window, but the noise that it generated was so loud that I had to turn it off at night to sleep or to hear the TV. My friend has a similar experience in their room.Apart from that the rest of the facilities are in line with what you would expect from a HIX hotel...Given the size of the rooms I would only really recommend it for 1-2 people and only for those people who just need somewhere to sleep, wash and store there stuff - it is Hawaii after all!

Maybe have it out by the coffee somewhere. All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. The maid we had was wonderful. Gladys Rivera at the front desk is very knowledgeable and helpful. If she is not a manager, she needs to be one. She gets stuff done. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. Only a few blocks from the beach. Very easy walk.",,51barbaran,14,4.0

Both of these things were true, so we weren’t in shock when we entered the miniature guest room. It reminded me a lot of a hotel room we had stayed at in New York City near Macy’s. You can touch both sides of the hallway by your room with your outstretched arms. While sitting on the bed facing the air-conditioner, you can touch the unit. It’s just a couple of steps from the bed to anywhere in the room. The wall-mounted TV looks huge in the room. The room was fine for just the two of us. What we did was turn the A/C down to its lowest setting a couple of hours before we went to bed to make the room cold. Once we were ready to turn off the light and go to sleep, we just turned off the A/C altogether and we were comfortable all night long. When we woke up in the morning, it was only 76 degrees in the room, which is what we sleep at at home during the summertime. The room is tiny, but is is a small version of what you usually get in chain hotel guest room: closet, drawers, chair, coffee maker, refrigerator, and microwave oven. The bathroom was tiny, too, and I had to make a one-person rule when it came to being in there. The shower was nice as a completely glass-enclosed area. They had Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion. The lighting is easy on the eyes in both the bathroom and guest bedroom. We had a view from the 40th floor ocean side, which we loved and were glad we paid extra for the magnificent view of the ocean and surrounding areas.As for the public areas: The breakfast area seemed to have adequate indoor and outdoor seating. The food was standard chain hotel food. The pool and hot tub were rather small. There were cabanas for your use if you could get them at the right time. After reading some of the reviews, I will have to agree that it’s not a good idea to have a family in one of these rooms. It would be too crowded. As far as the parking garage goes, we didn’t have a car. With all of the cheap transportation in the area that can take you anywhere on the island, I don’t see any need to have one, so skip the car rental and use the available transportation instead. You can be paying more for parking + rental car costs in many cases than you would when hiring transportation. Also, you can walk anywhere from this hotel: the beach in ten minutes or less, many restaurants, stores, International Marketplace, etc. Many buses are available by the hotel. The location is good at the Holiday Inn Express. I will give this hotel 3 stars because of the room size. Also, I don’t understand why this hotel, which really isn’t a resort, charges a resort fee (even though they don’t call it that, it’s what it is). If you booked this place and are worried about it, it’s really not all that horrible. Just be prepared for a tiny room.

I normally stay at Hilton properties. Embassy suites hotels are usually the best no matter where you go. You will find a bad one occasionally. I love Marriott properties but have trouble finding them where I travel. Approximately 2 years ago all of my Hilton stays started being subpar all but Embassy suites. I changed over to the IHG group. Which includes Holiday Inn Express. I have been staying there ever since and quite honestly very impressed with them. I am now staying at the holiday inn express at this location. Unfortunately I have to give a negative response. I would not recommend this hotel at all. It is poorly designed. There is not a service elevator so you spend a lot of time waiting on the elevator because house keeping keeps them tied up. I definitely would not stay on the 25th floor. They explained to me that this floor was special as you would not have to be near the elevator doors opening and closing. Lol, they were correct I can't hear the doors at all due to the fact that the elevator mechanism that makes the elevator go up and down is right next to my inner wall. I was up all night. If I had not been so tired when I got to the room they would have changed it for me I promise.

Unfortunately, the property we used to stay at is no longer under IHG so this Holiday Inn location was available for our stay. Our stay was ""worth"" 35,000 points so I was definitely expecting to receive our points worth.Let me start off with the positives:1. Staff is OUTSTANDING! From the moment we pulled up confused about where ""parking/valet or no valet"" was a gentleman named Kenneth walked up to our car and assisted us! He helped us unload our bags, explained parking and the check-in process to us. He also let us know our bags would be delivered to our room after we checked in! 2. Check-in for Elite members has it's own line, it was super easy and quick! I witnessed the front desk staff dealing with some difficult customers in front of me, and again staff was extremely patient and professional.3. The hotel itself is very nice, great decor and relaxing! Good location to walk to stuff as well!4. Hello AC AND FANS in the room! I loved that and the beds were super comfortable. Negatives:1. THE ROOM...oh my god I thought we were in the wrong place. We are literally on top of the room next to us and a utility closet. When we walked in the room, I had to laugh. We had 3 suitcases and 3 carry-ons..not to include our personal bags. How we fit into the room is beyond me. It is so tiny the beds almost touch.. I could use the toilet and wash my feet in the tub at the same time.2. Parking was $33. We had just stayed at a Wyndham resort near the marina. Valet parking was $28. And they cannot assure you parking later in the evening if you move your vehicle. But if you find parking elsewhere they will refund the $33. Can I have that back to pay for my uber cost please. 3. Breakfast was just ok. Standard Holiday Inn food but I would have enjoyed seeing something from Hawaii on the menu. I did appreciate the Guava yogurt and Passion Orange juice.Staff and mild comfort would bring me back to this hotel. The place was spotless. We had originally booked 2 nights but went down to one instead. I'm grateful for that because we need rest and some room to back our staff before we head home. Unfortunately because the rooms are on top of each other and we were near the utility closet, the loud slamming of doors woke us up at 6am and now we are just exhausted. It is worth a nights stay if it's only just a couple or someone who just needs a quick spot to lay down at (in Waikiki you should be out and about anyways). Thank you to the staff at the Holiday Inn.

This hotel was the first in our DTS selection so chose it. Front reception was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the parking is $30 a night and this hotel only has about 100 slots for 600 guests. They will take the parking charge out of your bill for the day if you can’t find a slot. Bad part is you’ll have to find parking elsewhere, either at the paid public parking a street down which is about $25 a night, Ft. Derussy (sp?) or at the Hale Koa both are something like two blocks away. Room is very nice but SMALL!!! At $177 a night, thought we would get something wth at least a kitchenette. We have no choice now but to eat out everyday. Size is comparable to some folks walk in closet. Lol! They have a microwave, Keurig, and a small refrigerator. Tiny closet to hang clothes. Going to be hard to maintain our weight like this but they do have a gym on the 5th floor (haven’t checked it out yet). I’d recommend for short trips, not extended ones like ours will be. Good for singles or couples, not family with kids. Overall good except for the size of the rooms.Pics is of me standing at the front door taking a pic of the room and the closet w/microwave and refrigerator.

There are some good points about this hotel, but mostly it's a let down. Pros - Good location, only a few blocks to Fort De Russy Beach (one of the better beaches in Waikiki), decent/ample breakfast include in the price, friendly front desk staff, lots for kids to do on the 5th floor. Cons - small pool, long waits on the elevators, smallest ""closet"" ever, super tiny rooms, horrible air conditioning system, and clean the fish pond for goodness sake. I don't think we'll be back, even if the price is right... I had the Hilton Waikiki Village booked for about $650 more for four nights, but I thought I'd save a few dollars - I wish I'd spent the money or went for any of the Hilton or Marriott brands around Waikiki.","Denver, Colorado","ripcordzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",78,2.0

Third rate hotel near Waikiki, at best compared to a Motel 6 in an inner city.

The rooms are at best the size of the walk-in closet at my house. The bathroom is fit for a small child.2. The banking of elevators is awful. Want to wait in a line to get to your room, feel free to stay here.3. Parking may or may not be available. If it's not, go to a lot nearby. Great way to run a hotel.4. Asked the front desk about the issues with the AC unit. It says room temp is 77, is set to 68 but the AC won't turn on to lower temp much. If and when it does turn on, maybe it will lower temp to 75. Let the front desk know about this, but nothing was done. Contacted front desk again and they say they'll look into it. I don't someone to look into it late at night. It should have been corrected in the morning when the original request was made.This hotel should be removed at a hotel from the Holiday Inn chain. Don't stay here if you want comfort or to relax.

I am a IHG platinum member and was surprised there was no dedicated check in available. We booked the 2 queen full ocean view room and was allocated it on the 32nd Floor. The top floor is 44. We got to the room and it was tiny, with just enough room to walk around. It also had this blue table thing over the bed..a bit like a hospital. The bath room was tiny with barely enough room to move. Beside from being small the room itself was new, modern and had good amenities. The coffee pod machine and microwave were a great touch. The biggest issue we had was the noise of the air conditioning unit. It was old and sounded like a jet plane engine during the night as it kicked in and out. We complained and they by passed the wifi console on the wall and that kept the noise constant. We tried opening the windows but the humidity made that hard to maintain without the sea breeze.On level 5 the pool and activity areas was great. My kids loved the putt putt and ping pong. The gym was also decent. The only annoying thing was that we had to catch the lift to level 3 or lobby to get to the 5th floor from our room due to the lift configuration.The included breakfast was great and it was unbelievable how efficient the staff were keeping all the food stocked and tables clean.Housekeeping was a bit of hit and miss.Overall I think it is a good hotel and if the there was one bed in a room would be great, as I think the rooms are all the same size.

You don’t have to take the bus or take uber. The beach is about less than 10 minutes walk. Food: you will enjoy the free breakfast from 6:30-9:30am I enjoyed it so much. The breakfast area is wide and big with TVs and Newspapers. You don’t have to worry about sharing a table with another guest. Front Desk: Jeremy, Angela, Gladys and Beatriz will make your stay wonderful. They are very friendly and accommodating. Please be nice to them. Tip: If you are nice to them, you will enjoy your stay. Room: I had a King Size Bed however, my problem was the table. There was a “breakfast in bed table” but there was no normal table for me to eat in the room so I had to eat on top of the dresser because that’s equivalent to the height of the chair otherwise I have to go down and eat in breakfast area. Eating using the table next to the bed is probably romantic but not practical since no one is going to eat in bed all day. I was always eating out but when I had to eat my to go food I realized the area of focus in the room. Room Temperature: the temperature controller is not friendly especially on your first day trying to figure out how it works since it has unique coding. Not difficult to figure out but it is not just the normal controller of temperature and you will be freezing when you realize you have to study how it really works. House Keeping: The employees in House Keeping have the best smiles. They feel so greatful and happy, however I feel like the hotel needs to hire more to make their job easier.

The room was quite small but very compact and enough storage for us all. It was very clean. Maid service was excellent. Yes the air conditioner was loud but you could adjust it (not the sound obviously, but the temperature) and honestly, we definitely got used to the noise. And it's not like it came on ALL night long, it was intermittent so no, it wasn't an issue for us. The breakfast was fantastic!! I have to say, probably the best 'free breakfast' I've ever had at any hotel!!! The dining area is huge, with a huge covered patio outside and it's BUSY. If you are not in a rush, go down about 8:45/9am, this seemed to be a good time to get a table (once our party of 4 had to split up between 2 tables of 2 on our first morning). And no, they don't run out of food ;-) Get a cinnamon bun - trust me they are SO GOOD!!!The location was good, a bit far from the beach but still very walkable. We walked to International Marketplace, all over the shops of Waikiki, the beach etc. Otherwise we took Lyft/Uber to the aquarium (don't waste your time ,that place is tiny) Ala Moana and out to dinner a couple of nights. The pool and such are on floor 5 and while it's not a huge pool, it's a nice area. Plenty of deck chairs to get some sun.

The location is off centre from the main strip. It’s about a 10 minute walk from the Westin Moana Surfrider which is the centre of the Waikiki shopping strip. I appreciated the receptionist letting me check in at 11.30am since official checkin is normally that awful 3 or 4pm you get in the States. She may have looked on me favourably due to my IHG Gold Elite status.Room was small but adequate. Bathroom newly renovated. As mentioned by others the aircon is very loud (think jet engine) but didn’t stop us sleeping. Would be good if they replaced those with a quieter unit. Ok for a one night stay but would pony up for a better location if I were actually basing my holiday in Waikiki I did notice that there is a trolley bus (link circle type bus for $2) stop just nearby at Lewers St which is handy for ala Moana mall etc. Reccomend the popular Marukame Udon shop a 5 minute walk down Kuhio Ave for lunch. There's a queue outside but it moves quickly and the food is very fresh and reasonably priced. For a more special meal, Roy's restaurant (asian fusion cooking) is divine, but will cost you so look up the menu before you go and book as they get sold out if you leave it too late.Uber to the airport from the hotel at 630am flight was $35 and took 15 minutes - must have been surge pricing ) however the driver said it takes longer from 7am onwards.","Wellington, New Zealand","urbanite88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",318,4.0

I had an amount of IHG Platinum Elite points, but this year they could only be used at the Express. I was a little hesitant to do this, but really I had no choice.When I showed at the hotel in the evening, it turned out I had to park in the municipal lot, which is a up the road and across the street. Small inconvenience, and actually less money than valet at the Beachcomber.On check in, I got a good room that was city-side. It was small but OK. I figured out that the high table could be lowered to become a work table. All the amenities were there and in place. Pretty much IHG standard, and good.What changed my opinion and really made the trip special was interaction with the staff in the lobby. On check in, a gentleman was more than willing to cart my luggage upstairs while I parked. But the next day, when I mentioned to hotel personnel about how I missed the Beachcomber, I was offered a vacant room that was fortunately available, and offered a spectacular view of southern Waikiki! It may be because I am Platinum Elite on IHG, or maybe because of my frequent visits last year to Beachcomber, but the gesture by management really just made me feel like the whole operation cared about my four-day stay at the hotel. They really wanted to make it a positive experience for me.I can name the manager but I don't want to embarrass. She was really excellent.I recommend this hotel as IHG's only property that it manages on Oahu. Not sure why the Beachcomber went to another brand, but IHG's people are working really hard to make customers feel at home at the Holiday Inn Express. It is a couple hundred yards south of the buzz going on on Kalakaua Avenue, the main drag of Waikiki. But everything the hotel does, in my view, is to create a positive stay for you in the resort neighborhood of Honolulu.""Express"" is a budget-type offering of IHG. But the people (and the people ---the employees----really make a hotel) have taken the extra step to make a budget offering a really positive thing. There are a number of ""extras"" at the hotel, pools and what have you, but it was a business trip and I didn't get to check them out.When I am in Oahu, I would not hesitate to stay at the Holiday Inn Express again.

This hotel knows exactly how to accommodate guests. I was in dire need of rest and relaxation and I got exactly that at this hotel. Everything... I mean everything was perfect and the staff are exceptional. I arrived from Canada on an overnight flight to Honolulu and showed up early in the AM at the Holiday Inn after staying at a horrific hotel near the airport. Although I was early and my room wasn't ready, the hotel happily tagged my bags and hung on to them for me while I waited which gave me a chance to explore the area. When the room was ready, I was impressed at how clean it was and the view was unreal. But what really made this hotel shine was how everyone you came in contact with in the hotel was really happy to assist in any way they could to make sure you had everything you needed.The cleaning ladies gave me extra coffee (since I am a big coffee drinker) and was so friendly and polite. The staff at guest service who recommends trip packages were incredibly helpful in helping me pick out the right Hawaiian experience I would enjoy and I did. I ended up taking the Surf Bus and had the time of my life. It provided me a day full of activities and back in time to catch my bus back to the airport.The front desk reservation agents were just outstanding, super helpful and baggage handlers were funny and always put a smile on my face. They also hung on to my luggage even though I checked out so I wouldn't be carrying around my bags all day until I left for my flight. I never stayed at a hotel that did this before so it was such a pleasant surprise.What makes a hotel shine is really the people that work there. I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed my stay. There was plenty to do in the hotel from foozeball, table tennis, a big chess board, a putting green, beautiful pool and hot tub with comfortable loungers and covered private loungers as well. The lobby was open and spacious. Offered a decent continental breakfast (although very little vegan options).The hotel is also located within a 10 minute walk to the beach, 5 minutes to shopping, and in a safe and clean neighbourhood.

First of all, I detest resort fees and try hard not to give my business to hotels that charge them, especially when parking isn't thrown in with the fee. Having said that, my only complaint is the room was slightly smaller than I expected, with a noisy A/C unit, and a corner configuration for the rooms which meant that 4 rooms, and the doors and occupants in them, are only a few feet away. Could hear lots of slamming doors and loud talking at certain times when people were getting ready for the day.On the plus side, excellent breakfast and the area where you eat has indoor and outdoor tables. So nice to eat January breakfast outdoors under a palm tree!

Jeremy and Lana and also the tall guy who speaks Korean were really great. The housekeeping staff are honest and keep the rooms clean. My husband left an expensive set of headphones in the room when we checked out and the maid turned them in so we were able to get them back.If you are looking for a hotel with a room with a balcony this is not the hotel for you. None of the rooms have a balcony. The rooms are on the small size and be aware that if you pay extra for a partial sea view check the position of the bed, otherwise the only way you can see the sea is from the one chair or to stand by the window. Some of the partial sea views from the bed are blocked by the air conditioner unit. The bathroom fan is noisy, but can be turned off so that was not a problem. The air conditioner is very effective, too much so when your bed is next to it. There was some door slamming during our stay but not late at night which was great.Breakfast is plentiful and there is seating on the patio if you want to sit outside They change out the selection of hot food about every three days. If you are travelling with teenage boys this is the breakfast for them as there is plenty of choice. Avoid the juice as it is not the best tasting. If you want a coffee to go you have to get a to go cup from the the desk where they check your breakfast tickets.There is a very small adult depth pool basically to cool off certainly not for laps, and a small child's pool plus a small miniature golf and shuffleboard. Parking cost $29 a day and there is a sensor that knows that you are entering and leaving so you don't need to use your room key. It also often says full but this is only for non hotel guests. It is about a seven minute walk to the beach and you are allowed to have a beach chair and umbrella one time during your stay free of charge. This was really nice even if it was a pain to lug them to the beach. There are restaurants within walking distance and also shops to buy supplies. The room has a micro wave and refrigerator plus an in room safe which is nice.Be aware that next to the concierge there is another marked Maps and Information. This is a Wyndham time share set up. Despite the allure of a free stay at a Wyndham property if you visit their time share in Waikiki you will have difficulty redeeming the thank you reward.All in all this was good value for the money but maybe next time I will stay somewhere else and pay a little more money to have a balcony.","Madison, Alabama","Deb1144</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Alabama</strong>",90,4.0

They are extremely noisy and you cannot leave them on if you want to sleep. We were just lucky not to stay longer than two nights. They are fitted at the head of the second bed and sound like something from the 1970's.

Our price included a continental breakfast but to our surprise it included everything a full buffet at any other hotel. For the kids there was ample here to keep them occupied: games room, roof top table tennis, giant chess and mini golf WOW! The pool set up made us feel like were at a New York Hotel, very cool. The only thing missing was a cocktail bar. The beach was a short walk approximately 10 minutes. Great hotel to stay a few days but I wouldn't recommend any more than a few nights and thats only because you won't sleep with those noisy air conditioners!

Most people probably take a shuttle or some other sort of transportation from the airport, and as I said the area is very built up. When I get to the main lobby, I find out that my advance purchase on my credit card did not cover everything! Parking was around $30 a day, and I understand not charging that up front since many people do not use it (and this follows other properties), however the $20 resort fee I had no idea even existed until I saw my bill! I would have figured that would have been in the online rate, as it is mandatory. I get my key and take my bag to the 30th floor. Speaking of which, there are two sets of elevators: one set is for the lower rooms, the other is for the higher rooms, but both access the lobby, parking garage, and laundry. However, the 5th floor which has the resort activities can only be accessed from one set of evevators. This means if I wanted to use the area (more on that later), I have to go down to the third floor, then back up to the fifth. Very odd.The room is extremely cramped, as in smaller than a hospital room. This is far much smaller than any Holiday Inn Express I have stayed at. The air conditioning is also loud and runs constantly, the latter may be because of the high floor. It was in the 80s during the day and 70s at night. The bathroom is very small as well, which isn’t too big of a deal for me, but can be if you have more than one person staying there.I had a partial ocean view, which was very nice to see. It would have been nice to have a balcony. TV selection is a little weak, but I didn’t watch much. The bed and sleep quality are fine.Breakfast is down in an area off of the lobby and is very crowded due to the high number of guests. Seating is both inside and outside on the patio, I chose the latter. You do need a coupon to enter the breakfast area, as the hotel is wide open and anyone could walk in and get a free meal otherwise. Honolulu apparently has a decent sized homeless problem, so I can see why they did this.I only went to the activity area on the fifth floor on the last day before driving to the airport. There is an outdoor pool and spa, a few holes of mini golf (with not the best equipment), foosball, and a giant sized chess game. There is a room with video games and exercise equipment. The hotel also has a staff where they can arrange trips and such for you, so I am guess this is where some of the $20 a day goes towards.I understand the pricing since it is a resort and it is Honolulu, but I would hope more would be offered, especially a larger room. If you are claustrophobic, this is not the place for you. I plan on flying to Hawaii again in the next five years, however I am not sure if I would stay here again, or even on Oahu. From what little I saw of the Big Island on a day trip, I may stay there.I do recommend renting a car at the airport, so you can explore more of Oahu. If you have time, try to see at least one other island. This requires flying which isn’t cheap.","Wayne, Michigan","Keith B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wayne, Michigan</strong>",31,3.0

She was very pleasant and thorough. We were given our room right away with a good view of Diamond Head and partial ocean views. The staff we met were all very helpful and courteous, including the local travel representative. Unfortunately, we had to cut our 4 night stay into 2. The room, though small has everything we need and the bed was comfortable for our taste. However, the air conditioner made it impossible for us to get a good night’s rest. It is one of those very old models and since the room is small, it made its presence VERY, VERY LOUD. I’m a light sleeper so we turned it off the first night and cracked the window open to let natural air come in. It was a cool night by Hawaii standard but very uncomfortable for us. I brought it to the attention of the front desk the following morning and they sent someone to “fix” it along with the broken safe. The safe was fixed but the air conditioning system remained unchanged. We again had to turn it off just so we could sleep on the 2nd night. To make the matters worst, there must have been some sort of an incident because all we can hear are police sirens throughout the night. We had to shut the window again and be miserable with no air conditioner on. I think we managed to dose off around 2 AM from pure exhaustion. We missed our early morning tour the following day because we couldn’t get up on time. We brought all of this concerns to JT, the manager on duty. He was very understanding and very generous with how he resolved our issue. We left and went to another hotel, exhausted from lack of sleep but still felt that we were treated fairly and kindly. If you are a light sleeper, this hotel won’t work for you. If noise is not a problem and you are used to sleeping with a white noise background, this hotel is a good place to stay. The free continental breakfast is simple but ample. Despite the huge traffic they get in the mornings, there always seem to be tables available and the food promptly replenished when empty.

There are 3 service lines but they dont work in a linear fashion and are difficult to get through and cramped. Food tasted great each day and was free.Wifi was mostly good. A few periods of very slow service but generally reliable.Noise from outside was medium. We could hear peoples doors slam but then nothing after they went into their rooms.The cons. The rooms were so much tinier than we expected. We had a hard time finding places to store a total of 5 bags and be able to access them. There is no real work station just a small table that doesnt fit above the bed due to the metal skirt. I had to use it standing in a corner and we could barely squeeze past it when it was not in use.The 2 big issues were 1. Air conditioner. Ridiculously loud with strong cold air flow. Wall unit did not consistently change the setting and we were never really able to get temp or air flow we were after.2. Bathroom door is frosted glass. If someone uses the restroom in the middle of the night they might as well turn on all the lights in the room. This was a huge problem for my stay.We did not use the recreation amenities.Overall if i came again i would likely at least look somewhere else but this hotel was clean safe and featured free breakfast and free wifi so i would not rule it out either.","Peoria, Illinois","hikerkidz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peoria, Illinois</strong>",103,3.0

The rooms are very European in size (small), but clean and the beds comfortable. The addition of a mini fridge, microwave and Keurig coffee machine are a nice touch. The complimentary breakfast on offer is ample and varied in choice. There is something there to appease all palates: 2 choices readymade omelets, turkey or pork sausage patties, pancakes, milk- whole, skim, chocolate or soy etc etc. I was impressed by the cleanliness, the swiftness in restocking, and the friendly staff - especially Andy. I stayed at this location many yrs ago when it was then known as the Maile Sky Court. The rebranding and total overhaul are commendable. The staff are the realstars!

The bed was comfortable as well. Wifi worked great throughout the hotel. The main and jacuzzi pool were clean with ample lounges and umbrellas around. They were all new and of high quality too. However, being on the higher floor, it required you to take the very slow elevator down to lobby first then take another slow elevator back up to the pool level on the 5th floor.When we checked in, our A/C did not work well.

After two nights, we resorted to hanging some clothes in front of it to divert the air. In addition, the A/C unit was very noisy and would turn on and off throughout the night.

It also has a work out room on that deck which is awesome which you is very clean.  The room was not ready when I arrived but then again I arrive four hours early But they accommodate me and check my bags and off I went to explore horrible. The service was fantastic and the check in went smooth with help from to customer service reps at the front desk or nothing but extremely polite and fabulous the room was a little small but other than that very clean very nice but again small and with that recently refurbished hotel they install doors that are super thick and slam shut very hard but my room had an excellent view so I really didn't care.  Very centrally located we're cool he'll meet scholar, in the beginning ABC store on the corner and a seven minute walk to the international marketplace maybe 10 at the most it is perfect to get to the beach is right by Fort de Russo and the park and the Honolulu central Post Office.So what were the shortcomings? Well even though it had a nine hole golf course which is really fun and cool and the deck was nice the pool leaves a little bit to be desired small and very crowded did you Cousy is huge but again also very crowded. Half the deck is unused and it would've been better for the engineers to put in a bigger pool and less chair so I empty instead of a small pool and tons of chairs but again for the price tag it was a great stay for a long vacation maybe not again the holiday in express Honolulu has been renovated and is in great shape and the highlight was definitely the breakfast is included and it is huge it has everything you could ever want from full on pancake making machines to a light European breakfast fresh fruit for different types of juices yogurts everything under the sun eggs sausage you name it they got it definite highlight.

Not sure I would during a windy storm though, but otherwise a nice concept. TJ checked me in and was wonderful during my entire stay. He helped me with bus routes and when I left my CC at the Hard Rock. And he was fun to talk to. He's an asset to the hotel. Since the hotel is re-modeled everything is clean and comfortable. The mattress was amazing. The TV in the room is unnecessarily huge but I loved it with all the available channels.I liked having a refrigerator to hold cold items. I never had long waits for the elevators like some complain about. The breakfast is typical HI Express. 3 Days is fine. Anymore and it's boring. The location is good. Near the end of the strip and just off many bus lines.The bad: The rooms are small. I mean REALLY small. Been to Tokyo or Hong Kong? Those are large in comparison. There is no work desk and chair. There is a table that fits over the bed like in a hospital. The window air-conditioner is not going to make people happy as it blows on the beds. Maybe cover with a pillow sheet? Also, I could not find a suitable outlet to charge my computer. After 10 minutes I pulled out a panel under the air-conditioner and found a socket. The pool is a joke. Way too small and half is 3 feet and half is 6 feet. So watch out. Why build a 9 hole putting green when you could have had a massive pool for such a huge hotel I'll never figure out. Not everyone spends the days at the beach, Tip- I had no problem with the air-conditioner because I had a room with 2 double beds. So I slept on the bed that had no air blowing on it. It's very possible my rating for this hotel would be lower if I had air blowing on me the whole time. So keep that in mind. The Ugly: There is a sign that says ""Concierge"" but that man at the desk is not there to make reservations or give directions. He's there to sell tours. And there's nothing wrong with that. Just change the sign to ""Tour Desk"". The deceptive sign is just wrong. Next to him is a desk that says ""Maps and information"". I have no idea what they are there for. Yes they gave me a map but seemed to have zero interest in giving me information and help.

The breakfast in the morning was very good with plenty of selection, however, staying multiple nights the breakfasts do tend to become too repetitive.

But the rooms are still cramped; conversations with other guests about their rooms had them rolling their eyes too.The hotel's laughable solution is to put in a mobile table over the bed to save space, but that is negated by a an executive-style chair that is too big for the room and has no wheels. It blocked access to one side of the room and could be pushed aside only with a mighty effort, risking injury to one's back. What were they thinking?On the plus side, the rooms were kept clean and the buffet breakfasts were generous if monotonous over a two-week stay, and the hotel is located relatively close to Ala Moana shopping center and beach park. On the negative side, in addition to the cramped rooms (about 12 x 12 ft), the parking garage ($27/day!) was dark and finding an scarce empty space in it at night was a roll of the dice, and some spaces had water dripping on them from leaking pipes on the ceiling. Because of the lack of spaces, some cars were allowed to park in areas that were hazardous for other drivers to pass. Other drawbacks include the slow elevators; besides long waits for elevators to arrive, guests have to change elevators to reach certain floors, including the floors with the pool and gym; very inconvenient. Also, as far as I could tell, there were ice machines on only three floors of the 44-floor hotel.Finally, in a breach of security, a staff member alarmingly walked in on me one day without knocking or any announcement, and only mumbled an apology when I followed him out and questioned him; I reported the intrusion to management but never received an explanation of what he was doing there.",,blokototerminous,93,2.0

The line for check-in was very long, though it was reasonable for the elite line (I am platinum). The cleanliness of the room was sub par: when we arrived in the room, half the pillows were stained, and the armchair was covered in sand.The room was otherwise nice, with a great view. Breakfast was simple but all right, I was afraid considering how crowded the hotel was that it would be too hectic but it was fine as the breakfast room is big. It's a shame that the breakfast only runs until 9am, which is quite early if you want to have a relaxing time in Hawaii. The side effect of this was that it was next to impossible to get onto an elevator to go down just before 9, that could easily take 20 minutes until you got one. The swimming pool was probably big enough for 2 or 3 people to swim at the same time, or maybe up to a dozen to stand, which is ridiculous for a 44-story hotel.Anyway, all of this is barely relevant in regards to the incident we had: a security officer came banging at our door 5 minutes before midnight shouting ""security! Open your door!"". When I asked him to slip his ID through the crack of the door he refused, saying I should be able to see it through the peephole (I barely could see there was an ID on him). When I asked him why I should trust he is who he claims and open the door, his reply was that I would otherwise be charged with trespassing (yes, he really said that!). He also refused to tell me the reason of his visit. After a while when he seemed calmer I agreed to open the door, and only after I let him in did he tell me the reason of his late and threatening visit: the neighbors downstairs saw a little bit of water trickling down from their ceiling. He wanted to come in to check if we had any flooding, saw that there was none, and said a bunch of bad things about the owners and how they don't have a good upkeep of their plumbing.The silver lining is that the next day when I came to complain at the front desk, Gladys received my complaint and acknowledged how unacceptable that is and handled the situation very kindly and professionally. She agreed to discount one night from our trip, though as we booked on points it will have to come in the form of point reimbursement through IHG, for which I am still waiting almost a month later.",,guijemont,3,1.0

They will even box up your breakfast to take back to your room. You can pick up a daily newspaper in the breakfast room.There is a very small pool, not really suitable for swimming but suitable for soaking with it's chilled water, and a spa that's about half the size of that. The pool deck is very nice for laying out on, with many comfortably padded lounges and a number of sheltered cabanas. For the kids, old and young alike, there's a 9 Hole mini golf course, a giant chess board, ping pong, and shuffleboard. Just off the pool deck there is a game room with Wii's for electronic gaming. The hotel has a small but adequately equipped exercise room but, really, you're in Hawaii--get your exercise walking or hiking.I encountered no problems during my stay, but I did have a slight issue adjusting the table in the room.

The staff was nice for the most part and tried to assist in every way possible. It's centrally located so you can walk everywhere. Now, the bad: rooms are REALLY small! I had a king size bed and there was maybe 3-4 ft of walking space on all sides. The bathroom is even smaller and awkward. You can't really get to the sink because the wall is in the way. For what they charge you in resort fees, the pool is extremely small and the ""spa"" is even smaller. The mini golf was neat but eh, still not that impressive.

Located in Waikiki on Namahana street. The check-in process was easy and quick. I was able to check in early which was a blessing. The parking rate was a bit steep, $27 a night, and if you get in late at night, you may have to creep into the garage as you wind around cars parked or crammed into every spot that they can fit their vehicle into. The rooms are small, but if you dont plan on spending too much time in your room, then it wont matter. The rooms are clean, and it includes a microwave and refrigerator. The front desk clerk named ""Lave"" knows how to deliver friendly customer service. He was patient and listened to my request and he took the time to see if he could accommodate my family. The laundry facilities on the third floor was convenient. The game room, pool, hot tub and exercise room on the fifth floor was a BIG hit with my kids! The icing on the cake for our stay at the Holiday Inn Express Waikiki is their awesome Breakfast Buffet. The unlimited Pancakes, juice, cinnamon roles, yogurt, omelettes, etc, made this place our ""go to"" hotel whenever we island hop to O'ahu.

Average to good location - the beach is about 0.5 miles straight through the park past Fort DeRussey. It's an easy, shaded walk. The hotel is about that same distance from the heart of Waikiki dining and shopping on Kalakaua Ave and the International Market Place. If you're ok with a bit of walking then you're fine. There's not a lot to do right by the hotel like others in Waikiki like the Hilton and Marriott brands. Then again, that's likely why you get such a good price. We didn't mind the walk to the beach, shopping or dining.Good breakfast - probably the best feature is the free breakfast with pre-made omeletes, sausage, gravy, biscuits, pancakes, bagels, cinnamon rolls, cereals, yogurts. It seems to stay busy. Prepare for a line at the door when it opens at 6:30AM. Great activity options on the 5th floor - putt putt, large chess board, foosball, ping pong, shuffle board, pool and hot tub. This was probably the second best thing about this hotel. Not that clean - I'm not sure they vacuumed our room in 10 days. The bathroom floor looked pretty dirty from day one. Parking is tight - don't plan on parking in the garage if you return to the hotel in the evening; it'll likely be full. They will reimburse your day in the hotel garage if you have to park offsite, but it's more a matter of convenience for us and we didn't want to,have to park somewhere else and have to go move the car the next morning. Also, people park along the walls making it impossible for two cars going in opposite directions to get through. It's tight enough already without the added pain of parking along the walls. Elevators can take a while - there are six elevators for 44 floors. Three elevators service the top floors while the other three elevators service the bottom half . All six elevators service the lobby through the third floor. They were many, many instances where an elevator would finally come to our floor, but it would be full so you had to wait another few minutes for the next one. It took us nearly ten minutes to get from the 33rd floor to the lobby on occasion. Oh, the elevators get HOT and when crowded it's not super enjoyable mSmall room - our room was small enough, but felt extra crowded with two queen beds, the chair and the small table. Probably the tightest space we've dealt with in a hotel room since Venice or London. Room with a view - higher floors mean longer elevator rides, but if you get a corner room on a high floor with a view of the beach and mountains you will appreciate it. Bottom line - if on a budget, stay here and save even more by taking advantage of the free breakfast. If you can spend another $50-$100 a day, then opt for a hotel in a slightly better location and one with more resort-like amenities. We already planned our next trip to Honolulu and picked a different hotel. We decided to go with a hotel closer to the center of Waikiki and closer to the beach.","Denver, Colorado","ripcordzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",78,3.0

It was cute, but alot of extra money for something that didn't get used. Ping pong on a roof top where it was consistently windy-again, riddiculous. The money you spent on this activity area should have been used for an adult pool or a kids pool. Sitting in a hot tub with kids constantly jumping in and splashing you, not so relaxing.While the staff was friendly, they weren't so helpful. Helping with bus/trolley schedule-not so knowledgeable.

Our room # 4410 (partial view of Ocean, topmost floor) was just as promised - with a partial view of the canal to the left, Diamond Head volcano in front view and partial view of the ocean to the right. The room was clean, the bedspreads and pillows all crisp white and the bed was very comfortable. Some reviews have found HIE rooms small but since we had only backpacks and one carry-on, the room size didn't bother us. Those of you with multiple luggage might find it small. The air condition was loud as many reviewers have said, but it is effective and at the time we were there (June 4-June 11), it was pretty humid so we welcomed its full blast.The hotel's complimentary breakfast was great - Apart from sugary cinnamon buns, muffins, sliced bread and bagels, there were machines churning out pancakes. There were also eggs, sausages, hot and cold cereals, milk, yogurt, juices, fruits (bananas and apples), tea and coffee. What more you want?The hotel pool is small, but then who wants to be in the pool when you have the ocean to swim. There is also a Jacuzzi. I didn't use the pool until the last day when I had some time to kill before check-out. There is an outdoor play area next to the pool and a gym somewhere in the building which I didn't bother to look. The hotel also has laundry facility which I didn't use. There is a small convenience store in the lobby that came in handy when I wanted some chilled bottled water.Overall a great experience. The newly renovated hotel felt fresh and contemporary, the staff very friendly (as we found all Hawaiians to be that way in general) and budget-friendly in expensive Hawaii. One complaint though - the hotel driveway is very small. When a driver in front of you parks and disappears or someone is offloading luggage, the car behind it gets stuck. Hope the hotel management sees to it that there is someone assigned to better manage the drop-off, pick-up situation there. Hawaii is such a beautiful place and the hotel only helped in making our first time experience there a memorable one. We will certainly be back. Thank you, HIE!

The rooms are a little small but the way they furnished them made them perfectly acceptable. We had a refrigerator and a microwave as well as Keurig coffee maker. We were on one of the higher floors and the views of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head were incredible. Well worth the few extra dollars to have those views. The have a pool located on the 5th floor of the building which was very well done and on the same area they have a miniature golf course, shuffle board, a great big chess set, fuse ball and ping pong! Not sure about the ping pong, a little too windy to play outdoors. They also had a game room on the same floor with WI games and TV’s!The best part was the breakfast that comes with the room for free! They have these pancake machines that you just press a button and you can watch them being made, takes about 30 seconds! In addition to that they have a full breakfast buffet with fruit, eggs, cereal, everything!The staff was very friendly, smiling and helpful.

It's so nice they priced me out of it for this years stay. From the picture I have seen of the new lobby it appears many of the former Aqua staff have stayed on. And hears lies the problem. Since Aqua took over several years ago they constantly try to down grade the type of room one pays for. I have had to argue with them every year. Last year I was delayed by my flight and then the airport shuttle was over booked and I had about a two hour wait at the Honolulu Airport. It was one in the morning when I checked in. They tried to give me one of their cheapest rooms although I booked what was called a Deluxe Ocean View. Those are the corner rooms facing Diamond Head and the ocean. After demanding the phone number of the corporate office to call at 8AM they found their mistake and assigned me the nicest room in the hotel on the 44th floor. It wasn't as if they didn't know me, they greeted me when I arrived by name. IIf one can get passed the questionable check-in you will be very pleased with the hotel.

Surprised our 13 year old for his birthday; from Molokai, so anything off island is great! Well upon check in, we didn't get any kind of special welcoming except ""hi! Next pls?"" Went straight to the point on hotel fees ($20 each day+tax), parking fees ($27 each day+tax) on top of a $100 hold after paying in full of just under $500 for only (2) nights; and info on breakfast. We paid for a ocean view and receptionist originally was going to place us in a partial ocean view on 24th floor. I asked about our ocean view room and she said ""let me see, there is one available on 35th floor, so I'll upgrade you!"" How is it a upgrade to ocean view when I payed for it in the first place? Carrying on, confused on our ""free upgrade"" and disappointed on fees after fees, we got to the room and was really happy with our corner room with ocean view! I must say it was beautiful despite a really squishy room but that didn't bother us because it was nicely laid out to good use. Bed and pillows was okay, but A/C was very loud and obnoxious at night. It was hard to sleep and stay asleep. Breakfast in the dining area was really nice and food options were good too! However, the older Caucasian lady collecting tickets was something else... I left to use the bathroom, I came back in she says very loudly ""Ma'am, Ma'am?"" I turned around and told her ""I just went to use the bathroom, I was already in here eating."" She says, ""well you need to let me know..."" Last time I needed to ASK PERMISSION"" to use the bathroom was in elementary school. After, My 13 year old and husband went to use the bathroom and was not told anything by that lady... um okay... not sure what that was about. Other than that, our stay was okay. Store across the street was pretty good with lots of options for your personal needs. Hotel was nicely decorated with pretty color accents and furniture! Made good use of water machine in lobby. My husband forgot his shaving cream and shaver at home but hotel provided these items for free! We plan on coming back this coming up week on May 17-19 to surprise our other son for his birthday, so we're hoping to have a ""great experience"" all around! We'll see how this visit goes... Fyi, I payed through third party for this upcoming visit because I feel the price I payed last time was not adequate based on this past experience. The discounted rate will make me feel not so cheated like last. I'll be posting a review after next visit, stay tuned...

We loved it. We have stayed at other Holiday Inn Express and just found what they offer to be great. The rooms did not seem all that small to me as I have stayed in smaller and had spent 18 nights on a cruise ship prior. There was plenty of space to move around with plenty of space for baggage as well. Bathroom was small but the shower was huge which I did love. Only down side about the room is the air conditioner, it is very noisy and old but not to much of an issue. We had a room on the 39th floor looking over the Canal and the beach was stunning! beds are also super comfy. Breakfast was great, the cinnamon rolls are AMAZING! can i get some sent to Australia please haha. Heaps on offer sausage, eggs, breads, pastries, cinnamon scrolls, cereals, fruits really great offering and not crazy busy. Staff are lovely, we arrived at 9am on a Friday and expected to be told to come back for check in (which would have been fine) but our room was ready to go which was fantastic! The outside area is super fun with mini golf, giant chess, pool, spa, gym and plenty of sun lounges to lounge around. Only about a 5 minute walk to Waikiki its self plenty of food options around the hotel as well if you don't feel like walking. Only issue we encountered at one point the front desk must have cut our room key for someone else as they did walk into our room, was a little awkward, but not an issue.

It is located at the beginning (west end) of Waikiki with easy access to Ala Moana and the rest of Waikiki. Rooms are tiny, with the beds taking up much of the roughly 250 sq ft room, no lanai, and low ceilings. Windows do not open and the the room is cooled via individual a/c units, which are quite noisy. Being 40+ stories, the higher levels offer commanding views of the ocean and mountain, around level 25 will clear most of the surrounding buildings.Breakfast was a cattle call. While the restaurant was large with indoor and outdoor seating, so were the patrons. With 40+ stories and 16 units per level, you can imagine the breakfast crowd. Despite this, the food choices were very respectable and well stocked, with decent pre-made omelets, bacon or sausage (rotated on odd/even days), a pancake making machine (slow, so-so pancakes, but cool to watch), pastries/breads/cereals, limited uncut fruit, juices, and coffee.Lobby was spacious and bright. Front desk was overwhelmed with the volume. Despite being a higher tiered IHG member and making my reservations on their website, they couldn't find my reservation, i needed to dig out my confirmation number, and could not offer a late checkout. Garage was a bit filthy and an automated gate with license plate reader which worked on occasion. $27 self parking. $20 convenience fee, not sure what this is for, maybe to cover breakfast? I guess they couldn't call it a resort fee, being several blocks from the beach.Good for short stays on a budget, any longer, the room is a bit too claustrophobic.
