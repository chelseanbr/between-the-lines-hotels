The noise of the elevator should not be a new problem, but they told me ""we have chosen a very nice room for you! Enjoy your stay!"". I did not sleep well the first night wondering what that noise was, but too lazy to pack everything and call front desk to change room at late night. The second night I called the front desk to change room, she was surprised how loud it was since she could hear the noise even from the phone. I think the right thing to do is: if that was the only room left, they should have told me about this condition, instead of hoping I wouldn't notice. If this was not the only room left, then an alternative room should have been prioritized. Since this was not what happended, I can only infer that either the person who checked me in didn't know the situation of the elevator, which makes him not a professional employee, or he did this on purpose to get rid of a bad room, which is even more unacceptable.

I’m a solo adult traveler who used to live in New York so I can’t speak from a true tourist perspective. But I think the location is excellent. You’re south of the midtown connection, but shopping and conveniences is only around the corner (DSW, Nordstrom Rack, MAC, Whole Foods a block away, higher end only a few more). Subway station is both local and express stop so easy to get around). And taxis are about as plentiful there as you’re going to get most times of day). I usually prefer something in Soho or Tribeca like Soho Grand or Sixty Thompson but I found this hotel have a cozier more personal feel than you’d associate with a big chain. I liked the fact there was enough space in the lobby to meet a friend or sit for a moment plus a full restaurant and bar. The room was not particularly remarkable with regard to decor, but I still thought definitely better than average. Love that you can still get a coffee maker in the room. Tiny niggling thing was I wish they’d update outlets to have more USB ports. Pharmacopia amenities were great, bed was comfortable, room size was pretty good for New York, I’ve definitely, definitely, paid more for smaller. Room service burger and fries were very good. Far and away the front desk staff was great. I wish I had caught their names. (Whoever was on desk from 13-19 December.).

This Hyatt has been very clever with their limited space and created what feels like a spacious room through streamlined, efficient design. My king room featured a robe and slippers, and an umbrella just in case. The ""closet"" is actually an in-room wardrobe with space to hang but no drawers to store smaller things, so I folded and piled my non-hangables on the taller part of the closet that held the safe and a smaller drawer below that (drawer-height, minus the drawers). Wall hooks by the door were a nice place to store my coat and purse. There are a lot of outlets in all the right places, the stand-up shower was spacious and modern with ok pressure and consistent temperature control. There is a sideboard-type table that holds a fridge on one side and the coffee maker on the other (mine was broken but they sent up a free pot in the morning and got me a replacement the next day). Real glass glasses (two sizes plus two wine glasses), a wine opener, and a nice desk setup helped make the space feel pretty cozy. There aren't a lot of surfaces to set things without clutter quickly taking over, but there is a bench seat as well as a desk chair and a carry-on stows nicely in the area under the TV.Cons: The blackout curtain didn't lay flush with the walls so my east-facing window bled sunshine on my last morning (fortunately, it had been cloudy most of the trip). The pillows are down and a little too firm for my taste, and the HVAC doesn't run constantly so if you are a light sleeper, BRING A NOISE MACHINE OR AN APP because NYC is loud all the time. The hotel knows this, so earplugs are provided in the valet kit on the sink. Not much neighbor noise at all but the street is always going. My noise machine worked like a charm.I was alone on business but I can't imagine trying to stay here with another person. There's exactly enough room for one person's stuff for a short amount of time. This hotel is not for long stays, in my opinion. I will stay here again when I travel back to NYC though, it was perfect for me.Close to all public transit, a block from Union Square, and perfectly located for nice long walks to Midtown and the Village. Also, points for both a Trader Joe's and a Whole Foods mere blocks away.","Columbus, Ohio","ChiColPen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",1,4.0

The bed was incredibly comfortable, blackout shades for privacy and light blocking. I usually can’t sleep in the city with all of the noise, but given the location of Hyatt Union Square I didn’t hear a thing while sleeping. There are also white noise devices in the room, comfortable fleece bathrobes, and the alarm clocks are now Bluetooth speakers with wireless charging capabilities. The Hyatt staff was warm and accommodating each time I interacted with them and had excellent advice for directions or recommending places to eat in the area. Bowery Restaurant and Library of Distilled Spirits were also terrific options and the staff was fantastic at each establishment.

The people are fantastic. I had a really curious experience at the front desk that showed their talent and commitment to service. Alisha, at the front desk, had apparently drawn the shortest straw, and was patiently taking in a woman’s unhinged rant about her treatment. She wasn’t a guest mind you. Just how the world has been treating her. Paranoid and wounded, she kept up a relentless barrage. Alisha remained patient, fair and firm with her, giving her the space to unburden herself. Things changed when the woman decided that I had made a crack about her smoking. Uh, what? And all of a sudden she was making comments about me as I waited to be checked in. This is when I saw an interesting shift in Alisha. She got very stern with the woman, and said she was not to bother our guests. The woman protested, and Alisha was having none of the fake “what? Me?”.I wasn’t exactly bothered as I understood that this woman had something going on. But Alisha made sure that the drama didn’t spill into my experience. To me, in addition to the deft people skills, it showed Alisha’s strength in personality and commitment to ensure things go smoothly for guests. It could have easily been an eye-rolling experience. Jennifer Post runs the front, and clearly does a great job, as everyone to a person, was lovely. It’s a very nicely appointed and designed hotel that fits with the neighborhood. Close to Union Square as the name suggests. Great restaurant in the building. Think Coffee across the street is excellent as well. Book with confidence.

There was no view and that was a bit disappointing for OUR very 1st time in NY but fine. The room has a slight odor hard to describe what it was but it hit you in the face when you walked into the room. The check in was slow but there were in two people there working this small lobby desk. The clerk was nice enough with a generic smile if you asked me. There was an issue with the canceling of my car from the airport, after finding out it would cost me $95 one way, I canceled the car with the HYATT but the customer agent didn’t cancel and didn’t really offer an reason why other than miscommunication. WHAT MISCOMMUNICATIONS? I Asked BRIANNA to cancel the car because I found other transportation cheaper. So, I was out of $200 for transportation and no one seemed to care. Ms. Brianna did say she called the air link transportation company and they said they would give me a partial refund but I won’t hold my breath. Ms. Brianna was a lot nicer than the young lady that checked me in though. I never got her name. The trip to NY was overwhelming too expensive and too many people. If I EVER stepped foot back into NY I would probably give the Hyatt another chance it’s close to everything and I would like a bigger room with a view.

Located right at Union Square and close to the Flatiron district, the hotel location is the greatest plus - convenience stores such as Walgreen's are just steps away and there are all kinds of great restaurants within walking distance. Maison Kaiser, an all-day breakfast and pastries eatery, is just a block away. There's a Starbucks about two blocks away and an all-day Chinese dim-sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan just half a block away. Reputable restaurants such as Gramercy Tavern, East 15th and the Union Square Cafe are all within walking distance.The hotel's restaurant The Bowery Club did not have good breakfast (limited menu and bad coffee) but the Cobb Salad during dinner time was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel bar is actually quite beautiful and exotic during quiet times, but for most evenings, the bar was extremely noisy particularly during weeknights. The bar does not take reservations and good luck with finding a table. Drinks were good but very expensive!At about USD$400 per night, the room was good value for money for a Manhattan Hotel. There's free Premium Wi-Fi (maybe because I'm a World of Hyatt member) everywhere for up to three devices anywhere in the hotel. I also had 2 free bottles of Evian water every day. I opted for the King-Bed room facing the Courtyard and the backs of other nearby buildings because the hotel is located near a fire station and I wanted to be free from sirens of fire trucks. The room was small but quite well equipped with sufficient closet space and drawers even with a big hotel umbrella inside the closet. The bathroom shower offered good water pressure but the water often overflowed beyond the shower stall if the door was not closed tightly. I particularly liked the edgy bathrobe with a hood - very nicely designed and hip! The King bed was comfortable but I missed my mini-fridge where I could have put my purchased fruits from Walgreen's. There was no doorman and no washroom in the lobby but front desk staff were always helpful and friendly.My only complaint was that housekeeping staff, though conscientious, did not speak English well enough to understand my specific needs. The hotel also needs to change the duvets as I've discovered a blood stain on mine one night. A renovation might also be timely as my room looked quite tired and overall lighting was too dark.Hyatt has recently changed its policy that making local calls from the room is no longer free. I never received any email about this policy change from the World of Hyatt and when I called reception, they told me it's still free. When I checked my bill prior to check-out, all my calls were charged $1 each plus telecommunications tax. When I complained that reception had told me a different story and they immediately apologized and took all those charges away from my bill.Location location location was the biggest attribute of this hotel. Overall I was quite happy with my stay and would definitely consider going back on my next trip.","Toronto, Canada","KoKo2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",14,4.0

Btw I was also told the fan speed in the room can’t be adjusted on the top floors (over a period of 24 hrs received various versions) and while I was “parked” in another room for 4hrs the speed was easily adjustable. So either full blowing A/C in your face while you sleep or turning it off are the only two options supposedly for the top floor. Very disappointed how staff handled solutions. Only one manger from maintenance was somewhat helpful after we can back to a 90 degree room with heat running full speed (after I was supposedly fixed).

Staff was courteous and overall service was good. F&B is provided by a 3rd party contractor that does only a mediocre job. This is a drawback to this hotel because the contractor does not have ""Hyatt standards"". The problem I had was trusting the 4-hour Express dry cleaning service. I double-checked with Guest Services that 4 hours was ""in play"" before submitting slacks I needed for that evening. I was assured I would receive the order in 4 hours. I did not receive the dry cleaning in 4 hours, or 5 hours, or even that entire evening. They were brought to me the next morning a 6.30am - knocking on my door and waking me up despite my ""do not disturb"" sign. That was very frustrating as nothing annoys me more than being promised something that can't be delivered. It would have been better to tell me 4 hours was not available.

Union Square subways and tons of restaurants right outside the door. And the hotel is pretty modern. I was placed in a small room (about average for NYC) on the top floor (top 2 floors have larger windows than the rest and get considerably more light). The wifi was quite poor (worked better in the hallway) and the phone didn't work. Obviously a telecom problem in the room, but the lady at the front desk seemed determined to get it to work. After some back and forth (and several trips to the lobby since the phone didn't work), I requested a room change. What I got was a downgraded room (disappointing given the problem was with the hotel) on a lower floor that is much louder than the previous room, but hey the wifi works well... But of course there's a loud family with a crying baby in the next room with a connecting door located next to the bed that isn't blocking much noise at all. Between the loud street noise and poor sound control within the hotel, I would suggest people sensitive to noise not stay here.","New York, NY","bkph02</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",15,3.0

Booked rooms more than a month in advance. We needed two connecting rooms so called them to ensure this. First response was a usual for hotel chains “we cannot guarantee you connecting rooms but will do our best”. After some discussion I was assured that we would get connecting rooms and I received an email confirming this. A week before our arrival called to confirm and this is when some issues started - once you have a reservation, it is basically impossible to talk to a live representative-all automated responses. Tried to reach a representative a day before arrival - same result. And of course when we arrived (was not late at night) - we heard from the front desk “we gave all connecting rooms to other guests”. I tried to explain to the front desk person that we had booked in advance, showed her the email confirmation but this was useless. She was so rude and did not even try to pretend that she cared and wanted to help. She actually started lecturing me how hotels around the world worked and none could guarantee connecting rooms and some other non-sense. I asked to talk to the manager on duty. Same result (at least he was not rude). Finally he promised to move us to connecting rooms next day (we booked for 5 nights). Of course nothing happened next day. They really do not care and this is not a cheap hotel to explain such attitude. Hotel itself is ok but regular rooms are really small and “courtyard” view is ugly and depressing even on high floor like 8. Housekeeping was ok.

I chose it because despite some of the negatives, it had a location that was good for me. I'm so glad I did. It was perfect. I was in town on business and also to visit my daughter who goes to school in the area. It was so nice to be in a quieter spot (versus Times Square area) and to walk around outside without being in the middle of chaos. I felt super safe and welcomed. The staff was extremely nice. Yes, the room was a bit small but not stupidly so. If I had one more person with me, we could manage but it would be tight. For a solo work trip it was just perfect. I LOVED my room with the terrace. Highly recommend. Ear plugs in cute little pouch on pillow was a nice touch but I didn't need them. Rooms and bathrooms were updated nicely. Pocket doors allow for more room in the bathroom and they don't skimp on towels. Slippers and nice robe for use. I read reviews that complained about the housekeeping. They leave a card in the room that clearly states how often your room will be cleaned and that it can be at any time between 9-6pm. If people read that stuff they wouldn't post negative comments. Just relax and enjoy the area. I have yet to find a hotel that has everything exactly as I want it but this one does a great job. Lots of outlets and ports on the desk and side tables. Lots of lights. One block from Union Square and the whole area is just so comfortable. This is my go-to hotel for my trips to New York from now on.

The location is perfect and convenient to everything. The staff were all extremely attentive and professional. They quickly addressed and needs we had, and were always pleasant. Seriously can't say enough positive thing about the staff. We also appreciated that the common bathrooms in the lower level are gender neutral and each stall is private. Our room was very comfortable overall. As with any hotel in NYC, it is on the smaller side. The only issue was lack of storage space - we had a hard time finding ways to organize our clothes and other items. Otherwise, it felt like enough space for a couple. The bathroom is a bit awkward and might be an issue for friends traveling together. The toilet is its own room with a pocket door and there is not much sound privacy. The shower has a frosted glass door but it is not completely private and is open to the rest of the room. Our toilet room could have benefited from a deep clean, but otherwise the room felt very clean. The toiletries are CO Bigelow and smell delish. The bed was comfortable and we did not find the street noise too loud (we were on the 10th floor). We had room service a couple times; it was delicious and very fast. It is definitely on the expensive side, as was the minibar. We had to frequently ask for extra (free) coffee pods as only two were provided at a time. Also, the coffee pots were really inconsistent. Our first one stopped working altogether; we got a second one and it worked but didn't brew complete cups and leaked occasionally.We stayed in an Urbane Sky room. It was nice, but not sure it was worth the added cost. It was nice to be on a higher floor and this likely limited the amount of street noise we had.

It was a nice change from the big hotels in midtown Manhattan. Subway stops were within steps of the hotel, as was the Union Square Green Market, a Whole Foods, a great NYC bookstore, and multiple restaurants.The accommodation was okay. The decor was stylish; the room was where-do-I-put-my-bags small--perhaps not unusual for NYC. Some of the design elements in the room were not particularly well-thought-out: the closet, for instance, was so small that it could barely hold one person's hanging clothes for 2 days, much less clothing for two. The room needed more drawers; better furniture could have easily solved for that. On the plus side, there were plenty of plugs, and the lighting was well-designed.The sleep quality was average. While the bed and linens were comfortable, our room was facing the street, and the noise control was very poor. Admittedly, NYC is a loud city, but I have stayed in several properties that were better insulated against street noise. Tons of sirens, etc., all night long--if you're a light sleeper, consider staying elsewhere or at least requesting a room that does not face the street.Housekeeping was very disappointing. On the day I checked-in, soap was provided for the shower, but not for the sink. On the next day, we left the room at 9:00a; when we returned to the hotel at 2:30p, our room had still not been cleaned. I called to request housekeeping service after we left the room shortly thereafter; upon our return that evening, the service was sloppy: the bed was made, but the trash cans had been emptied and sort of thrown back into the room (rather than placed under the desk), toiletries had not been refreshed, a bag of food waste had not been removed, dirty glassware had not been replaced, etc. The pattern was similar the next day: we were given conditioner instead of lotion, etc. This poor attention-to-detail and incomplete service was surprising for a hotel of this price and brand. To management's credit, when I complained about the service, I did receive an appropriate response.While the hotel worked fine for a personal stay, had I traveled there for business, I would feel mixed. The lobby was small, with limited space to work or have conversations. At night, it was very loud, due to the lobby bar. The hotel does not have an executive lounge. Internet service was somewhat slow, although free.As a Hyatt Globalist, I was extended complimentary breakfast in the hotel's restaurant. Service here was excellent and the food satisfactory.Overall, an average stay. Given my experiences with the Hyatt brand, I expected a better experience than I had at this hotel. I would consider staying there again, but I also would not make it my first choice in NYC.","Chicago, Illinois","brmusicman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",795,3.0

We have stayed in a number of hotels, ranging from five star to barely one. We thought we had found our sweet spot with the Hyatt Union Square. We love the location and our previous couple of times had been fine. This trip however things went down hill fast. First we checked in and asked for a quiet room, preferably the same room as we have been staying in previously, 801. Floors 9-11 were closed to guess for some reason. Instead of a quiet room the front desk decided to surround us with a bus load of teenage girls who proceeded to stay up all night moving from one room to another with the music blaring. This is why it was clear no guests were put on the upper three floors. It was more convenient to crowd every floor until it was full before opening up the next one. The next day after complaining to the front desk we went out from early morning, returning around 4:30pm only to find our room still not cleaned. We are frustrated as we have to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes only to discover the bed wasn't made, the room service trays and the trash was still in the room, after we were told the room was ready.

The rooms are fairly standard for a NYC hotel - small but comfortable. The location is wonderful as there are just so many great restaurants and shops close by. Plus if you are ok with using a subway, it’s amazingly convenient since you are just a few stops from basically the entire city. The only real negative that is very hard to ignore is the room service. If you like using room service , this is not the hotel for you. We just had a horrible time getting anything right or in a timely way or they just would ignore us. Don’t understand it since the staff at the front desk seemed very nice and efficient. And the housekeeping was perfectly fine. It was really surprising since the Hyatt product is usually fairly consistent but this was just so bad its hard to fathom why they would bother with having any room service at all. Perhaps having ice machines and a small snack shop would do it and at least no one would expect anything more than that and likely would satisfy the majority of guests.We still hand a wonderful time and again potentially would stay again since the location was so great and overall we had a good experience- we would just order in from Postmates or UberEats!

Others in the elevator had the same experience. The staff was friendly and nice - seem to be happy working there and are quite pleasant and helpful. A quirky hotel that I enjoy due mostly to its location - my daughters live quite close in the neighborhood. I travel a lot for business and usually stay up at the Plaza Athenee or sometimes The Palace or the Mark. But when I am there to be with my girls the Hyatt Union Square has worked well in the past.

The staff were polite, courteous and helpful. I usually stay exclusively at Hilton Hotels being a Diamond member but this time I thought I'd try something different.Firstly, the location of this hotel is excellent.The hotel is very modern and clearly just been refurbished. The TV's are large flat screen LG's although for those who do this, I could not play films from USB key on them and had to use a HDMI lead from my laptop.We never used the bar or ate breakfast. Breakfast is VERY expensive and there is a café right over the road from the hotel called Sandwicherie which does a very good breakfast for $6.After the first night of our 7 day stay we found the housekeeping of the room to be a little sloppy having missed to clean / replace cups and glasses but this was not repeated so can be forgiven. We didn't raise this as a complaint, it was a minor misdemeanour. On another slightly negative note, when requesting some plates and cutlery to eat some cheese we purchased from a local shop, we had to request this twice as it was not delivered in the first instance.Overall it was a good stay and the best part was the location... If I am honest I'd probably stay elsewhere in future, not that there was anything wrong with the hotel but it didn't wow me.","Bedford, England, United Kingdom","StephenE113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bedford, England, United Kingdom</strong>",21,4.0

Whole Foods and Food Emporium are equally close. There's a great salad and sandwich place across the street that's open for breakfast. And there are restaurants for all budgets very close by.The hotel is new, and free of the mustiness of some of its more famous competitors. Bed and bedding are both very good. However the rooms are small. I was traveling on my own this trip, so it was fine. But if my wife had been with me we would have been tripping over each other in the narrow space between bed and desk.Shower but no bath.WiFi is ""free"", but only for the slowest speed of service. This is a bugaboo of mine; I figure if you're paying a couple of hundred bucks for a room, they can throw in an internet connection. So I stubbornly selected the Free option, and it was fine. Even with multiple devices. As the price list helpfully explains, you'll need to pay if you want video streaming (Skype, Netflix), but regular email, internet and even Netflix downloads were problem-free.Calls to Guest Services are answered promptly, and follow-up is quick.There was no sign of a doorman when I arrived, which I assumed was part of the hotel's casual atmosphere. However every other time I went out or came back, there was someone to open the door or call a taxi.My biggest complaint about the hotel is that the walls are thin and the doors are heavy. I had the misfortune to be next to a couple loudly in love, and it sounded like we were sharing a bed. Door closings are equally noisy. Bring ear plugs.While there are plusher hotels in more famous locations -- several of which I've stayed at for years -- there's a good chance I'll be back at the Hyatt Union Square on my next visit.

So comfy, I wore it around my room whilst doing email and meetings. L O V E. Besides that -it's a great location for the Union Square/Flat Iron/Shopping area. Very close (shares the same big city block) with The Strand (18 miles of book shelves people) one of the oldest and certainly largest bookstores in Manhattan. Great restaurants all around as well. Tried the in room dining (Salmon and Roasted Cauliflower dish) my first night. yum. It's more boutique like than some of the other NYC Hyatthotels I've stayed at but nice. The fitness area is decent size with multiple machines for cardio and a full weight/stretching area as well. Product in shower are great. Towels are great. My one and only beef would be the walls to the hallway are THIN you can hear every door open and close near by as if they were coming into your room. It was a little disconcerting at first, but hey it's NYC baby it should be noisy. That said - I had a window to the courtyard (806) and couldn't hear a bit of street noise. so YAY. :)","Sammamish, Washington","P_K_Richardson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sammamish, Washington</strong>",31,5.0

Then upon check in they announce loudly how you are paying for the room - don't need the world to know how much I paid, or if I used points. Then you discover the rooms are tiny with only two usable drawers and only enough space to hang your trousers if you remove a lot of stuff from the tiny closet like the ironing board.

The lobby, bar and restaurant are currently undergoing major changes - which to this 60'ish traveler will be welcomed. The current vibe is dark and art-edgy. Art-edgy but lighter and cozier would be my preference. It sounds like the bar is heading this way - a ""library of spirits"".

Upon arrival with another executive, we were told that at 11:45 PM (the bar was already closed). That was disappointing but but tolerable. We braved the cold night and found drinks and food elsewhere. Upon entering my room, I was surprised at how SMALL the room is. My bathroom at home is bigger. Since, I am only staying for 3 nights -- I figured no big deal. Linens and pillows had the distinct smell of OLD, SWEATY BODY ODOR, so much so that I had to spray perfume on them nightly and sleep on one of my clean shirts so as to not have to smell or have my face touch the pillow directly. Even that, I tolerated b/c as a seasoned traveler I have learned that if a hotel has smelly linens in the room -- the ones they will replace won't be much better. All these small things don't amount to much individually but all together is annoying and irritating BUT STILL I tolerated it and did not say anything to hotel staff. HOWEVER, if there should be one redeeming factor let it be the hotel staff service and room service. And there too hotel staff failed miserably. After a very long day, I ordered a $16 burger (after service fee, tip etc. total was more like $32 -- seriously.) only to have it come ALL wrong. After advising hotel staff they told me they were ""willing"" to comp me a new burger. Shouldn't they be apologetic and I be the one ""willing"" to accept it? When I asked if they could duplicate my order and asked her to read it back to me (it must have been initially written down, right?) I was put on eternal hold. I went out crossed the street and bought a burrito faster than they were able to figure out if they wrote it down or not, still don't know -- pretty sure not) Room service shouldn't be this hard, listen and write it down. Also don't tell me you are ""willing"" to do anything after you have messed up. Apologize profusely and ask if I'd be willing to accept the comped meal (I wouldn't have anyway). Mediocre at best and overpriced to boot.","Miami, Florida","JAX0425</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",0,2.0

What an ideal location for those of us that want to be far away from the annoying tourists of Time Square but close to everything! Situated a block from the Union Square Subway, you can go to all the important places in the city without switching trains. We were in Battery Park (Statue of Liberty) and the Freedom Tower in minutes. Another stop was close to Central Park and the Broadway area. Forget the subway as several wonderful areas are within walking distance of the hotel. This was truly an ideal location for me. Stay in Times Square if you must but I was so happy to be far away from it.Check-in was fantastic and Kenza was a delight throughout the trip. She was friendly, enthusiastic, and had some great food recommendations. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and accommodating. We stayed in an ADA accessible room which overlooked the street. I believe this was an upgrade over the courtyard view I booked. It was spacious and the ADA accessible items were not intrusive with the exception of the shower which resulted in a wet floor everytime someone took a shower. The room is thoroughly modern, stylish, upscale, comfortable, and had awesome touches such as a Bluetooth enabled clock and plenty of plugs in the room. My only complaints were the lack of a fridge (which could have fit in the room) along with a vanity mirror with a broken light (it was hard to see in the mirrors). Otherwise, I loved the room! There were some elevator issues in the hotel a couple of times but they were not overly annoying.I would be sad if I didn't stay here on my next trip to New York.

The front desk staff were nice and professional. They assigned us a high floor view room which I appreciated. Then we discovered the facilities/maintenance manager is doing such a POOOOOOR job. The first room had a bathroom ceiling that vibrated so loud from the HVAC unit. It was like being near a helicopter and was louder than any super 8 hotel! I could have never slept! We asked to move rooms and were told someone would come up to help us move. A guy came by, fairly quickly, and gave me a key yet had no luggage cart and clearly didn't want to help us. We managed.We moved to the 2nd room, which had a terrace. Nice! Yet the terrace door didn't lock- the lock wouldn't turn. That gives our neighbors fairly easy access to my room. The HVAC unit in this room was loud too, even though nothing like the 1st room. We slept in a cold room the 1st night due to the noise, and I actually heard the unit in the room next door. It got worse: The toilet was in its own room which flooded from the shower above us. It was easy to see the water damage in the ceiling and down the wet walls. Also the sink barely drained leaving a pool of yuk. I used the business center which turned out to be a single computer w/no chair in an employee hallway. It was uncomfortable and freezing (winter) being near a service corridor w/the door opened exposing trash and related.The TV worked when pulled away from the wall yet often lost signal when it was pushed back in- bad connections. Finally the billfold with a writing pad had no paper in it so why bother to have one?I've stayed in a A LOT of Hyatt hotels over the past 30 years. Compared to other Hyatts, the maintenance here stinks. Between the small rooms and all the problems, I'd rate this as a 3 star hotel- certainly not 4 stars.","denver, co","denverroadtrip</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>denver, co</strong>",160,3.0

The hotel was in a great location, was well decorated, had courteous staff and had everything you would want from such a hotel. I would have given this hotel a 5 rating until we checked out. That said, I must tell you to be VERY aware of their billing tactics. We had reserved one room with two queen beds but upon checking in, the front desk person informed us they no longer had a room with two queen beds available but, ""for the same price, we will give you two king rooms that adjoin."" I thought, ""PERFECT."" We enjoyed our stay and after check out I realized they charged us for both rooms (my mom checked us out and didn't thoroughly review the bill. Admittedly, she is not a seasoned traveler so she trusted their billing, signed the bill and left). Once I realized the mistake (four hours later), I called and asked them to remove one room as that was not the agreed upon plan. They said, ""no problem! It is all taken care of."" So I followed up by asking how much we owed. The price they gave me took a couple hundred bucks off the bill. Ummm, no...I need a whole room charge removed, not less than half a night. So, had I not asked, they would have gotten away with charging me more...again. They tried to pass it off by saying, ""we only agreed to giving you the same rate for one night."" I said, ""WHAT?!??"" I can assure you, that was NOT the case. I responded that I was only going to pay for one room. They proceeded to do some interesting math and started using industry phrases that I am sure they were using to try and confuse me and told me I owed more than the one room total. I am not sure how that even made sense considering I had two bills, one for the first room, and one for the second. It a seems to me, I should only pay for one of those rooms. At one point they said, ""that room charge was a mistake on our part, we should have charged you more."" CHARGED US MORE?!?? You charged me for two rooms when you told me you would only charge me for one and almost got away with it, and then tried to charge me more AGAIN and hang up the phone before I could question it. I finally gave in and agreed to pay the higher price for the one room (I was at the airport dealing with a flight cancellation and was about to be helped after waiting a long time in line to speak with an airline customer service agent...I had no choice but to give in) and THEN the manager started to add our ""incidentals,"" on from the other room which were a few food items and drinks from the mini bar. I stopped him and asked him why after messing up our bill and me finally agreeing to pay the higher price for the one room (and losing 30 minutes of my life dealing with this situation) that he would even bother. The manager Stephen did agree to remove the mini bar charges. That was the only positive that came out of our conversation, but let's not forget they still got more money out of me than they should have and would have gotten a lot more had I not reviewed the bill or followed up with their first, ""all taken care of."" So, stay here for a good and reliable branded hotel with a good location, but be aware that they will take advantage of you and use any tactic they can to charge you extra. I should add, one elevator was broken so it took us about 20 minutes to get up or down every time we needed it. That was quite annoying but not a deal breaker. Their tactics and willingness to over bill you were most alarming and, to me, a deal breaker.",Shanghai,"NikNakMcHen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai</strong>",15,2.0

Without hesitancy I choose the Hyatt Union Square, specifically the Alcove Loft junior suite. Because it's a wrap around shaped room it feels so spacious and the bathroom has a separate door for the toilet, and a fantastic large shower. The bed is exceptional. Details are thought of in this simply designed room! I love that you can open a window for fresh air, and the room has three massive windows, so light! I also wanted a hotel where we could walk in and out without traversing a mammoth lobby to get to elevators, the Hyatt is exactly that- large lobby, but designed not to make the hotel guest walk through the whole thing!

Otherwise, the room was comfy, wi-fi worked well, and I felt the rooms were surprisingly quiet for a city hotel - street noise didn't seem that bad.Service: The front desk was friendly, and room service was good. The only issue I had was some of the front staff had no clue about the local area. I asked about a local happy hour and the first person passed me to the next, who directed me to the hotel bar (pretty sure I could find that myself), and the bartender informed us there was no HH. Ugh. BTW, we found a good one a block over on 3rd Ave (Linen Hall), I will stay that George stood in stark contrast to the early team.

The room, for a New York hotel room was quite spacious and well appointed. The furniture was very interesting, the location of the refrigerator was very clever and I really liked that the light inside of the closet came on when the closet door opened. It rained while we were there and a nice touch in the room was the presence of an umbrella, rather than having to ask to borrow an umbrella or go out and buy one in the rain.

I landed on the Hyatt at Union Square because of its relative affordability and its ideal location. Most of the hotels in Manhattan carry a high price tag, but where the Hyatt excels is its ability to provide a comfortable and hassle free stay for less than the price of other surrounding hotels.We arrived in NYC early morning and to our surprise, the hotel was able to check us in at 9am, which greatly improved our weekend vacation. Upon arrival, check in was easy and the front desk made sure to provide anything that we requested. Union Square proved to be a great place to stay in because of it's central location in Manhattan, which made it easy to get to any corner of the city, whether by walking, subway, or taxi (or in our case, Uber). The room was small but made up for its size with the amenities it provided and the large bathroom and shower.The service at the hotel was 5-star, except for one small hiccup I had concerning the complimentary shoe shine service, wherein employee never showed up to polish my shoes at my request. Other than that, our entire stay was smooth, comfortable and genuinely pleasant.If you would like to stay in Manhattan for a decent price while not having to compromise on creature comforts, the Hyatt at Union Square will meet your needs and leave you satisfied.","Cabazon, California","I5722QYjohnn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cabazon, California</strong>",0,4.0

I started staying there because it was the closest to my office, but after trying out other nearby hotels, I find myself returning time after time to the Hyatt. My favorite things: good balance in the lobby (easy to hang out and wait if needed, but not overdone or too large to navigate), fast elevators, super comfy beds, AMAZING blackout curtains (I've overslept more times than I can count - I now rely on the wake up calls!), a decent selection of snacks in the room, good room service (the homemade donuts are the best), good restaurant/bar right in the hotel, and very helpful staff. All of these make for a generally great experience every time I have stayed here. Just a few things could use improvement: I was initially booking through a 3rd party website and so even though I was staying at least a few times per month, the front desk staff wouldn't recognize me and would give me the entire new guest spiel each time. At one point I think I even said, ""Seriously? I was here last week."" to the person at the check in counter who asked if I had stayed with them before. She had checked me in at least 2-3 times prior. If I'm staying this often at your hotel, I'd like to think you'd treat me like I'm coming home to somewhere familiar, even if booking through a 3rd party. Perhaps it's a technique to convince frequent guests to use their proprietary rewards system? Also, many rooms (mostly the courtyard-facing ones) don't have a minibar fridge, which is frustrating when you'd like a cold drink without ordering room service or heading outside. Finally, every single time I stay, I request foam pillows instead of the feather ones. You'd think that the front desk would note this and have them automatically placed in my room upon my arrival. Just a few improvements would make this hotel spectacular, and I would be extremely hard to convince to stay anywhere else in the City!","Rochester, New Hampshire","Rachel S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New Hampshire</strong>",0,5.0

First three nights were for business, the next five were for 'pleasure'. The business portion of the stay was great. I was given a room without a refrigerator and was provided one quickly when I requested one. I needed additional hangers and those too were provided without issue. Hyatt provides in room coffee and I was provided two packages of regular coffee each day. All was good. Then came the personal part of my stay. One night I was awoken in the wee hours of the morning by what sounded like a dog scratching on the door and a VERY STRONG smell of lacquer. When leaving my room the next day, I could tell that the baseboards in the hallway had been worked on and also had appeared to have been painted. In the middle of the night, really? On the second day of my personal stay, we were provided no regular coffee, when we called to inquire we were told that they had run out but that coffee would be provided in the lobby the next morning from 5 am to 7 or 8 am I believe. When we went to the lobby for coffee, we were told that wasn't offered on the weekends. We then had no option but to buy from their restaurant or go to a local coffee shop. Before heading back to our room that evening we checked on the coffee. We were told they only had decaf. For the remainder of our stay the regular coffee was not replenished. How does an organization as large as Hyatt run out of regular coffee? Another day we returned to our room in the early evening after a day of sightseeing to find our room had not been made up. Another day we were provided no hand towels. On our final day we attempted to use the computer in their lobby to print our boarding passes only to find out the computer had a software issue and we couldn't access the airline's site. I can't complain about the front desk staff as they were all friendly, helpful, professional and courteous. But I'm perplexed as to what happened halfway through our stay.

I typically stay at the Park Hyatt (which is amazing) or one of the many great boutique hotels in NYC. However, I was met with disappointment after disappointment. When I checked in I was notified that there was an upgrade available but that they may have to move me later during my stay. I graciously accepted the upgrade and was promptly relocated the next day. However, when checking online the room type I was upgraded to still available. When I asked about why I was moved when the room type was still available I was met with a blank stare followed by ""You are right, I don't know why the moved you. But they moved you already so I can't do anything now."" The Diamond benefits letter was delivered the following day since nothing was explained at check in. The Diamond breakfast benefit is a $25 credit at the restaurant in the lobby. The service in the restaurant is good, but the food is just alright and over priced (i.e. a side of mixed berries is $14).

This property considers their corner room a suite - I think they call it the Alcove loft, which is a huge joke, so when you use your diamond suite upgrades this is what you are going to be getting. I cannot imagine what a basic room is going to be like.2. They don't have a proper breakfast buffet, which poses a problem especially if you are a diamond member. Although they did attempt to fix the problem by crediting me fully, I still think that they should fix their breakfast offerings instead. Have a different menu for diamond members. They were offering a $25 per person credit which is a joke if you look at their prices. When I have breakfast included, I expect a buffet, if you do not have a buffet like at some Park Hyatt properties then I expect to be able to order whatever I like on the ala carte menu. I am not an unreasonable person, for 2 people this is what we ordered to share: minute steak with eggs, french toast, juice and one other item most likely. So we basically had a bit of meat, eggs, carbs/pastry with the french toast... and juice which is what you would typically get in a buffet. And this with tip comes up to a whopping 80-100 bucks. I had breakfast there, 2 or 3 times and that was what the bill was, the hotel wanted to cover something like $60-$70 bucks I was adamant that my order would constitute what a normal breakfast would be. And that should not be $80-$100. I just hate having to haggle. 3. If you have matte tile floors in the toilet that needs special care and be wet mopped, that did not happen during my stay. Bear in mind that whenever I ask for my room to be cleaned I tip the usual $5. So I expect my room to be cleaned properly.Overall the experience was ok, it was not horrible but it was surely average. The room was tiny even after the upgrade. If I was going to be paying $300-$400 for the room I would surely be staying some where else. Also this hotel has little to no facilities. I must say the servers at their breakfast place was above average.","Toronto, Canada","jdanielca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",33,3.0

We took a terrace room and while the terrace is cool, relatively spacious and furnished, I would not come back and pay the price I did just to have the terrace. I believe the regular rooms are just as small as the terrace room and cheaper. Overall I think this is a good choice for the city with a few quirks which when fixed can make this a great hotel.

I assumed it was a problem just with my room, but a colleague staying at the hotel told me that the same thing had happened to him.

Decor is nice and modern and the bed was very comfortable. Most importantly, the room was clean and in a good condition.

I have had a great experience each time. The hotel is in a modern style, with friendly and helpful staff. I stayed in an Alcove Loft, which is roomy (for New York) corner room, light and airy and has great views out of windows on two sides. It has a little sitting area, a desk, 2 TVs and and very comfortable bed. In terms of amenities, the hotel has a very nice gym, beautiful roof deck (which they don't promote--I'm not sure why because it is great on a summer evening), a nice bar and good restaurant next door. The one bad experience I had was getting stuck in the elevator but someone answered the call button right away and I was out of there in about 10 minutes. Last but not least, the last time I was there I forgot some clothes and they located them and shipped them right to me. Kudos to the honesty and responsiveness of the housekeeping staff! (As an aside, I've never recovered anything I have left at a hotel in the past). I will definitely stay there again when visiting family in the area.","La Jolla, CA","kcamow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla, CA</strong>",3,5.0

By that time, they should have made that night free. And for half of our 7 day trip, one of the two elevators was not working so it took 10 minutes to catch one. This was a pain and completely inconvenient. Also, the room was TINY!! There was nowhere to put our luggage because the beds did not have space underneath them. Then once we had unpacked there was barely any closet or drawer space to put our clothes. Now mind you it was me and my mother (two women) so we brought A LOT of clothes especially since we were staying there for 7 nights!Oh and another thing was the fact that you could hear someone talking in the lobby all the way up to the 10th floor.

Really liked the Union Square location as it was easy to get to/from wherever we were going. Hotel room was pretty small compared to other rooms I've stayed in (outside of NYC), but I think that's common in NYC. Bed was very comfortable and the shower was hot and had sufficient water pressure which were both important things after exploring the city each day. I would stay there again.Only cons was the Hyatt Passport rewards benefits don't go very far here (free wi-fi and late check-out only...not even a complimentary water which we typically get at other Hyatts). Rooms also had thin walls (could hear the people in the hallway clearly and the woman next to us coughing all night). Not enough drawer space for our things/luggage so we had to be creative as well with the tight space. Also, no view outside the window (we looked into a tiny courtyard and back of another building).

I am a Diamond member and often stay in midtown, and all Hyatts have been very good, but this one is in a different class as it's much more of an Andaz feel, and every interaction I had was surprisingly excellent. From the maids, to the front desk, to the guys who took shoes for complimentary shines, every employee either loves working here, or they have been incredibly well trained. I upgraded to an Alcove Suite, which was a superb suite. The bed was excellent, the shower outstanding, and the layout was very cool as I had multiple street views. Great Nespresso in the room (dangerous for them as they give you small cups, so if you pick the wrong size it could overflow). Very good closet design, safe; excellent, clean work out facility, very cool lobby, even nice elevators. Staff was uniformly superb. My only complaint would be that Diamonds, who usually get free breakfasts, were given a $25 credit instead, and you know what that buys you in NYC...A fantastic hotel, located in a great area with access to subways that take you pretty much anywhere.
