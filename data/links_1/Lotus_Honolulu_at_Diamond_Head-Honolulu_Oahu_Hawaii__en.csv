If you can score a corner room facing Diamondhead it is one of the best views in town—ocean to city with Kapiolani Park and Diamondhead right off your balcony. If you enjoy birding, the balcony is a great place to spot the birds of the park. The service is really great. They take the time to know your preferences and accommodate you. Plus, the lobby coffee is delicious (not that weak watery stuff so many hotels serve up).

The staff was all very helpful and pleasant. The location is off the main strip so it is a bit more quiet, which we very much enjoyed. It is walking distance from the heart of Waikiki Beach, we walked to and from numerous times a day. There is immediate beach access too. There is an onsite restaurant with a wine down (that means free wine!). They also offer free ocean safe sunscreen which came in great packages that fit in a purse or bag easily. You can sign out beach chairs, blankets, umbrellas and I think even coolers. It was a great perk. There is valet parking at no extra charge.

We really enjoyed being within walking distance to the main Waikiki Beach, but removed from the craziness. Would have loved to have a pool and gym, but the beach next door was beautiful and always much calmer/less windy than any other beaches we went to and made up for it. And jogging around the park across the street made up for missing the gym. The lobby/elevator/hallways could use some updating but the rooms and the restaurant were great. We only had happy hour snacks and drinks at the restaurant but everything we had was delicious. Really enjoyed having a balcony in our room, even though it was mostly a view of a parking lot we could still look out at Diamond Head and enjoyed the nice breeze.

I prefer to not go into Waikiki at all, but the Diamond Head location of the Lotus makes staying in town more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the location is really the best thing that the Lotus has going for it.The good: - The Lotus is clean and the staff is friendly. - The hotel is small and you never feel like you're swimming in a sea of tourists which is something I really look for. - They have beach chairs and mats you can borrow.- Close to the less-crowded Sans Souci beach and walking distance to everything Waikiki has to offer.Things you should know: - Parking is included in the daily ""amenities fee"" ($29 at the time I wrote this).- The term ""ocean view"" is used liberally by the Lotus. We spent extra for the Premium room and you could definitely see the ocean, but only through the gaps of the much larger buildings that are between the Lotus and the beach. - When I book a room for 3 people, I expect for there to be a place for each person to sleep. We had one king bed and when they brought in the roll-away the room felt cramped and we had to climb over it to get to the lanai. Rooms are small.- The bar/restaurant is nice but it's dark and modern. If you want that island vibe, you need to go over to the beachfront New Otani next door. Conclusion: I didn't really feel like the Lotus was a good value and even though we really try to make the best of things and not be big complainers, there were things about it that were constantly making us feel disappointed. Honestly, I feel like the property is misrepresented in the marketing and on the website.

Deciding where to stay in or near Waikiki was more challenging than expected. After studying maps and reading tons of reviews and screening targeted hotel ads we chose The Lotus. It was perfection. The location on the far edge of Waikiki next to the park and at the base of Diamond Head was lovely. We could walk bike or Lyft to restaurants easily. The park setting looking over trees and a quiet boulevard removed us from the chaos of the crowded concrete jungle of central Waikiki hotel zone. We walked the park morning and evening. Discovered the community gardens there and met some wonderful people. Lotus is a smaller boutique property that was just right sized and their customer service was personal. Valet parking (free) was an unexpected bonus. Their valets are smart warm and personable and efficient. Because it is smaller there was no wait time for our car. Our partial ocean view king room on the sixth floor faced both Diamond Head and the park to the left and viewed the ocean toward the right. Not a full ocean view but we could see waves. Best part is that the lanai (balcony) was never in full sun. A welcome respite from 7 days of full sun on the Big Island. The rooms are updated beautifully spacious and well appointed. The wall of glass on the lanai were actually two huge glass doors that opened wide. Instead of drapes which can be messy to open there are rolling white shutter doors for privacy and light control. So pretty. The closet was huge. The fridge and microwave were in a big cabinet that enabled us to tuck away our light food stash out of sight. The bathroom was gorgeous with large counter and an extra shelving unit on which we could lay out our personal care items I’ve never seen so much usable bathroom shelf space in a hotel. They provided a complimentary reusable travel water bottle and sunscreen This hotel was quiet because it doesn’t have a million rooms. They provide coffee and tea service in the morning in the lobby which was perfect. We didn’t need a free breakfast buffet and it’s chaos. We bought cereal and yogurt at the nearby convenience store and enjoyed breakfast and coffee on our lanai before heading out each morning. If we wanted a big breakfast restaurants were easily walkable nearby. They provide beach chairs mats towels and bikes to use daily. The semi private beach is just a few steps away through the parking lot. We had an issue with the air conditioning and their technician reset it within 5 minutes of the call. Amazing attention.  Our reservation included a car rental (bonus) since I booked direct with the hotel. It saved us quite a bit and we got a great room at a great price. It is a beautiful classy and wonderful hotel. I recommend it for guests seeking a quiet retreat. I will book here again on future trips to Honolulu.,Cleveland Ohio,"Jack-MK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland Ohio</strong>",60,5.0

First the bad: second night we were enjoying our balcony when we smelled cigar smoke. The smell was very strong and unpleasant. I called the front desk and they said they would do their best to locate it. We went in and closed our doors to avoid it. Next morning, sitting on our balcony having coffee, the smell of cigarettes came our way. Again very strong and unpleasant. I looked over the rail, and directly to our left there were 2 men, one with a cigarette. I said ""excuse me, but this is a no smoking property, even on the balcony"" The smoker took a puff and blew it my way. I said "" Seriously? I will have to call the front desk if you do not put that out."" Both men began verbally abusing us, calling us ""trash Americans"", one guy turning his butt to us and patting it saying ""here, this is for you"" I called the front desk. I went back out and one of the men was telling my almost 70 year old husband that he was going to ""come see"" my husband. We went downstairs and talked to Sarah, the front desk person. She said they said ""sorry"", and they would follow the policy. They were given a warning, but not fined the $450 charge for violating the rule. We said we wanted them moved, because we did not feel comfortable being right next to people who boldly verbally abused us and tried to intimidate us. She said she could not move them because the only open room would have been a downgrade. When I signed the contract it was VERY clear that there was to be no smoking. These customers spoke great English; I am sure they signed the same contract. It does not seem right that they were allowed to abuse other customers, violate rules they agreed to, and they have no consequence. The manager chose to offer us the only other available room- the penthouse suite for our last night. We accepted, though packing up and moving was a hassle. The penthouse is HUGE - way too big for 2, but has a fabulous view. We actually prefered our first room. It was very comfortable and had a very nice view. All staff were friendly, and other than the abusive smokers, we thought the hotel was great. The valet parking was so convenient, with super friendly and helpful attendants. Obviously this property will continue to have people violate their no- smoking policy if they don't actually enforce it.

The hotel itself is extremely nice, clean and has a very friendly staff. We had a premium room which had a view over the park, walkway, partial ocean view and over the top of a garage (which was beautifully landscaped). Birds visited our balcony daily. It was wonderful to sit out on the balcony in the early a.m. and p.m. If you visit and stay here, please get a premium room or you may be disappointed as the other rooms overlook parking lots. Our room was beautiful!I am rating this hotel with 4 stars and not 5 stars because when we stayed here the restaurant was closed. The Lotus is under new management and they are updating the restaurant. This would not usually be a problem; however, the Lotus is located on the other end of Waikiki and it is a half mile walk down the walkway to restaurants and shops and then another half mile back to the hotel. There are only two (expensive) restaurants located nearby the Lotus: Michel's At the Colony Surf (fine dining dinner only) next door and The Hau Tree Lanai across the parking lot. We suggest that if you book this hotel and don't have access to the hotel's restaurant, you may want to use TheBus service which is available very close to the Lotus and drops off throughout Waikiki. On nice days or in the a.m., the walkway is wonderful for exercise or just enjoying the views up the ocean coast or park. The Lotus is a boutique hotel and has a lot of nice services offered: wine in the late afternoon, turn down service, daily cleaning and boutique quality soaps, shower gels, hair shampoos and conditioners, slippers, and robes. A very nice, quiet hotel that is nearby the beach and walkway to everything Waikiki has to offer. The Lotus does not have a pool but the beach is very close by.

We started our trip at the Lotus Honolulu for three nights and had an overall good experience. The ocean view premium room we booked was worth the upgrade, as the room was very spacious and offered an amazing view of Diamond Head. However, there are two buildings between this hotel and the beach, so there was no direct beach view and beach access was through a (somewhat difficult to find) walkway that led out to a small beach area in front of a restaurant (no privacy). You are much better off walking out of the front of the hotel to the sidewalk and to your left around a few buildings to a larger and nicer beach area. Parking was valet only and the valets were very friendly and helpful with all our questions. One of my favorite surprises about this hotel was Wisp Restaurant, really amazing food and happy hour specials but unfortunately it sounds like it is no longer open. AVOID THE COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM, it had stagnant water in the tank that gave me a rather bad stomach ache the first morning. Instead, in the lobby area there is good coffee served in the morning and a free wine reception in the evening.

My mother and I return to Honolulu after scoring those coveted $100 roundtrip flights on Southwest from Oakland. I called up Lotus Honolulu because we were definitely going to stay there again. The only thing that gave us pause was that the Lotus was under new management as of January 2019. Since we so thoroughly enjoyed our first stay, we were concerned that the Lotus that we came to know and love would drastically change while under new management.The rooms are well appointed with either a king or two queen-sized beds, flat screen TV, wet bar with mini refrigerator and microwave. They were also balconies that offered picturesque views of Waikiki and Diamond Head. Thankfully our fears were not well founded. We actually fell in love with Lotus all over again and truly came to appreciate the sense of Ohana (family) as expressed from Travis, JR, Dev, Carissa, Sarah just to name a few. You cannot get a better value than the Lotus Honolulu in the Waikiki / Diamond Head area. The resort fee is quite reasonable and huge shock it includes complimentary warm valet parking from the likes of Travis and Dev! The daily resort fee covers the beach towels, beach chairs, and free bicycle rentals.The front desk staff (JR, Carissa, and Sarah) were always courteous and helpful, from making sure that we were comfortable in our rooms, ensuring that we could enjoy the complimentary coffee in the morning as well as the wine happy hour in the evening. They were always glad to assist us in finding the best bars and restaurants on the island.Daily Happy hour between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm with red and white wine with bar snacks (like popcorn, pretzels, etc.)Daily Hawaiian coffee and tea in the lobby from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm.My mother and I had an amazing 9-day /8-night stay at the Lotus and had a difficult time saying goodbye and eagerly await returning to this special place.","San Francisco, California","rilliwilli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,5.0

In the past when we visited Oahu we always stayed in one of the large hotels on the main strip of Waikiki. The Lotus is about 1/2 mile off the Waikiki strip and away from the noise and congestion. We loved the calm and quiet of the Lotus. It's a smaller, high-rise hotel. The hotel is a little older, but our room was remodeled with nice furniture and very clean. Valet parking is included in the resort fee and is very convenient. Since the Lotus is so small it never took the valet more than 30 seconds to retrieve our car. The resort fee also includes use of beach towels, beach chairs, bikes and yoga mats. The staff is helpful and courteous. The only downside is that the hotel does not have a restaurant or pool. We didn't mind because the room has a small refrigerator/microwave in the room along, coffee/tea in the lobby and the beach is very close. Eating places are a short walk from the hotel. My wife and I will be going back to Oahu next yearend definitely plan on staying at the Lotus again.","Orange County,CA","Jeffrey S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County,CA</strong>",15,5.0

It’s nothing much to look at from the street or even from the outside corridors to the rooms. But once you enter, you will find a lovely, cosy and spacious haven which is very clean, bright and comfortable. This hotel is all about attention to detail and attention to the guests’ comfort and needs. Management gave us gifts of a very useful water bottle, and a lockable beach bag for valuables. Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided each morning, and free espresso is also available in the room. At happy hour free wine is offered although my wife and I did not partake as we are non drinkers. We did make use of the free bikes with locks to go up to Waikiki for lunch. Since this is a very small hotel there is no pool or gym but two minutes away is a very secluded and beautiful beach good for swimming and snorkelling. Make sure you spend some time here as I think it is much more pleasant than the very congested Waikiki Beach. If you enjoy running, there is an amazing two mile loop around the park next to the hotel which attracts all sorts of runners. And if the weather is good the slow, long walk to Diamond Head is definitely worth it. The resort fee of 29$ is cheap for Honolulu and this fee includes free valet parking and phone calls. We had a car and we believe this will make your plans more flexible and convenient and your overall vacation much more enjoyable, especially since the Lotus is NOT close to the restaurants on the Waikiki strip, about half hour walk away or more. All in all this hotel is an amazing find for expensive Honolulu! I booked my room at a very reasonable price as they offer promotions all the time. I highly recommend the Lotus.

No breakfast, no uninterrupted view of the ocean despite us paying top category for an ocean room. Be prepared to primarily view the building in front blocking all ambiance.

We arrived very late due to flight delays and we were greeted by a gentleman who surprised us with a room upgrade. Our view from the 11th floor was simply spectacular- an ocean view from one lanai and an unobstructed view of diamond head from the other lanai. The room was everything we could’ve asked for. It was meticulous! I couldn’t believe how clean it was. The bed was very comfortable and I love it when the hotel provides slippers and robes. There was a mini fridge and microwave as well. Loved how environmentally-friendly this hotel was by providing a reuseable water container which can be filled with the water dispenser downstairs; reef-safe sunscreen was also provided for our snorkeling trips. I loved how I got great value out of the $25 daily resort fee which included valet parking, wifi, use of beach chairs and beach towels, coffee, tea and the newspaper each morning. As a frequent traveler the one thing that stood out to me was the friendliness of all the staff- by far the friendliest staff I’ve ever encountered at any hotel. Everyone genuinely seemed like they were happy to be there. The one area for improvement that I could identify was the hotel’s restaurant. We checked it out one night for dinner. The food was mediocre and the music was much too loud- I felt bad for those staying on the 3rd floor as they surely could hear the music throughout the night.

The complimentary coffee/tea, etc in the lobby in the morning, and the great happy hour with nice wines, nibbles and lovely musicians each evening were delightful.

It was nice, the view from our balcony was OK. We saw a glimpse of the beach to the right, and a park with Diamond Head looming beyond it. Most of our view was of parking lots and other hotels. But it was still OK. The room was adequate. Service was very good, especially the Valet service. Good coffee every morning in the lobby, wine every evening. Always free. The hotel restaurant is pricey. Better to go out. The location is nice if you like to be away from the crowds. Just over half a mile walk to Waikiki Beach. Beach to the left, park to the right.

Actually a very nice quiet location with Kapi’olani regional park on one side, offering an outstanding view of Diamond head hill. The other side is Kaimana beach, really clean public beach that is not congested compared to main strip. Clear water & fish with a convenient store close by & some ocean front dining. Lotus is just behind it. From the airport it takes about 30 minutes & costs about $18 using shared Speedishuttle.The main strip such as Waikiki Shopping plaza is about 25 min walk and enroute on the same road is Honolulu Zoo & Waikiki aquarium. It’s basically close enough to the main area but quieter & more relaxing. RoomThe ocean view room on the 8th floor was really spacious, clean with boutique decor. Large comfortable king size bed faces good size TV that offers castnow & also there is a PlayStation on offer. Decent glass top desk & arm chair with foot stool. The room also offers an alarm clock, microwave, small fridge, illy espresso machine, ironing board, luggage rack & a huge safe with plenty of storage space. The bathroom was also large with a shower cubicle & foot bath, great for removing sand. Full set of mini bottle amenities from Awapuhi / Paul Mitchell. The highlight of the room however is the large ocean view balcony, though it is a side view with mainly a car park & the main park, one can see the waves between building. Two chairs & offered with both glass & black out wooden sliding doors. Overall a very nice room with modern lamps, nice rug & wooden flooring. Beach boutique done in a pleasant way that had no marks or overuse. There is also digital AC controls & cordless phone. It would be hard pressed to find the same standard of room in the big chains for the price charged. Facilities The hotel offers free secure WiFi with room credentials. There is no pool at this hotel & this only weakness, however the sea & beach is very close. There is also a restaurant & lounge bar that offers breakfast of which had to leave too early to try but also has happy hour with dinner daily from 4pm. They mentioned that they also present jazz, comedy, dance music different on every night. Parking at the hotel is not free but they do have space for valet during day at only $5 otherwise metered is outside. However they do offer complimentary bicycles to use to cycle about. ATM is also in lobbyIn the lobby is additional coffee & water machine and in room they provide a free branded water flask to use, instead of bottles of water in room. Like everywhere they do charge $25 resort fees. However one does get a free bottle of red wine & in addition around 5pm the reception area offers unlimited help yourself wine & small snacks. Plus expresso machine is also there & free. StaffStaff are mixed. Reception staff pleasant & friend. Valet staff that control bikes are ok but not very helpful with advice. Seem to want minimal dialogue.Overall a very nice boutique room in a quiet location but close enough to all the action. Would definitely stay here again.","London, England","doc d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",474,4.0

Given those previous pleasant stays, I booked two nights for a quick pleasure stopover on Oahu on my way to Hilo from San Jose. My first night there I had to go to the hospital for an emergency surgery and ended up waking up the next morning on a ventilator in the ICU at Queens hospital in Honolulu. I knew I was going to be in the hospital for at least two or three more days to recover. I knew no one to help me on the island, and I had my room booked for one more night with all my clothes there at the hotel and a rental car due back the next day that was parked at the valet service at the hotel. That first morning in the hospital I got an email from Ward Almeida, the manager of the Lotus Hotel. He had been informed by his staff of my having to go to the hospital and apparently made some calls and found out I would be in the hospital for a couple more days. The email he sent informed me he had returned the rental car for me and cancelled my reservation for the hotel room for that night so I wouldn't be charged for a stay while I was recovering in the hospital. He also offered to have all my belongings delivered to the hospital. I called him later that day after being taken off the ventilator. I thanked him for his excellent service and asked if he could please store my belongings until I was released from the hospital as my new plan was to book another night at the Lotus once I was discharged. On the morning I was discharged from the hospital, I made a reservation at the Lotus for that night using their website.. Soon after I made the reservation, I received another email from Ward stating he noticed I had made a reservation and that he had also noticed the price was higher than the room rate of my original reservation as it was made with such short notice. He informed me he would be sure I would be charged the original rate of my original booking. I returned to the hotel that day and all my belongings were nicely organized in my room. I also received a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates, and a welcome back card from Ward sent up to my room. I have travelled extensively and have never experienced that kind of above and beyond service at a hotel before. I am very grateful to have received such excellent service.

It also faces Diamond Head crater and is very close to some of the best neighborhood eats in the area (about 1.5 miles to Monserrat Avenue restaurants). I had a government discount (ask for it; though not as good as military discount) that waived the daily activity fees and parking! And parking is by valet which is so convenient and quick. Also, free access to beach towels, chairs, free coffee/tea and wine happy hour!We had a couple of minor issues that the management quickly resolved -- although they continued to have trouble with their electronic keys working when we left on 6/11.There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor, but it's not owned by the hotel and somewhat pricey. So we took our breakfasts at Bogart's on Monserrat Ave most days (get there early and expect to wait online -- worth it.) However, we did do ala carte breakfast on our last day at the restaurant and it was good (and convenient), despite being pricey. They also have laundry facilities, but the dryers were not great. Luckily the rooms are not humid and our stuff dried quickly being hung in the closet.We had a premium room with 2 queen beds (be sure to specify and confirm bed type) and 2 balconies -- one that had a view of Diamond Head mountain, the other of the ocean (partial). I recommend a room on the 8th floor or higher for the best views. It's a small boutique hotel and pretty quiet, another thing we loved. I marked it as ""luxury"" in my review as the rooms are listed as >$240/night + resort fee. Will definitely go back again the next time we are in Honolulu.

I had a feeling she is being personal, so I asked, and she admitted it. Right from the very beginning when we were checking in (it was April 5th) she was giving me an attitude while checking out other guests in more friendly way, those guests were the Americans. She was complaining that she has to do ""extra job"" by giving me a room with twin beds, although I have requested this during my booking. Is this something really that takes an effort? I did not request any upgrade, any special treatment, yet, she kept complaining that she is ""trying her best"", rolling her eyes, in order to give me a room with twin beds, which is obviously a difficult thing at the empty hotel.I didn't want to spoil my vacation and at the beginning I though that it only seems to me that way, but then my friend told me that this lady is being extremely rude. So I asked, why was she talking to me like that? And I couldn't believe what is literally said in a viscous way: ""Yes, I have hard time understanding you. Because you have an accent!""So this basically put a big ""no"" to this whole hotel and my experience with them. I simply do not tolerate rudeness and obviously this kind of place doesn't deserve any income from me.The hotel seems very old, more like for mature travelers, although the location is very good. There is no modern touch, smells like mold, even in the room that I was given to check if I like it, that had a wonderful parking view. It was a rainy day, we arrived at noon, she said the room will not be ready by 3pm, so I canceled my reservation and went to another hotel, which was amazing. I will not give my business to anyone with this attitude and I think those kind of actions should be strictly addressed with consequences. I would really like to receive some explanation from the management regarding this case. I hope that the management will not only provide polite reply, but actually will change their attitude and stop treating people badly. I also believe that people like her should not work in the hospitality industry. To all travelers: please never tolerate those kind of behaviors. You do not deserve to be treated this way in any hotel or anywhere else. Everyone has an accent, skin color and many other things, this is not a way to treat anyone, especially a guest.

The hotel met and exceeded all of our expectations. To give you an idea of how it is situated with the rest of the hotels on Waikiki Beach, it is about a 15 minute easy walk on the beach to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel . The hotel is located on Kapi'olani Park at the base of Diamond Head, so it is in a park like setting, with lots of trees and is removed from the mass of humanity that you find in the main areas of Waikiki Beach. But as I mentioned, it is a very easy and short walk to all of Waikiki Beach. So you have what I consider the best of both worlds.The hotel staff was excellent. It is a small boutique hotel, so the staff quickly learns your name. All very helpful, friendly and professional. There is a mandatory $25 resort fee, and for once, you really get what you pay for. Valet parking is included in the resort fee and your car is always parked within steps of the door, so it never takes them more than a couple minutes to retrieve your car. The hotel is not on the beach, but it might as well be on the beach. There is a very nice dedicated beach area that was a closer walk from our room than many hotels we have stayed in that are on the beach. The hotel has towels and beach chairs as part of the resort fee. Everything super easy and quick to check out.Our room was fantastic. Corner room on the 7th floor overlooking Diamond Head. Everything in the room was perfect. Great shower, big bathroom, great air conditioning, oversized safe, refrigerator and very fast internet.

Just minutes walking distance to the “main strip” and with a nice uncrowded beach right around the corner, this boutique 12 story hotel offers most of what larger hotels can offer. A big advantage is the quick and easy access to your car. Usually can just walk to your car just outside the entrance without having to wait for valet service - very convenient! Most rooms have partial ocean views and all have nice sized balconies.The rooms are modernly furnished with a relaxed and refined aesthetic, very comfortable. The bathrooms are spacious with lots of counter space and shelving for storage. Tips: There is a restaurant/nightclub on the 2nd floor which can get noisy on Friday and Saturday nights - so being higher up gets you away from the noise. You want a room on the 6th floor or above - definitely avoid the 3rd floor. Rooms that border the main street can also get some street noise, but many offer views of both Diamond Head and the ocean - so upper story rooms get you away from street noise as well.We are frequent guests of the Lotus and have always found the rooms to be clean and the staff friendly and helpful. During one stay, our shower drain clogged and the staff addressed it promptly - very responsive.","Walnut Creek, California","Puka1966</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walnut Creek, California</strong>",24,4.0

It’s a great location- on the beach (short walk in between buildings to the ocean), next to a beautiful park, ocean and Diamond Head views, but away from the crazy crowds of Waikiki. It’s a nice 20 min walk when we wanted to get to Waikiki, but we preferred staying close to the hotel in the peace.The hotel is small - only 5 rooms per floor - and the staff friendly. They have amenities like wine at happy hour, coffee and tea in the morning, beach gear, bikes, water bottles, etc. we took advantage of the 7:30am yoga and loved it!One day the elevator was not working for a few hours so we had to walk up 11 flights to our room. Not a big deal for us, but there is only one elevator so if something goes wrong you’ll need to adjust. This may be the very first time this ever happened but I wanted to mention it because it may be important to someone. It did not affect my rating in anyway.The lobby is very nicely decorated. The rooms are attractive and serene and we loved our view. There is a resort fee of $25 per day (not a choice) so be prepared for that. It includes parking and all the beach amenities I mentioned so I think it’s worth it, and the hotel is reasonably priced.I know I’ll recommend this hotel to friends and family which is the best indication of how I feel about it.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","avalonbride36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",58,5.0

The service was fabulous, very friendly valet and front desk staff. Immediate disappointment when arriving at our Diamond Head view room and finding that we really just overlooked an ugly parking lot and can barely see the top of Diamond Head (through the trees) only if standing right on our balcony and looking to the far left. There was no bath but the shower was a bit awkward and had almost a small bathtub base that pooled water in it. We were excited to stay off of the strip but were planning to rely on the shuttle to still get to Waikiki for meals and touring. Unfortunately the program the hotel advertises to track the shuttles (so you know when they will arrive) was not working so we never knew when they were coming/going. It made it very difficult to make plans without sitting in the lobby waiting 30 minutes for the shuttle. Very frustrating when it could have been a great system. The good things are that the hotel is peaceful, the bike borrowing option is nice as well as the beach chairs for the beach which is small but very close. The rooms were clean and spacious. Next time for the price I would pick another hotel closer to the strip or with a well operating shuttle.

It was close enough to the action, yet far away from all the hustle, bustle and noise Waikiki has to offer. Our room was on the 5th floor; we had a nice view of Diamond Head and a fairly decent view of the ocean.

Everyone was friendly, accommodating and helpful. We loved having the restaurant Wisp on site. We took advantage of having a nice breakfast and their happy hour specials. Again, great staff!The only item I was a little unsatisfied was because we purchased through Interval, we were only given one mid-week cleaning.

We had family nearby, so we didn’t have a car. We used the shuttle service to Waikiki a few times, but decided the beaches by the hotel were less crowded and we didn’t want to shop. We also had privileges through family members to the Outrigger Canoe Club, so we were in a perfect location to take advantage of all that had to offer. We took various side trips and all the tour buses were willing to pick us up at the Lotus, so we weren’t penalized for being out of the main Waikiki area.

A change from the over priced restaurants further down the beach. We particularly enjoyed using the hotel's tandem bike. It took a few minutes to get the hang of it but eventually got the rhythm and were about to enjoy a ride up and down Waikiki beach. All beaches are public but some are harder to access than others. So Lotus has their ""private"" beach a 100 yards down the path. Ask for beach chairs and snorkelling gear at the front desk. We were able to enjoy a corner suite with a full panoramic view of Diamond Head Park and a bit of the beach. Every morning we sat on the balcony and watched green, blue, yellow birds fly in and around the trees below. So magical.

It's much quieter than Waikiki and you have a feeling of living in a neighborhood (of beachside condo buildings) rather than a touristy area. The hotel has a wonderful small beach shared with a couple of the condo buildings and the Canoe Club. The resort fee includes beach chairs, mats, and towels, valet parking, wine-tasting every afternoon and yoga every morning, and since I take advantage of all of these, it's one place where I don't mind paying the fee. Rooms are large and pretty much identical, so there's not much fuss over which room to take. Higher floors have a slightly better view.The hotel is not for everyone, however. There are few restaurants and amenities in the immediate vicinity, so you can't just walk out your door to a large choice of restaurants, etc.. You will have to walk or bike .7 mile to the beginning of the main Waikiki area and then potentially further to arrive at your restaurant, store, club, take-out, or shopping. The hotel does provide a free shuttle bus into Waikiki and then into downtown Honolulu. Note also that there are three restaurants and one small convenient store within a few feet of the hotel. That said, IMHO the hotel works best with a car, Uber, or biking. The hotel provides free bikes that are quite nice and are well equipped with front and rear lights for riding at night. Also, the beach is small, private, and quiet and not a big scene with lots of bathers, volleyball, concerts, movies, vendors, etc. Just depends what you like.","Seattle, Washington","Richard W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",4,5.0

In a relative sense, that is true. It is located about a mile from the Waikiki ""strip,"" in an area mainly occupied by high-rise condos, across the road from Kapiolani Park in a pleasantly landscaped area.The decor adds to an impression of tranquility: a small lobby seating area with Asian furnishings and fresh orchids. No desks pushing tours, although I imagine the check-in personnel (helpful) can arrange what you are looking for if that's your goal. The guest bedroom we stayed in was on the small side though well appointed and cheerful.But The Lotus doesn't carry through its Zen-like vibe. The present management (which I suspect took the property over from the one that commissioned the design) seems to distrust the appeal of the quietness. In the public areas (including elevators) speakers play reggae and pop music.The Lotus's only restaurant -- and there are few others in the immediate neighborhood -- doubles as a sports bar and live music scene in the evenings. While the food is satisfying (we ate one dinner and every breakfast there) the multiple TV screens showing sports events and the bands shatter any pretensions to relaxation. The Lotus management seems to want to have it all ways for all people.On our second night when we went into the restaurant for dinner a bunch of oafs were setting up the sound equipment for the band and clowning around obnoxiously and loudly. We left and asked at the front desk for an alternative choice, and were directed to Miyako next door in the New Otani. It is very traditional Japanese, and if that suits you, you can be sure of an excellent experience at Miyako (try to get a table near the large window in the evening and watch the sunset). Meanwhile the Lotus's sports bar/restaurant offers, and I quote from their promotional material, ""entertainment nightly which varies between Jazz, Conemporary Hawaiian Dance Music, Rhythm and Blues, Comedy Shows and Special Movie Nights.""There is so much about the Lotus that is worthwhile, it's a shame management feels a need to go down-market and up-market at the same time, promoting a laid-back atmosphere and subverting it significantly.","Northern Virginia, Virginia","rdar2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern Virginia, Virginia</strong>",4,4.0

It is quiet, close to but not on the beach, has lovely rooms (spacious, nicely furnished, with comfortable beds and a good size shower rooms). The views of Diamond Head are good, but I would have been disappointed if I had particularly wanted a sea view since at best these are between other tower blocks. As far as I could tell, whatever floor you were on, you would be looking over a parking lot, although the higher the room, the less obvious this is.The hotel staff were without exception very pleasant. We requested a microwave oven at check-in, and the staff were already putting it in the room as we arrived. This was very handy, since many island activities start early and would require you to be out and about before breakfast is served. For example, sunrise at Diamond Head is popular; Pearl Harbor visitor center opens at 7 am, and you need to get there early if you like history but only have one day to spare.However, the Lotus Honolulu is not a resort hotel, the eating facilities are limited (and the restaurant was closed several nights of our stay for private functions), and there are not many other non-room-based facilities, which is fine if that is not important to you. We did have a rental car, and found the valet parking a minor nuisance (no fault of the staff, it just means having to remember to take everything from the car that will be required in the room). We were not tempted into eating places within walking distance.In summary, this is a really nice hotel if your main requirement is a good quiet room convenient for getting out and about, but if you are really into resort living, or lounging on a beach that's just outside your room, or very keen on nightlife or entertainment, or love to be waited on hand and foot, you will end up being disappointed. You have to work out some of these things by reading between the lines on the hotel's web-site, or studying TripAdvisor quite carefully, which in my opinion is a shame because it means someone who has not done their research might have unrealistic expectations. Having written that, we would very happily stay at the Lotus Honolulu again because it suited us very well.","Camberley, United Kingdom","Global803356</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camberley, United Kingdom</strong>",96,5.0

Zero customer service or attempt to rectify the problems! Over $200/night: ridiculous.Let me start by saying I’m local (just checked-out today...writing this immediately to warn others), so I am very familiar with other resort properties here. Comparatively, it deserves about a 5 or 6 max (out of 10; or, 3 out of 5), only if the cleanliness issues & malfunctions had NOT occurred. The property overall is noisy, outdated, and surrounded by parking lots (garbage - or other - trucks come through around sunrise & beep incessantly when backing out of the lot). Further, it is not an enclosed hotel; so, rather than an enclosed hallway insulating noise that echoes from the parking lots, every sound carries under the door & passes through thin walls...reverberating off of hard wood floors.When showering, the basin (like half of a hot tub at the bottom) filled with water rather than draining: disgusting. There were many large noticeable stains on the furniture. Also, the DVD player the front desk attendant talked-up when I checked-in (because the TV is terrible and offers only basic cable channels) is actually a PlayStation and did NOT work.I am out of space.

Your view of Diamond Head makes it seem like you can reach out and touch it! The blue Pacific is even closer. Take advantage of the hotel's yoga class held in Kapiolani Park which is just across the street. The attractions of Waikiki are a five minute stroll away--you won't need your car. The rooms are comfortably appointed with emphasis on the beautiful view past your lanai. The bathrooms are spacious and well designed both for function and aestheitics. I like that the floors are not carpeted but wood floors that look like the real thing but may be laminate. The housekeepers at Lotus do a marvelous job of keeping the rooms spotless! The lobby is very tastefully decorated. I really appreciated that it took less than one minute from the time I handed my car key to the valet to cross the lobby and enter the elevator to our room. It usually took longer than that because the friendly staff always had a smile and a recommendation for other fun activities--and then there's the complimentary wine in the afternoon. A very nice touch indeed! A true test of how well a hotel is managed is the morale of the the staff--do they like working there? I spoke with housekeepers, maintenance men and front desk staff. Not only do they say they like it, the proof is in how long they have worked here--unofficially, I would say an average exceeding ten years! And they don't fake the smiles! With all of the good things I have to say about the Lotus, I'd be remiss if I did not mention that it is a value when compared with other beachfront Waikiki properties.

There were 7 of us total staying at the Lotus, and they were able to book us all on the same floor, with our rooms next to each other, which was really nice and convenient. Unfortunately, when we arrived, the elevator had just stopped working, and we were on the 3rd floor. For most of us, this was just a minor inconvenience, but my mother-in-law suffers from painful arthritic knees, so that was not such a great start to our stay. However, the staff was wonderful and carried our luggage up the stairs and deposited it in one room so we didn't have to lug it up ourselves. Luckily, by the time we were ready to come down again after we were settled in, the elevator was working again, and all was smooth sailing after that. The rooms we had were on the side facing Diamond Head, and we each had a nice lanai outside our rooms with a small table and chairs so we could relax out there and look at the glorious view. You can't possible have a bad day when you wake up to a view of Diamond Head! Another fun bonus was the daily visits from the local colorful birds who were hanging around hoping for crumbs. There were so many different types, it was great just to watch them. My husband and I had the corner room, which also had views of the lovely park across the street. The room itself was very comfortable and spacious, clean and stylishly decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, which made it easier to fall asleep. The amenities were very nice, good quality coffee, and the local Hawaiian bottled water was provided and replenished every day, which was a huge plus for us. The bathroom was also roomy and very clean, with shelves to hold extra towels and room to place your accessories, which is usually a problem at most hotels. They also provide very nice Japanese cotton robes for your use during your stay, and even slippers, in case you forgot yours. I loved the provided toiletries so much that I ended up using them exclusively, instead of the ones I brought from home! The hotel also features a restaurant, Wisp, which we ate at multiple times during our stay, not only for convenience, but because the food was great, and the staff was very friendly and fun to chat with. I want to especially single out Will, who often waited on our table at breakfast, and provided us with a lot of tips about where to go and what to see, and how to get there. We got to know him a little during our stay, so much so that he almost felt like family by the time we left! Speaking of staff, everyone we dealt with was very friendly, helpful, and kind. No request was greeted as an imposition, and they seemed to genuinely care that we were comfortable and had anything we needed. What a unique experience! As others have mentioned, the location itself was perfect for a relaxing time. Peaceful surroundings, but you could easily walk to all the ""razzmatazz"" of Waikiki and enjoy the shopping and restaurants. The fact that it is also on the beach made it nice for walking in the area. The only minus, which I guess can't be helped: on the last morning of our stay, they had to kick everyone out of their rooms for a while so they could spray for bugs. A necessary evil, I suppose, since really, who wants bugs in the room? However, my mother-in-law didn't want to be exposed to the pesticide afterwards, so they accommodated her by waiting until after we were checked out to spray the room she'd been in, which was thoughtful and appreciated. Although we never took advantage of it, we saw many guests enjoying the wine happy hour in the lobby, and we did enjoy the lemon infused water whenever we returned from an outing. All in all, I found The Lotus to be a lovely place to stay, with personal service, and in fact would be my preferred choice to stay for future trips to Honolulu. I very highly recommend it for both honeymooners and families, as well as business travelers.","Los Angeles, California","Lina L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",5,5.0

We happened to stumble across it as it was a part of a package that came with flights and we decided to make it a part of our week long Honeymoon. What a great idea it was! One thing to note is that there is a resort fee but it is only $25! This resort fee covers complimentary delicious Aloha Wai waters each time you head out for your day, coffee service from 7am-10am, wine and snacks hours from 4-530pm (if I remember correctly), free valet parking, beach towels, beach chairs, umbrellas, and use of the bicycles which are very convenient as the close by Waikiki shops are a short pedal away. Also as other reviews mentioned there is no pool on property but who needs it when the beach is a short stroll away? It is more of a private beach as well so it wasn't as crowded as other areas, so that was wonderful.Upon checking in we were greeted by nothing but pure friendly service who truly cared about making your stay more pleasant and helping you out. They upgraded us to an ocean view and we had a perfect view of both the beautiful Diamond Head Crater and the ocean down below it truly seemed like straight from a postcard views. When we headed up to the room our luggage and stuff was already there and there was a bottle of sparkling wine with a personalized card waiting for us. The rooms also include a good size balcony where you can really take in the views. I also have to say that this is the first hotel where all the online pictures were very accurate to what we received. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was big with lots of shelving!

We left that awful accommodation almost immediately and search for more suitable living spaces. We happily stumbled upon the Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head on HotelTonight (excellent ratings). The Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head was willing to match and beat the price on HotelTonight and allowed us to book directly with them. Marcie, the front desk agent at the time of our arrival, was so sweet, kind and accommodating. She was the reason that we chose this property). We stayed in room 422 for our first night's stay, a room that featured two queen beds, marble bathroom, mini refrigerator and microwave (available upon request if not already in the unit). Rooms were spacious with a great mountain and ocean views from the balconyMuch to our surprise, we were upgraded upon request by the kindness and generosity of the hotel manager, Dean, the following morning to a higher unit on the corner (825) that featured two balconies (one oceanfront, the other mountain, and oceanview). Like Marcie ensured that we chose the Lotus the evening before, Dean ensured that we had no reason to look elsewhere and stay.... and stay we did!All the staff (valet {Travis, Dev and Yure}, maids, front desk personnel {Marcie, JR ""William""}, the hotel manager {Dean}, etc.) were extremely down-to-earth, kind, courteous and overall quite helpful. They were indispensable in helping erase the initial terrible experience we had at an Airbnb that almost ruined the surprise Hawaii trip for my mother for her birthday.It is without hesitation and definitely without reservation that I highly recommend the Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head for a smart-upscale, boutique property and a warm, personalized, Aloha! experience.The daily resort fee covers the prompt and courteous valet parking, beach towels, beach chairs, bicycle rentals, as well as the shuttle that takes guests to the main areas in Waikiki.Daily Happy hour between 4:00pm and 6:00pm with red and white wine with bar snacks (like popcorn, pretzels, etc.)Daily Hawaiian coffee and tea in the lobby from 6:00am to 10:00am","San Francisco, California","rilliwilli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,5.0

Plus free wifi was so slow!! I did not ending up using it at all. I used about 2 G of LTE, which I m not really happy about. They really need to working on the faster wifi. The restaurant on the 2nd floor has very loud music and interfere with sound sleep.Overall, I do not recommend this hotel, you can pay similar money by choosing fancier hotels such as Hilton, Westin and Sharaton and have direct access to the beach and shopping. We thought we were saving $$ by staying away from the hot spot location but it was not true.","Ontario, California","JazzzyJas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, California</strong>",45,3.0

Absolutely. If you need to be in the middle of chaos, surrounded by shops, restaurants, and people, and you prefer the busy beaches of central Waikiki, then this hotel is not for you. If, however, you like to be ever-so-slightly off the beaten path (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile) and you don't mind the absence of a pool, then read on....LOCATION:The Lotus Honolulu sits next to Diamond Head Crater and the ocean. You are about 3/4 of a mile into the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but it's a seriously easy walk AND the hotel provides bikes. Personally, I welcome the walk back after a meal in Waikiki! Across the street is the Kapiolani Park, a large, well-maintained park ideal for runners, walkers, and dog owners (yes, the hotel allows dogs). Overall, you feel like you're just outside of Waikiki and able to perceive the personality of Hawaii, and yet you're a short walk from the eateries and shops.THE HOTEL AMBIENCE:You won't be greeted here in a grandiose lobby with music and sensory overload; rather, it's a serene, if ever-so-slightly dated, lobby complete with orchids and Buddhist influences. It is inviting and calming. The elevator does need an update, as I felt like I was riding a 1970s lift installed at Disney's Polynesian Resort. This was extremely minor, though.THE ROOM:We were in a ""Diamond Head View Premium Room"" on the 12th floor (the top), which I highly recommend. Looking out one large window, you see Kapiolani Park with Diamond Head in the background, meaning your view is of nature and not a lot of buildings. Out the other window is a view of the ocean, which is slightly obstructed but you can still see the water quite well (see photos). With gorgeous views out of two walls in your room, it feels very bright, open, and airy. Unlike many hotels, this room is exceptionally large with ample space and storage. It also has a mini-fridge, microwave, espresso maker with ceramic cups, water glasses, wine glasses, ample plugs/outlets that are accessible, a PS3, and an app on the TV that will allow you to use your Netflix account (the wifi, however, could be A LOT better). The bed and pillows were on the softer side, which I like, but may not be for everyone. The AC worked very well and didn't seem to fall into the trap of clicking off via a motion sensor (like some hotels these days). The room has two balconies, but only one of them is large enough for chairs and a table. THE BATHROOM:This is one of the larger bathrooms, again with ample storage, that I've had in a hotel. There is a table along the wall that enables you to store all of your stuff so it's not sitting on the counter. That table could use a paint job but it allows the bathroom to be uncluttered, and, frankly, I'm picky and its need of paint didn't bother me. The bath/shower is a European design, where it's a square shower with raised sides so it can be turned into a bath -- but not an American, rectangular bathtub (see photos). Overall, the bathroom is well maintained, clean, and large. It comes with a full-size hair dryer and a magnifying mirror that is attached to the wall.EXTRAS:Like all hotels in Waikiki, you'll pay a ""resort"" or ""boutique"" fee. At this particular hotel, that fee also provides you with free valet parking, which was huge for us, a daily morning yoga class, towels and chairs for the beach, complimentary wine each day from 4-5:30, and free bicycle use, among other things.BEACH ACCESS:You are entitled to use the beach that adjoins the Waikiki Canoe Club. It's a small beach, but it was never very crowded.STAFF:If I could give the staff 10 stars, I would, and that is no exaggeration. From the front desk, to the valet, to the cleaning crew, the attention to detail, thoughtfulness, and helpfulness was superb.FOR THE ACTIVE READERS:I'm a serious runner and found this location to be ideal. The proximity to Kapiolani Park, as well as the $1 entry fee to Diamond Head, allowed me to amass at least 4-5 miles each morning without having to run through the chaotic area of Waikiki, stopping at every light and dodging the masses of people.DRAWBACKS:If you need a pool, there isn't one. The hotel isn't right on the beach like many in Waikiki, but its location -- just slightly off the beach -- affords you the unparalleled views of Diamond Head. The wifi could be A LOT better, and the elevator needs an update.",williamsburg,"kpmcatee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>williamsburg</strong>",26,5.0

Amenities include beach chairs, towels, mats and mountain bikes, and, the afternoon (16:00 - 17:30) free wine and nibbles goes down really well!Access to private bay, which is lovely to take your free wine and go sit and watch the canoes, swimmers, and, the sun slowly going down!Take the free bikes and cycle up to the entrance to the Diamond Head Trek - quite an easy ride and good views - places to lock your bike once you get there.Hotel is clean and tidy, and rooms a good size (we had a King room with views of Diamond Head and a slight sea view).Highly recommended.","Bradford, United Kingdom","BSlinger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bradford, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

I had initially been very excited to book and stay at the hotel during my recent visit to Hawaii. The reviews were good and I had booked an oceanfront view room as per the website description. When we reached the hotel I was somewhat surprised - the lobby and entire building was tired and in dire need of renovation and the hotel is NOT an oceanfront property - there are 2 other buildings between the beach and the hotel. The ""private"" beach near the hotel belongs to a boat club and had speedboats docked, lots of people playing and sunbathing. It wasn't the private beach which we had envisioned at all. The restaurant looked and felt like a throwback from the 70s although the service was nice and our server was friendly. Our room had been advertised as an oceanfront view room - in reality we had a slither of ocean view from between the view of 2 other hotels, and our balcony looked out onto another buildings parking lot. The one saving grace was the room which had obviously been newly renovated and was modern and stylish - and big! The room decor and atmosphere was vastly different from the rest of the hotel. The hotel also had no swimming pool - I understand we are in Hawaii and we prefer the beach, however, we had also been looking forward to lazing around the pool on some afternoons - although in that case I'll take responsibility for not thoroughly making sure the hotel had a pool before we booked it (I assumed it did, most hotels selling at this room rate would most likely have one). At the room rate we paid, we could have stayed at other very luxurious hotels with much newer and more complete facilities. Like I mentioned, the room was the saving grace - and the only reason I didn't decide to move to another hotel for the remainder of our stay ( we stayed for 4 nights).

We've been to Oahu several times and wanted to to try something a little different. Everyone should stay in Waikiki at least once, but it is very crowded and can be a bit overwhelming if you're not from a big city. The Lotus is only a 10-15 minute walk to the center of Waikiki, but it is much quieter and more relaxed. Kapiolani Park is right across the street, and this is about as close as you can get to Diamond Head.The staff at the Lotus are terrific and make you feel very welcome. Parking on site is a breeze, and when we visited they provided free passes to some of the local museums & attractions. The room was a good size with new furniture, flooring and entertainment systems.

I had several days work in Honolulu, and my group was staying right on the main beach in Waikiki. I decided to stay a few extra days on my own and prefer a quiet, less populated area. Lotus in Diamond Head was the perfect choice.I bit funky, but great value. The room was sort of cluttered, with an ironing board propped against the wall in full view...but it was hard to quibble with this when each room also gets its own little patio/balcony, and kimono robes in the bathrooms. Lotus has its own lovely little private beach, which I used for my daily morning swim, beach towels and chairs provided by the hotel (covered by the $25 daily amenity fee.) Bottled water is offered every time guests arrive and leave, and bicycle rentals are included in the amenity fee (I used one...and encourage you to do the same, for the scenic route to Diamond Head!) Beds are very comfortable, and despite being on a lower floor, the room was quiet.Minuses: no pool or room service. You can order food from the on-site restaurant, which I did, and dine at your private little balcony table under the stars (this is a sort of cumbersome workaround, however.) The facility is a little tired in places, and though it's a one minute walk to the beach, the property is not on the beachfront and being on a lower floor, I had a view of the parking lot. If you're used to 4-5 star luxury, Lotus may not cut it for you. But if you appreciate a quieter, boutique hotel run by very nice people, you're in good hands. Daily wine and cheese happy hour, morning coffee and fresh fruit in the lobby all add to the hospitable vibe of this little gem. I appreciated it's quirkiness and would definitely stay here again, should the opportunity arise.","Oakland, California","biggly2000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",11,4.0

We chose this hotel because it seemed to be in a quieter area but still within walking distance of everything in Waikiki. We stayed on the 4th floor, which was just high enough to get a glimpse of the ocean from our balcony as well as a nice view of Diamondhead. The room was very comfortable (especially the bed!) and we really appreciated the use of the in-room illy Espresso machine. Nothing like waking up with an espresso on the balcony every morning with the sounds of the ocean and the birds in nearby Kapiolani Park.All of the front desk and valet employees we met throughout with were very helpful and friendly. The staff seemed small enough that we became very familiar with most of the staff by the end of our stay. They made us very much feel at home at their hotel! The resort has a mandatory 25$ a night boutique fee, which covers your parking as well as other perks including: beach chair and towel rentals, bike rentals (locks and helmets included), morning Yoga classes, and a 4-5:30 wine happy hour with light snacks (at no extra cost). Friends we were staying with made use of the valet parking, which was always very fast, and my wife tried to attend the Yoga classes every morning, which she very much enjoyed. We enjoyed coming home in the afternoon to a glass of wine (which you are free to take back to your room). The closest restaurants to the Hotel are along Monsarrat Ave (you can easily cut across the park for a ~15 minute walk), otherwise there is a decent little beach cafe (Barefoot Beach Cafe) just a couple blocks North along Kalakau. If you don't want to walk or would like to venture a little further, you can borrow a bike (lock included) and easily be anywhere in Waikiki in 15 minutes or less. There is a decent bike trail system in the area if you are wary of riding in traffic. Lotus is also part of the AQUA hotel line and offers a free shuttle that comes around every 30 minutes from ~9am to 8pm and travels between the Lotus and the Ala Moana shopping center. This was especially handy for me, given I was attending a conference at the Hawaii Convention Center, and the driver was very helpful, even offering to drop us off closer to our destination. We only ate once at the hotel restaurant, and though I found the food to be good, the atmosphere was not very relaxing and we felt a bit out of place. They had a dance floor set up right next to the bar with live ""Oldies"" music being preformed. This may be attractive to the retired vacationing crowd (of which I acknowledge probably makes up a large amount of the hotel's clientele), but we did not enjoy it. Kind of felt like we were attending a stranger's wedding reception. We would definitely love to stay at the Lotus again if we are lucky enough to find ourselves in Honolulu again and we'd like to extend our sincere thanks to all the staff who helped us out and made us feel welcome during our visit.","White Bear Lake, Minnesota","Adam H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>White Bear Lake, Minnesota</strong>",39,5.0

Do not really think the rating above 4 is warranted. Cannot criticise the staff in any way, as they were all helpful and polite. The room was on the corner and had wonderful views to Diamond Head, parkland across the road and glimpses of the ocean. Location is good as it is away from busy Waikiki, but a fair distance to walk to. Only two restaurant options, one on site and one expensive one nearby. Room size good and relatively clean. The bathroom although roomy enough and with adequate places for toiletries, was dated and the shower recess ordinary, with limited drainage. Only one hotel lift to rooms, was old and took a long time to arrive on floor. The restaurant/bar located on the second floor, Wisp was fine for breakfast and dinner and does have a happy hour every afternoon. Unfortunately, the two times we wanted to eat there (Friday and Tuesday) the space was taken up by elderly dancers, so limited area for guests of the hotel.

It was recommended to us by my good friend who is a native of Honolulu and knows all the local hotels. The Lotus was everything we expected: a laid back, boutique hotel just around the corner from a quiet beach on the sunny side of Wakiki. We were greeted with a surprise anniversary gift waiting for us in our room -- just one example of the personal attention the Lotus provides and a really special touch which was much appreciated! The location is perfect for folks like us who didn't want to mess around with traffic. The Lotus provides free bicycles which can be checked out, and my wife biked the short route to the top of Diamond Head, to downtown, and along the beaches...she loved it! The nearby beach was wonderful, great for swimming but we had some successful snorkeling time there too. Many days we could see clouds blanketing downtown Honolulu, but it was sunny where we were at the 'Gold Coast'. The Lotus also sits adjacent to one of the largest parks in Hawaii, which we loved. My wife was able to join in an outside yoga group there, and we were able to walk to an oceanside restaurant in the evenings. By the end of our 3-day stay we knew the owner and the folks at the front desk as if they were old friends. The only downside was the wi-fi reception was subpar in both of the rooms we stayed in while there -- it took me awhile to figure out there was good reception in the lobby area, but not the rooms. Overall, this is an excellent hotel if you want to ditch your car and instead bike or walk or just relax -- with the location and the friendly people running and working at the hotel, it was everything we had hoped for!","Waterloo, Iowa","Dennis H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waterloo, Iowa</strong>",4,5.0

The hotel is in a great location near to Diamond Head and we like to stay here as it is away from the bustle of downtown, but a short 15 minute walk to get it if you want. Also like the complimentary bikes. We took them out several times for a ride around the crater, to the Honolulu Are Museum, and to China town. Besides there are some nice perks such as the coffee in the morning, free coffee in the room, complimentary wine and cheese from 4 - 6 and some free museum passes. The rooms are good, beds very comfortable and the views of Diamond Head are spectacular - much better than the ocean views which are mostly obstructed. The corner rooms are the best with a great breeze. We had the windows open most of the time and did not use the AC the entire time. Also a great perk is the valet parking which is included in the $25 resort fee. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Free yoga classes each morning. A very good choice of hotel.

There is a small convenient store next door at the New Otani hotel if you need any food or supplies. The Lotus is not directly on the beach as Colony Beach residences and San Souci condos are in front. However, it is a 1 minute walk to a very nice beach in front of these condo's. The beach is great and usually not too busy. There is a bigger beach next door which is also wonderful.

There is a yoga institute on the second floor as well as the newly opened Wisp restaurant. Quite pricey, an omelet, breakfast potatoes and juice cost my sister $25 plus tip of course. They do have a continental breakfast plan, but I booked this before the restaurant was opened (only opened 2 weeks). Our room was 725, and end room, the best room I've stayed in in a very long time! I will post pics of our view. An insane backdrop of diamond head and partial ocean view. The only thing I did not like about this hotel was there is no direct beach access, you have a tiny and I mean tiny beach to the rear you have to walk between other properties to get to, or go around a building or two on the other side to get to a larger beach. We chose to drive to other beaches due to the fact there were many homeless people sleeping and digging through the garbage cans around the park where the beach is.

We enjoyed the free bike hires, riding to the main stretch of Waikiki and around the park - again they valet parking guys were awesome and attentive to our needs asking if we would like any bottled water. The best thing amongst all this was that everyone was very friendly ... even the bar-dude who put on a stern face to tell people that wine glasses are to stay within the restaurant ;) and then to top it off, as we were on our honeymoon (failed to mention it during our booking) we asked Marci if there were anything the hotel can do for us, she kindly congratulated us and delivered a bottle of champagne and a couple of delicate cupcakes to our room. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who's thinking to stay around Waikiki!","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii","_teeniechris_</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Island of Hawaii, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

I've been told that the Lotus will have a restaurant starting next week and I think that will add a lot. In the meantime, 2 of my nights here, I've just walked next door to the New Otani Kaimana Hotel which has an open air bar/restaurant. I had a nice glass of wine and a couple appetizers which were delicious both nights. Back to the Lotus, the room is very clean, cute decor, bed and pillows very comfortable and the AC cranks! One of my favorite things is their fabulous in room coffee set up with Italian illy espresso! The staff is delightful. There is a $25 daily Resort fee (not sure if that's what they call it), but part of what it covers is valet parking which I appreciated. Every day from 4-6, they have a serve yourself wine and appetizer spread which was very nice with fairly high quality wine (which I didn't expect).

You get the know the staff and they'll attend to your every need. They provided us with a tandem bike to get to the strip and even helped us get rental surfboards delivered to the hotel. In my opinion, the Lotus is the perfect choice for me and I'm definitely staying here longer next time. The rooms are clean, quiet and moderately priced. Considering the resort fee includes valet parking, it's a great deal. I just moved to the Pink Palace for the second half of my trip and I totally regret it.

The staff were very friendly -- we especially liked Russell, who helped us with restaurants and excursions.The location is indeed off centre -- exactly 15 mins walk through the park and takes you to the edge of Waikiki beach, so a total of 20-30 mins walk to most restaurants/shops in town, which we didn't mind, but not for everyone. They also have bicycles available for use, which is a nice touch as it cuts down the travel time. Renting 2 beach loungers and parasol on Waikiki beach will set you back a cool $50 per day, so you can save yourself a fortune by buying a $10 parasol from ABC stores/Walmart and borrowing the hotel's free beach chairs -- these also come in handy when visiting other beaches like Kailua, Lanakai, Sandy Beach, etc. (assuming you have a car rental).There are only 2 restaurants within 5 mins walk -- the Lau Tree Lanai, which is ok... a bit overpriced, and reservation required to get a table. The other restaurant is French, but we didn't try it. For snacks, there's also a convenience store. Btw, there's a restaurant in the Canoe club next door, but surprisingly only serve food to members. Our favourite restaurants in town were Duke's and Eggs & Things, which we preferred over higher end restaurants such as Orchids and Hy's steakhouse (service was excellent, but a bit snooty -- i.e. covered shoes mandatory).For excursions, we did the Holokai Catamaran, which was excellent and only $60 (booked directly on their website) for snorkelling with the turtles and Diamond Head sail. We also tried to do the Shark Adventures which looked fantastic (they put you in a cage surrounded by sharks) but our trip was cancelled at the last minute due to high winds, so try to get this trip in early if interested.","London, United Kingdom","HHHHHHHHHHHH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",58,5.0

They were friendly just the same...we tipped at times and at times didnt...also left a pair of sunglasses there and didnt realize it.

It really exceeded our expectations. Our room was beautiful with gorgeous views of both Diamond Head and the ocean. The staff is extremely friendly and goes above and beyond for you. We love this part of Waikiki, because it's quieter and away from the hustle and bustle of the heart of Waikiki, yet walking distance if you want to see/do things. As locals, we loved walking to Monsaratt Ave and ate at all of our favorite places... Bogart's Cafe (breakfast), Diamond Head Grill, Diamond Head Health bar(best acai bowls on the island) and even got gelato at a brand new little cafe called Ars Cafe! (Tourists- try the local spots we love! Stay away from the chain restaurants in Waikiki) on our last day, we walked to Barefoot beach Bar Cafe which is really close to the Lotus and had a casual breakfast with the outdoor seating. We loved the little wine happy hour they have in the lobby (Daily from 4-6pm) that we got to pour a nice glass and take it back to our room and sit on the lanai. Although this property doesn't have a pool, it has a great little beach that the locals go to and it's right next door to a private club. So nice that they even give you Tommy Bahama beach chairs, towels, umbrella and even beach toys. We are big coffee drinkers too and liked they had illy coffee in the rooms. For you beauty obsessed travelers, the toiletries are Paul Mitchell Awapuhi. A huge bonus, is that it's dog-friendly and our little furry baby got to come with us and enjoy it too! When we checked in, they had a basket for just her. It came with a bowl, blanket, dog bone and a full bag of bacon treats that she loved. Great that there is the park right across the street too that we could take her. We can't wait to come back. We highly recommend this hotel for travelers wanting a unique Waikiki experience.

I mentioned that in the comments section for every reservation I made. A couple places said ""congratulations"" at check in but here there was a chilled bottle of sparkling wine and glasses waiting in our room when we arrived. There was an issue of some old stains on the bedding which required a late night call to housekeeping but the linens were changed promptly and the staff were all apologetic. We noticed a very loud metallic clunking noise whenever the elevator opened in the lobby, and you needed to swipe your key to go any higher than the restaurant on the 2nd floor. This was inconvenient if you were trying to carry breakfast for two back to your room alone. There was a park nearby which was nice to walk through during the day. A lot of homeless stay there so I wouldn't go alone at night. We did walk through as a couple on our way home from the bars and restaurants along Waikiki and had no problem though. The view of Diamondhead was ok but we were on a middle floor (6th) so there were some trees in the way. I'd recommend a higher floor for a better view.

My family with a 2 yr old toddler were meeting with me in Honolulu from Asia while I flew in from East Coast. We booked two Ocean View Premium rooms. The rooms are clean and nice. It is not too brand new, but it is very decent and up to par. The view is amazing - on the left we had a full view of Diamond Head and on the right we saw part of the ocean. It is not a wide open ocean view because the building in the front blocks partial of the view. However it does not affect the beauty of this room. At night, I was able to see the moon rising above Diamond Head. I left the balcony door shade open, so I slept under the moonlight shining into my room. I didn't want to sleep because I wanted to enjoy that beautiful moment!There are no breakfast included, but they have a simple restaurant on the 2nd floor that you can pay, or you can order from any restaurants in Honolulu to deliver to your door. I highly recommend the nearby ""Bogart's Cafe"" for breakfast or lunch. That is the BEST brunch spot - I visited 4 times during my 6 days stay in Lotus. You can ride a bike to the restaurant within 5 mins. The morning Yoga in the nearby park is a must try experience as well as riding the bike around Diamond Head. You will be able to see the beautiful coast line and some really cute local residence. The hotel also provides beach towels and chairs that you can enjoy. The free wine between 4 and 6pm is amazing too. What sets Lotus apart from other big chain hotels with hundreds of rooms is their service. Everyone in the hotel is very nice and warm. Sebastian at the valet service is outstanding by always greeting us with genuine smiles and always offered advice and help for guidance. Parking here is included in the $25 resort fee. It is totally worth it.There were a few glitches during my stay as well:- We booked two Ocean View Premium rooms but the front desk gave us one premium and one regular Ocean View, and realized later that it was a mistake after we already checked in. They gave us credit for the resort fee to waive the difference of prices, but I would wish we could have two premium rooms as requested. - Room 821's WIFI was not working during our entire stay. We had to do some work on laptop but the IT technician couldn't figure out how to fix the WIFI, and did not follow up with us either regarding this issue. We had to use cellphones to do our work. No credits were issued when we mentioned to the front desk upon our check-outs either. - Upon check-outs, one of the room's bill was billed incorrectly for in-room entertainment fee. This was the room which was supposed to be the premium room. The total amount of the bill comes out to be exact as my premium room (with the incorrect entertainment charge). My parents stayed in that room. They didn't watch TV at all but they were charged with this fee. The front desk was able to fix the bill, but I still find it bizarre how this charge occurred.I felt the front desk was not able to answer my questions when I had issue with WIFI and bill. They kind of just want to smooth it over instead of fixing the problem. I wish the management can look into this. Otherwise, all other staff members are doing a fantastic job! I will definitely come back to Lotus again when I visit Honolulu! ","Jersey City, New Jersey","AChuChu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey City, New Jersey</strong>",12,5.0

The wine each afternoon was of good standard, and we loved the coffee machine in the room and the fact that on request for more coffee pods, we were given more the next day. The free DVD's were an unexpected bonus and the ability to purchase continental style breakfast items meant we did not need to go back and forth to the ABC shop. The room itself was very roomy and comfortable and we enjoyed the breeze we picked up on the balcony where we had breakfast and enjoyed our wine. The small convenience shop outside the hotel next door was useful and while we did do the walk into the main tourist area for dinner twice, we mostly opted for the beach kiosk in Queen Kapiolani Park enjoying the casual outside seating and live music watching the sunset.

They do have a free shuttle to other Aqua Hotels in Waikiki area for shopping, sightseeing, eateries- get a map of pick up spots so you can wander Waikiki and then back free to this quiet refuge.

They have beach chairs and bikes to borrow and beach towels at lobby for water fun. Closest restaurant is in the New Otani Hotel next door- heard it is the best breakfast in town, but make a reservation. The Outrigger Club and Elks Lodge are just down the street, but are private. Also a small market next door on the street at New Otani with good prices and everything you could possibly need. Catch the city beach bus a few steps down in front of Elks Lodge for the 20 minute ride to Hanauma Bay for amazing snorkeling. $2.50 each way...go early if driving...lot closes up when it is full in the morning...or go in the afternoon. $7.50 to get in.

Only in the most extreme circumstances will I sit down to draft something (usually if my experience was quite poor or, as in this case, simply wonderful). The Lotus is a boutique hotel about a ten or fifteen minute walk outside of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. So, if you like to be in the center of it all, you may find this hotel a bit quiet (and it hasn't got a pool, if that's important to you). However, if you prefer a more tranquil setting across from Kapiolani Park (perhaps the nicest park in Honolulu), this is a lovely hotel. The best aspect of the hotel, beyond the tranquil setting, is actually the staff. To a person they were extraordinarily kind and thoughtful. From the people at the front desk, to the valet guys helping with the cars and bikes (yes, they offer mountain bikes for guest use, along with nice quality beach chairs and beach towels, and bottled water as you head out for the day), to the restaurant staff and the maid service, and let's not forget the really nice yoga instructors who offer yoga in the park every morning) everyone was professional, patient and attentive. I must say that the entire staff at this hotel may be the best that I've experienced in all of my years of travel, both domestic and international. It may sound strange to say this, but returning to the hotel each day almost felt like going home in the sense that everyone at the hotel made my wife and me feel so comfortable and welcome. I strongly urge the hotel ownership and management to take very good care of the hotel staff. Their professionalism and attentiveness is what sets this hotel apart from your competition.I used to live on Oahu for many years and now live in California (the Bay Area). However, I visit Oahu fairly often each year due to work (my company is headquartered on Oahu) and to visit friends who still live there; and when my wife and I are not actually staying with our friends, the Lotus hotel will be our hotel of choice whenever we are on Oahu.

It was both our first trip to Oahu as we were celebrating our 10 yr. Anniversary. They gave us a room with a SPECTACULAR view of both Diamond head from our patio and upon opening the front door it was an amazing view of Waikiki. The customer service was FANTASTIC. From check-in to check-out and everything in between! Travis (valet) has excellent recommendations of where to eat, places to check out, activities to do he never disappointed! A nice surprise was the bottle of champagne they provided my husband and I upon arrival to our room. So thoughtful!They provide beach chairs, beach towels, cold waters whenever you leave the hotel and a private beach is literally steps away! They also have happy hour from 4-6pm every night near the check-in counter. There's even a complimentary shuttle to take your around Waikiki and to the main Ala Moana shopping mall. It's away from the crowds of Waikiki, but close enough you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, don't think twice!

The hotel is small, only around 100 rooms, all beautifully furnished and equipped. Mini-fridges and Illy espresso/coffee machines, marble bathrooms, and nice lanais with views of Diamond Head and the Pacific. The Lotus is around ten minute or so walk south of the main Waikiki area, across from Queen Kapiolani Park. Seriously underpopulated Sans Souci Beach is just a few steps away, and the aquarium and zoo are easy walks. And the staff on both trips was warm, welcoming, and way beyond expectations in their helpfulness. The hotel does not have a full service restaurant, but it does offer continental breakfasts and complimentary beverages in its second floor dining room, as well as complimentary wine in the evening. There are several excellent restaurants an easy walk nearby, and of course myriads in central Waikiki. There is also a very nice open air cafe about five minutes up the beach, which is both excellent and very reasonably priced for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and affords a lovely al fresco setting by the ocean. The only potential drawback is that if you are too limited in mobility to get to and from central Waikiki (assuming you want to) on foot, you will need to either hop the hotel's periodic (free) shuttle or a city bus to get there and back, or rent a car. There is no charge for valet parking, by the way. ","San Rafael, California","coopersf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Rafael, California</strong>",18,5.0

But as the very kind, professional staff (and my relatives) pointed out, Lotus is not on Waikiki. Rather, it's a mile or more east at the foot of Diamond Head (Leahi), right across the street from the lovely, quiet greenery of Kapiolani Park (itself another 5 star entity). The difference between the Waikiki main drag and the Lotus/Kapiolani Park/Outrigger area is huge--don't mistake one for the other. Lotus, both as a hotel and a location, is like a lovely, green, quiet zen garden, an oasis, a retreat, a safe place with its own lovely little beaches out front. While there are several other tower blocks adjacent to Lotus, the group are all set clearly away from the skyscraper logjam of Waikiki (exception: late night ocean view dining is a Waikiki specialty, so don't miss out). The other reviews here did not mislead or disappoint: Lotus is very clean, quiet and has lovely Asian-Pacific decor in all rooms and lobbies; Room had a superb large bathroom, comfy lanai (balcony), decent free WiFi and perhaps the best hotel mattress I've ever encountered. Free afternoon wine in the lobby? Yup. Complimentary beach gear for all? Check. Warm, engaging staff, who were equally helpful to my family guests? Absolutely. We did not use the valet parking but my relatives did and were greeted with kindness and ice cold bottled water. I even want to put in a good word for that highly addictive in-room espresso machine with its cute little ceramic cups (why yes, Lotus expects adults to be able to use real glassware). Now, many hotels can match such amenities, but Lotus has something others lack: it actually felt warm, welcoming, like coming home, not just resort or chain hotel fakery--the staff are true locals, act like family and proud of their aloha oasis. If I had to say anything negative, Lotus does not have a pool (the beach is way better) and not really a kid-oriented hotel (unless your kids are zen masters), but to each his own. After this experience, I would not stay anywhere else on Oahu and hope Lotus keeps up to their high standards.","Lincoln, Nebraska","Valdyfox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lincoln, Nebraska</strong>",10,5.0

The only downside to this place is that it's far from Waikiki beach. A good 15/20 minute walk to all of the action, but it's super quiet. We didn't have any noise issues. It's one of the trade offs.

We stayed at this property in December 2015, and we had a great experience. The hotel is a small boutique hotel at the quiet end of Kalakaua Avenue, and only a short, 15 minute walk to the action, on the way to Waikiki Beach. Being at the base of Diamond Head, our room had a great view of the beautiful landmark to one side, and a view of the beach on the other side. The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. There is a daily resort fee, which was $25 when we stayed, and it included valet parking and complimentary beach chairs. We were offered bottled water to take along each time we ventured out, and that was a nice touch. The property is not right on the beach, but just a short stroll away is a private beach for hotel guests to share with adjacent properties. Towels and beach chairs can be picked up at the front desk, and they are first-come-first-served. Ask for the beach chairs with backpack straps - they're easier to carry. The beach was very nice, and not crowded at all when we went.The Honolulu Marathon took place on Sunday December 13, and we were right by the Finish Line. We were able to see the runners and cheer them on as they came by the hotel. If you happen to be in town for the Marathon, this is an ideal place to stay!If you're Catholic, St. Augustine By The Sea Catholic Church is less than a mile away. It's a nice walk, and you can stop for breakfast or brunch afterwards.I would not recommend this hotel for children, as there isn't much to interest young kids. Maybe late teens would do ok, but I think this hotel caters more to adults.

We stayed in an Ocean View room and enjoyed its spaciousness, cleanliness and beautiful views of both Diamond Head and the ocean. While it's true that the view also included the parking lot below and a couple of buildings in the foreground, you'd be hard-pressed to find accommodations in Honolulu that combine the spaciousness of the rooms, the amenities of the hotel, the helpfulness of the staff and the peaceful quiet so close to the craziness of Waikiki, especially for the price. We've stayed in other hotels in Waikiki that had a good view of the ocean, but our rooms were the size of postage stamps. However, we loved our room at the Lotus! Every day at 4:30 p.m. we sat on our lanai and watched whales breaching in the distance. We also enjoyed watching the activity in the park below Diamond Head: dog walkers, joggers, kids practicing soccer, etc. In the mornings, we were awakened by the sounds of birds chirping in the palm trees below, which turned out to be parrots (or maybe parakeets?). We took full advantage of the beach, accessed by a very short walk across the hotel lot, which was never very populated and excellent for swimming with no reef. (When you approach the beach, take the stairs to the left, not the right, for the best swimming.) Originally, we ate breakfast closer to Waikiki, but eventually we settled for the hotel breakfast which was reasonably priced and more to our light-breakfast tastes. I can't say enough about the front-desk, breakfast and valet staff who were very accessible and saw to our every need. I want to give a special call-out to JR at the front desk and to each of the valet staff, who made every aspect of our stay comfortable and EASY. FYI: We took advantage of the free Honolulu Art Museum tickets offered by the hotel and were favorably impressed. The museum definitely is worth seeing and the food in the cafe very good. All in all, a perfect stay in Oahu, thanks largely to the Lotus. My husband has frequent business in Honolulu and has decided to abandon his previous hotel for this one. Very much worth the visit.

The fact that this hotel has its own private beach area, you can even take the wine with you to the beach unlike other hotels.

Noise from the parking lot was loud, bothersome, and the view was frustrating considering the price of the room. The staff offered no options to upgrade or change rooms. The only option we had was to cancel the reservation and find another place to stay. The location of the Lotus is literally in a parking lot behind three other properties. Their room categories are based only on the height of the room, with ""Diamond Head"" view meaning up to the 7th floor and ""ocean view"" meaning 8th floor and higher.

Kapiolani Park separates it from Waikiki Beach. It's a boutique hotel near Diamond Head, with a truly versatile small staff, each of whom can pick up another's job if necessary. There's no restaurant, but the classic Hau Tree Lanai is the the right in the New Otani, and the equally venerable Michel's is to the left, both two minutes away. Nice Nespresso machines in the rooms, and delicious Hawaiian coffee available in the morning downstairs. There are beach chairs, towels, etc. available for the asking, for a small private beach by the Outrigger Club just across the parking lot. The view of Waikiki Beach lights is dreamy as night descends, and the Friday night fireworks are close. For a splurge, I might pick the spendy historic Royal Hawaiian, or the Moana with the giant banyan tree, but for peace I'd pick the Lotus any time.

We had never been to Oahu but I have visited Maui & the Big Island/Hilo side more times than I can count over the last thirty years. (Two sisters live on Maui and Big Island.)We had the best time at the Lotus. First, Robert (valet) greeted us when we arrived. He parked our car, took our luggage to our room, and gave the most wonderful, detailed information about the island and the area. He directed us as to how to get around in spite of the crazy traffic in the Waikiki area. He suggested a great dinner spot in the hotel next door and showed us the private beach we could use while staying at the Lotus. Beach towels and beach chairs were provided too.Before going to our room, we met Jana and JR who checked us in and welcomed us to the hotel. We asked more questions that Jana happily answered. We then asked for a regular coffee maker in our room in addition to the pod coffee maker that was already there. She then invited us to have a glass of wine since it is available in the lobby each evening from 4:00 to 6:00pm. It was about 4:30. We then found out that Jana was the General Manager at the Lotus and knew we had chosen the right place to stay in Oahu. When we got to our room, we found a ""welcome letter"" signed by Jana that said ""we are happy to make the necessary arrangements to satisfy your wishes"" and she meant it. We then went out for dinner and when we got back, the coffee maker we requested was in our room along with the shades closed and lights turned on so we didn't have to enter into a dark room. Very nice and welcoming. Our room was fabulous with two balconies; one overlooking the ocean and the other one facing Diamond ahead. This hotel was peaceful, clean, comfortable, away from the Waikiki crowds and SMOKE-FREE. It was a 10 minute lovely walk to downtown Waikiki and we walked there for dinner one night. It was very crowded and people were smoking everywhere. I was so glad we get away from this and knew our hotel would be fresh, clean and smoke free!!!I also want to mention another valet named Travis. He was incredible and was there each morning as we headed out for the day. He gave us great direction to Pearl Harbor, the museums and the Queen's palace. He told us where to go, what to expect and explained little but important details like the lockers at Pearl Harbor since bags are not allowed at this military base. One of our days we wanted to drive to the North and East sides of the island. He again gave us great direction and made suggestions about what to do and see when we got there. Where the ladies like to shop and the local shrimp trucks too. He made the few days we had there very valuable and we got to see lots of what we wanted to see. We will return to Oahu and we will no doubt, stay at the Lotus again. Try it! You will love it too. Thanks Jana, Travis, Robert for making our trip fabulous. See you next time.

The location of the hotel is secluded from the overpopulated Waikiki strip but within walking distance of the major attractions and restaurants that Waikiki has to offer. The entire Lotus staff were extremely warm, welcoming and displayed excellent hospitality from check in to check out. The beach access is a 2 minute walk which you can ask for beach chairs and towels to use, they offer bottled water anytime, and wine in the lobby 4-6pm daily! Other amenities we enjoyed was the free wifi and dvd rentals. The rooms were very clean, spacious and comfortable.

We had the unfortunate incident of having our rental broken into on the way hotel and ALL of our luggage was stolen. After switching out rental and arriving at the hotel we informed the guy at the front desk (forgot his name) and he really couldn't have cared less. Still shaken up from the robbery that had only happened a couple hours prior to getting to Lotus we were a bit surprised... A little bit of sympathy would've been appreciated at that point. After we arrived at our room we called down to the front desk and asked the same you to please let us know straight away if a police officer calls us at the hotel (out cell phones had been stolen) and he advises that all calls are put through a voicemail system so we would receive messages straight away. So we were very surprised and angry the next afternoon when we were told that a police officer had called twice in the past 12 hours - no voicemails, just someone at the front desk who decided to mention it when I called to ask about a late check out. Unacceptable!!! We had just been violated in a country that's not our own and we couldn't even count on the hotel to help us out with such a simple request. Will never stay here again.

You have to go into downtown Honolulu...Since they do not believe in decaf coffee we had to go a half mile to get to a coffee shop. It took us less than 10 minutes to decide we would not stay the three days we had planned. So we stayed and paid for the one night we were forced to and then moved on to a lovely b&b within walking distance of beach and dining and at half the price.

We leave tomorrow and that makes me sad! I figured I should write this review while I am in their comfy bed. We have never been to Waikiki/Honolulu before, but I heard it can be very busy.. And it is! But, this hotel is a bit away from all the hustle and bustle of the busy strip and I LIKE that. I wanted a room that was modern, safe and close enough to the beach. There is a $20ish dollar boutique fee, but let me tell you some of the things that includes 1. Free daily valet service. The valet guys are so nice every single time and always help us load and unload our cars. And they make sure we have waters every morning before we leave2. Free wine in the lobby from 4-6 pm every night. This is SO NICE! They have a comfy lobby you can drink the wine in, or you can take it to the room and drink it on the balcony while overlooking the ocean. 3. Free use of beach towels. Big, new, thick neutral colored beach towels. 4. Free use of beach chairs that they let you take for the day (this was SO NICE)5. Access to small, private beach. Pretty shallow and family friendly. Short walk to Queen's Beach and Waikiki Beach. 6. Bike use (we did not use the bikes, but knew they were there) 7. Free yoga (mat included) in the big park across the street 8. Free movies! There is a Redbox type machine on the second floor. They give you a special card for getting the movies. 9. Bookshelf next to the movie machine for some last minute beach reads. The rooms:1. Dark hardwood floors with a clean, modern rug around the bed. Rooms are so modern and beautiful. It feels like home, not a hotel room.2. PS3 in the room with a flat screen TV3. Big closet with lots of room for organization. 4. Plantation style sliding doors then glass sliding doors for the lanai. 5. Hot water, good pressure. 6. BIG fluffy white towels. Not those small, little hotel towels. 7. Paul Mitchell toiletries 8. K-cup style espresso machine in the room that makes DELICIOUS coffee. 9. Small mini-fridge. 10. Very comfortable beds. 11. Ocean view! You are not Ocean Front, but we still had insane views of the ocean and surfers and sunsets. You also have an absoutley unobstructed view of Diamond Head which is a icon for Oahu, so its very special to see that too. We slept with our lanai open every night. 12. Waikiki view when you walk out of your room. Its breathtaking. Housekeeping was very trustworthy. We accidentally forgot to put away our laptop, DSLR, Go-Pro and my purse while we were out one day. They were on the bed and they stayed there-- they just serviced the rest of the room. Everyone is SO NICE. I did not come across one single rude or annoyed employee. They all smile and wave and are so helpful! That hospitality was so appreciated.Go to Barefoot Beach Cafe or LuLu's for breakfast. There is also a small convenience store at the hotel next door.

This is one of the few hotels I've stayed in where after looking at the rooms online, they were just as the picture advertised. THAT's what I appreciated most. It wasn't that they only had one updated room that looked this way and that's the one that they posted in their advertisement.We had a corner room with two balconies on the 7th floor. Very nice view of the ocean and diamond head.The Location: Great location away from the hustle and bustle. It's about an 8 minute stroll from the nearest Starbucks. It's at the beginning of the residential area. When I read this, I initially had some concerns. But once we arrived, I saw that it was the perfect area. Across from a park also.The Staff: We are a very friendly couple and will stop and engage ANYONE. And the staff indulged us. We'd stop and chitchat for a bit and they were quite indulging. They offered suggestions for dining and site-seeing. They were the best. The person assigned to cleaning our room was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.I have nothing bad to say about the Lotus. Not one negative. I thought I'd have an issue with them not having a pool. But while I was there, i didn't even miss it. Sitting on the balcony enough for me. No exercise room, you'll walk around the town anyway.OR ride one of the bikes available to the guests.No room service, no problem. You're just a short walk from eateries. While they do offer some breakfast items, I passed as they didn't really have the menu I could appreciate. Want to stay in, you can get free dvds on the second floor.

Control your own AC or let the breezes come in through the big sliding doors. Housekeeping is excellent & friendly. Room was always very clean & cleaned promptly & quickly each day. Linens are above average in quality: plush.Usually plenty of street parking along the park but it is metered during the day. Free at night. Yes, they write plenty of parkign tickets in Honolulu.The check in process is smooth & fast. One elevator = sometimes a wait but not bad.The true stars of this hotel are the valet guys. Yes, I know, how can that be you're asking. Well, there's a mandatory 'boutique fee' of $25.00 per day. Which, let's face it, is a gouge - - but so many hotels are doing this now. So, it is what it is.Well, you have to valet your car if you park on the property. Not enough spaces in tight confines, that sort of thing. Yet, the valet guys really are the face of the hotel. The valet guys work very hard 24/7 to get you whatever you need. Cold bottle of water, beach towels with your ride? Keeping your car up front & readily available? Storing surfboards, kite gear, anything you don't want to trundle to your room?Done, done, done & done. These guys are the stars of the Lotus. Travis, Robert, and several others: all great. Tip them handsomely, they will certainly earn it.I'd say it's worth it to be in an upper floor room. The view of Diamond Head crater is pretty cool. You will also be able to see the ocean, although the view directly off to the right is obstructed by the big hotel between Lotus & the ocean. You can almost see the wind whipping around Diamond Head. Bring binocs & you can check out the surfers over at Tunggs.The free coffee is good. Mornings from 0600-1000.

Sat outside on lanai (it says there are two but you can actually only sit on one). Both corner rooms were very clean, sunny, and open.

It's at the Diamond Head side of Waikiki beach, near some condominiums, across from the park and within walking distance of everything. The lobby has a Zen vibe, with sofas, cushions, fountains, mirrors, candles, etc. It's a comfortable place to hangout with the pre-dinner wine glass. The room was on a corner, with a balcony and windows overlooking the beach and Diamond Head. It was clean and roomy, with a safe and fridge. The staff was friendly and helpful, offering advice and water bottles. We borrowed chairs and towels for the beach. You can go to a quiet beach shared with a canoe club, or walk a little more to a bigger, Waikiki beach. This is located at the end of the bustling Waikiki strip and you have to walk a little to get to the action, but that was fine with us, because we wanted quiet at night. If you're not a ""walker"", you need a car or taxi. Taxis get expensive. We took one to Diamond Head and it came to $16 each way. The breakfast isn't included, but it was reasonably priced, with various options, the restaurant isn't in service right now, which is a shame, because it has great views of the park and Diamond Head. I took a Saturday morning yoga class in the park, which was included and the hotel provided the yoga mat. It was of moderate difficulty and a beautiful practice under the expansive trees. You get more for your boutique fee than we got at a higher priced North Shore resort: unlimited coffee, daily wine, beach towels, chairs, unlimited water bottles, free yoga classes. There is also a shuttle to the other hotels in the chain, that you can use to get around a bit. It stops at the big mall, Ala Moana, too. The staff called the driver to let us know when he'd be coming around, so we didn't have to wait.

It's clearly an older hotel that's been renovated to more modern standards. Location is a bit of a bust, views are pretty bad, beach access isn't great, and there's only one elevator for the entire building (used by both guests and staff and it kind of has a mind of it's own) but the staff is super friendly and helpful (we really appreciated the offers for bottles of water whenever we were leaving), and the rooms are clean, modern, and comfortable. Major cons: Location, it's not so far out of Waikiki that you feel like you're escaping the crowds/traffic and yet it's not close enough to Waikiki to be super convenient (shopping, restaurants, and access to the heart of Waikiki beach are about a 10-15 minute walk away). In fact, unless you're familiar with the roads in the area, you'll likely end up having to go all the way through Downtown Waikiki to get to the Lotus anyway (which kind of negates a lot of the benefit of staying outside of the busiest areas).The hotel is in between the street and a couple of other taller buildings so ocean views are practically non-existent (though the view of Diamond Head is nice even though you have to put up with street noise to get it). There's access to a beach one building over though it's not as nice as you'll get towards the heart of Waikiki.Major pros: The staff is excellent, very helpful and friendly and they remember your name. Rooms aren't terribly expensive given the proximity to the beach (cheaper hotels are more inland) and I'm pretty sure that the Lotus is one of the better values in the Waikiki area all things considered.Overall, I'm not sure we would stay here again. It's kind of stuck in a grey area. It's not cheap enough to be a bargain hotel and yet it doesn't have the location or facilities to be high end. It's kind of average overall despite the strength of it's staff. I definitely think you could do worse than stay here but I'm pretty sure you could do better (both in terms of price and/or location). You could make an argument that the hotel is very reasonably priced given that it's on the seaward side of Kalakaua Avenue but a counter argument could be made that it's location at the far southern end of Kalakaua actually makes it harder to get to than some of the more inland places.",New Jersey,"d0uble_J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",42,4.0

The hotel loans bikes & helmets for free as well as chairs to take to the beach! Well away from the crowded Waikiki area of Honolulu but we took several fabulous walks on the beach, promenade & through the park to Waikiki; not far at all (15 minute walk max which we enjoyed a lot). Park is perfect for jogging; lots of joggers especially in the mornings. Simple breakfasts available to purchase at hotel & they made breakfasts for us to take on the go on in the mornings when we had to leave in a hurry on day trips. Many activities on Oahu including some terrific hikes. I stayed at this hotel last year in 2014 with my husband & loves it so returned this year with my two teenage sons.

The fact that the hotel does not have a restaurant didn't bother us, There are so many great breakfast spots throughout Honolulu. Try Bill's, Kokohead Cafe or Kaila's to name a few. The fact that the hotel does not have a pool also didn't bother us, Kaimana beach has a fraction of the crowds that Waikiki has and the water in our opinion is just as nice (3 minute walk away). The $25 boutique fee not only included parking but also several bottles of water throughout the day and complimentary wine in the evening. Most Waikiki hotels charge $30 or more for parking only. The room itself was very clean and spacious. We requested two double beds that could not be met at check-in so they gave us a King and a roll-away bed with a comfortable (roughly 6 inch mattress) instead at no additional cost. Worked out good for us and the room was easily big enough. Did I mention that this hotel is much quieter than all hotels in Waikiki, and for the people that complained about having a view of a parking lot..... it's better than sitting on your balcony and looking across at the people sitting on their balconies like we have had several times before in Waikiki. If you don't PAY for oceanfront, you are going to be looking at some structure of sorts. We will definitely return to this hotel, also the staff are exceptional.

Rooms had been recently updated and were comfortable and clean with all the amenities.  Every night in the lobby, wine was provided and you could stay and visit with other guests or retreat to your lanai for a glass of wine before dinner. They also served a continental breakfast each morning on the second floor for a nominal charge, but the coffee was free.

Granted it's midnight, our flight arrived three hours late - we've just checked in. I must say I am disappointed. Our room is on the 5th floor, ""view"" is of a parking deck. The room itself is very clean and lovely - no robes, etc. The bathroom is nice, shower doesn't drain, so if you're in shower more than 5 min, you're in a bath. I am very disappointed. The front desk gentleman is kind and courteous - but they can't move us until tomorrow. I feel deceived and that we overpaid for a less than stellar ""premium"" room.

The reservation, of course, had a cancellation policy that guaranteed the hotel one night of revenue if I should cancel late, or no-show.So I was shocked and dismayed when I arrived at the hotel and my room category was sold out. And, instead of being offered an UPgrade, which I've had happen in similar scenarios in the past, the only option I was given was to DOWNgrade. So the entire reason I had booked this hotel, and my entire ""treat"" to myself, was instantly destroyed.You clearly CANNOT COUNT ON THE LOTUS TO PROVIDE THE ROOM CATEGORY YOU'VE RESERVED, GUARANTEED, OR PAID FOR.This kind of overbooking (followed by DOWNgrading) when a hotel would have penalized ME for not showing, is simply insane. I'm sure this happens at other hotels as well, as they try to maximize their revenue streams at the risk of screwing their guests. But I've never had it happen quite like this. The only reason I didn't give a ""one star"" review was because the room *was* clean and comfortable. Too bad it wasn't the experience I had reserved.","Kirkland, Washington","GeekStar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, Washington</strong>",25,2.0

We had a corner room on the 7th floor. This gave us 2 balconies, with views of Diamond Head and of the Ocean in between the nearby hotels. Nice size room, comfortable bed, air-con, good size bathroom with plenty of towels each day (and refeshed at turn-down service). A 15 - 20 minute walk along by the Ocean up to the heart of Waikiki Beach (very busy!) We didn't eat at the hotel, but found a nice cafe - The Barefoot Cafe - about a 10 minute walk from hotel, right by the ocean. It was nice to sit outside by the beach eating breakfast, which was very good value. Wifi was free, there was a fridge in the room and we were given complimentary large bottle of water each day. Staying at this hotel also gives you access to a small nearby beach, which we enjoyed. The hotel provided small beach chairs and towels. It was lovely to swim in the sea.I would have given this hotel 5 stars, but for the lack of resataurant facilities. We arrived at 10pm after a long flight from NZ, but there was nowhere open nearby to get anything to eat or drink. The hotel restaurant does offer a limited breakfast, but is not open at any other time! Strangely, if you look up the restaurant (it's called The Park) on Trip Advisor it has reviews, but when I questioned this at reception they said it closed a while ago due to lack of customers!Also, when I pulled the bedside table out to look for a socket to charge my phone, I was dismayed by the amount of dust and some rubbish behind it!","Skipton, United Kingdom","alison29Yorkshire</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Skipton, United Kingdom</strong>",30,4.0

The location is excellent -- down the strip and away from the madness of Waikiki, but an easy 20 minute along the ocean into the ""thick"" of Waikiki fun. We had a corner suite with two balconies, with a view of Diamond Head to the left and the ocean to the right (though if you go with this option, ask for a floor higher than 5-- we are on the 5th floor, and the tree top partially blocked our view of the ocean). The room was thoughtfully appointed, plenty of towels and toiletries, very quiet, and very comfortable. Our room also had a mini-fridge. I most appreciated that the $25/day resort fee included the amenities of valet parking, WiFi, yoga mats, beach towels, and in-room coffee service (as well as yoga classes three mornings/week), so there were no ""surprise"" additional charges at the end of the stay. (Lots of hotels tack on a $30 valet fee in addition to the resort fee, which is very cheeky, in my opinion.) The hotel also made bikes available, but we did not use them.Beware, however, that there is no pool or restaurant in the hotel. One hotel over (the Lotus is grouped tightly with two other hotels), there is access to a quiet beach, which we never saw crowded (again, unlike Waikiki). The hotel next door (Otani Kaimana) has a restaurant right on the sand (the Hau Tree Lanai). To breakfast at Hau Tree Lanai, make reservations with OpenTable. Alternatively, a five minute walk takes you to the Barefoot Beach Cafe (mediocre food, go for the view) and a fifteen minute walk takes you to Tucker & Bevvy, in the lobby of the Park Shore Waikiki, which has excellent breakfast paninis and breakfast smoothies.","Santa Monica, California","Jennifer_Ballet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",58,5.0

Once again we reserved the corner room up high with views of the ocean and Diamond Head. Everything was up to high standards. I got the flu and for two days stayed in the bed with a fever and I felt like I was in my own bed. Such a beautiful view when you are sick. After worse of it was over, we rode hotel bikes, went to the beach close by and started to enjoy Waikiki.Since our first visit, the hotel owners now have 2 shuttles that travel around Waikiki and stop at all the hotels they own. This was quite convenient and we could walk short distances to where we wanted to go. There is an app so that you can see where the two shuttles are at any time. NICE. The park across the street is quite lovely too.
