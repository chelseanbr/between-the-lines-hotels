When I posted this on Marriott.com I received an email asking me to contact the hotel. I did but the person who emailed was no longer employed and whoever answered had zero interest in why I'd called. Upon checking my review on Marriott I see that Mia Fowler responded claiming no harm was done because we ate in the lounge. My review noted this wasn't true, we paid to eat out. She also claimed to have put 5,000 points in my Marriott account for our inconvenience but it's coming up on two months and nothing has credited.Advice to property, when you mess up and email a customer asking them to call in, don't blow them off when they do. More advice. When you promised a token amount of points to make up for a larger loss, at least follow through.Not a bad hotel but sloppy management.","Portland, OR, USA","Edelman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, OR, USA</strong>",19,3.0

However, given its location (Manhattan) and the fact that I've had my share of stays at incredibly subpar properties in the area, I'd consider the Sheraton to be a decent place to stay, especially when considering the price.Rooms are spacious enough, breakfast is decent enough, it's reasonably clean (although it could stand to use a refurb in the near future) and has fast WiFi. The right kind of business hotel that does the job and doesn't break the bank. This is my third stay there, and won't hesitate to return should I have meetings nearby.","San Jose, California","KI-NRT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",148,3.0

The rooms are very small and for me at least, good for 1 person to relax in comfortably. Most of the time I've gotten rooms facing east or south which means very little to any view but recently I (somehow) got a west facing room which faces towards the Hudson River (although you need to have a higher floor to get the true view). Rooms have been renovated in the last few years with the typical Sheraton standards----clean and comfortable and they usually stock the bathroom with all the amenities you might need.Staff has also gotten better----in the past they were a bit gruff but now are much friendlier and helpful. If you want/get Club access, the Club has terrific views including an outdoor terrace (which is open to anyone staying on the Club floor). The Club is smaller than most and can get very crowded if there are more than 15 people in there. The location is central to SoHo and downtown/FiDi (about a 15 minute easy walk). If coming from JFK, the E train stops right around the block at Canal Street making it easy to get to or depart from. Lots of terrific bars and restaurants in the immediate area and while there are many pricier ones, do look around on the internet as there are many reasonably priced (and fun) places here too.","Los Angeles, California","mattsontop</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",7,4.0

For being in NYC, this hotel is actually a great deal.The hotel itself is out of the hustle and bustle of Times Square (where I ended up anyway due to a broadway show). It was an easy subway ride from our hotel to Times Square. If you are traveling by subway keep in mind it’s $2.75 per person per ride. The subway stop is Canal St but it’s a few blocks walk to the hotel. It’s easy to miss it if you aren’t looking for it, look for the large post office on the southeast corner. We got to the hotel around 5PM and during our walk we were harassed by the typical Canal St dealers selling their knock offs. If you aren’t interested, keep your eyes down and keep walking. We got a standard room for under $100/night which was an amazing price for NYC. Being Marriott Elite we were hoping for an upgrade but on a Saturday night there were none available. Hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, we made our way up to our room and was pleasantly surprised. Room 1620 was the typical small size but had a gorgeous view of the city. The room could use an upgrade but it met our needs just fine. The room looked right out to the NYC skyline, seeing Hudson Yards, the Empire State Building and everything in between. During the day it was nice but at night you can’t capture how pretty it is. The bed was comfortable enough and we both had a decent nights sleep. We got 2 free bottles of water in the room along with a larger bottle for purchase for $4. If you have lounge access, just go and grab a few bottles from there if you need. The only time the room was too small was when my wife was sitting at the desk and I needed to get to the chair on the other side of the room. I couldn’t squeeze through so I had to roll over the bed to get there.Being elite, we get access to the lounge on the 21st floor. This was also small but nicer than other lounges we’ve been in. They have the same gorgeous views of the sunset but just a bit better because of the additional height. They have a nice happy hour every day from 5-7PM. They offer free wine or beer plus some snacks like cheese, hummus, veggies w/ dip and chips and salsa. We heard there was food there and thought we’d be able to eat dinner there but that wasn’t really the case. There was a good amount of food but I wouldn’t plan a dinner around this. We did enjoy about 7 glasses of wine amongst the 2 of us so I can’t say anything bad about the lounge. The noise wasn’t too bad from the outside. Not sure if it was the fact that we were on the 16th floor or that there wasn’t too much car traffic in this area but I didn’t hear anything throughout the night. Overall this was a pleasant stay and hotel and I would stay here again versus being right in the heart of the city.","Stamford, Connecticut","travelbydna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stamford, Connecticut</strong>",3,4.0

For us the hotel was perfectly situated. We could walk to the World Trade Center sight, thete's a great deli and coffee shop next door. There are 2 different subway stops, one right around the corner and the other maybe 2 blocks away. There is also a great little Italian restaurant around the corner recommended to us by the concierge.The concierge was amazing. So funny and full of life. He was like watching a show with everyone. The room was nice but it seems the windows aren't double glazed because I have stayed in lots of big cities and this room was by far the noisiest. You heard every noise outside. The room itself was large but weirdly configured. To get into the teeny tiny dark closet you had to move the nightstand to open the door. I needed my flashlight to see inside. In order to see the TV from the bed you needed to lay on your left side as it is directly next to the side of the bed. Our room had a very comfy chair and sofa. There was also a large kitchen table and 4 chairs...weird. I think the whole room needs to be redesigned.The executive lounge was small and very hot with a limited breakfast selection. Not what is expected in an executive lounge. However in the warmer months, this lounge also has a huge outdoor area with amazing views. Again a redesign is needed and a refurb as the furniture is all dirty and stained. Nice touch in the evening is free unlimited booze.The staff are all exemplary. From the minute I arrived everyone was wonderful. Housekeepers, front desk staff, executive lounge staff and especially the concierge.As a lifetime Titanium member I have stayed in lots of Marriott properties. For me it served ir's purpose for a 4 night stay but I don't know that I would want to stay longer.

We stayed for one night this past weekend and had the following issues: 1) 20th Floor room was incredibly noisy from both the street (which is understandable, it's NYC) but also from the elevator, which generated a loud banging noise all night. This hotel is poorly maintained, has thin walls and is long overdue for renovation. Do not stay here if you need to sleep. 2) The Sheraton ""Lounge"" is a gross exaggeration of what you're getting. The Sunday breakfast ends at 9am, the earliest I've ever seen for a weekend breakfast, and food/beverage options the rest of the day are minimal. Not worth the upgrade. 3) Service at the front desk can best be described as apathetic. There seems to be no incentive or desire to do anything but the bare minimum.

This is a great hotel. Staff are professional and friendly. We always got a lovely greeting when leaving or entering the hotel. The location is just brilliant. We used the subway for the week and it seemed that every train stopped on Canal Street where the hotel is based. Yes turning right out of the hotel means you do come across some street sellers which may seem intimidating at first but they are not. Once you say no they move onto the next person. Turning left and then left again puts you into a really lovely area with great restaurants and the best pizza slice I have ever had. Room was very clean and much larger than we expected for New York. No real noise issue but then again we were tired from exploring all day. One block up and you are in Soho and would pay much more per night. Easy to walk to One WTC.

We usually stay in Mid Town and then fall into the trap of never leaving the Times Square area. We got outside our comfort zone a bit and hung around Chinatown, Little Italy and the Village. The hotel is an area that might scare off some people. It's a little sketchy on the edge of Chinatown, but it's the ""charm"" I love about the city. The hotel itself is great. Modern with a huge bar area on the first floor. The young man who checked us in, Sal, was super cool and very professional. We did not utilize the gym on such a short stay, but did check out the lounge on the 21st floor. 24 hour access to water, pop and snacks is always appreciated. There is also an outdoor patio up there, which offered a fantastic view of the city to the North. We stayed in a King on the 11th floor. Typical small NYC room, but quite cozy. Good AC, fantastic shower and comfortable bed for all activities! Clean and modern. Not much more to ask for.We also received a nice email from the assistant manager, Mai, when we returned home.

Here’s why: - first major downfall, no contact details for the hotel can be found at all! No email address across, Expedia, trip advisor, Sheraton website, Facebook page. Nothing! No way to confirm your room prior to arriving!!! Something that needs to be addressed! -Check in process was ok, nothing special with staff, didn’t really go above and beyond however was quick. Didn’t touch on wifi so we had to check that it was complementary. - room wasn’t serviced until really late in the day or early morning so be sure to use your do not disturb sign if you would like to sleep in. - Rooms are not quite, noise from hallway and outside sirens/ traffic is normal. This only bothered us a few nights with loud people in the hallway, however the rest of the time was ok. We were on level 10. - Rooms are not smoking however we did smell weed within the hallway etc.- Towels and linen are clean and crisp. However there is no doona per se it’s sheets on top of the bed. - Room is small, hard to have two cases with luggage out. You get that most places in NY so this is average. - We requested a fridge on the third night we were here to be told they had none available, after requesting again in person they were able to send one up. Rooms should come accompanied with a fridge, wouldn’t have been a problem if staying one night however for two weeks it was nice to have a cold drink or milk available for a tea or coffee in the morning. If your staying a while I’d request one prior to arriving. - Pillows were very flat! It did say on the website they had a pillow menu available however it wasn’t on the in room guide. We didn’t eat in the restaurant, only had a drink at the bar. Was good value during happy hour. It’s not advertised however Friday and saturdays have free drinks and nibbles for members in the 27th floor lounge. This was a nice touch, along with festive drinks and hot chocolates in the afternoons in the lobby. The location is central to those using the subway and if you don’t mind walking to locations like china town, Wall Street, little Italy etc. 99c pizza and delis are a short walk too! Overall it was ok. I wouldn’t stay here again however I wasn’t overly impressed nor disappointed.","Perth, Australia","348reviews101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",36,3.0

The rooms were clean, but there is a lot of road noise. The location is very close to China town and a stones throw from Tribeca. My issues revolve around the hotel using a very dangerous taxi company to take us to JFK. He was extremely dangerous, weaving in and out of traffic on the Freeway and we had at leat 4 near misses. I had to yell at him to stop at least three times. He also had an iPad in the front seat and I do not think it is ieagl to watch programmes on it and still drive, To add insult to injury he over charged us by $13 despite it being an agreed fare with the hotel. I emailed Marriott customer services at least 3 times and never had a response. I eventually rang the hotel (at international call rates) and complained to Sal (the hotel manager). He assured me that they would take that particular taxi driver off their books and refund the $13 via the travel agent. My issue is that the hotel should throughly vet the drivers before and not put their guests lives at risk. Ina addition, I have never received my $13 refund, despite t at least 4 emails to BOTH Sal and Mia. I have also rang the hotel and every time I get to reception and ask for Mia and Sal I am always cut off. When everything is ok, the hotel will communicate with you. When they need to learn from experience, they seem to not bother or care about their guests. I have stayed at a number of hotels in Manhattan and I have to say the customer service in relation to this incident has been atrocious.

Check-in time was 3pm but we were coming off a cruise so arrived early at 11.30ish. We knew the room wouldn't be ready but wanted to leave our bags to walk round the city so we did this and were told our room would be ready, as expected, at 3pm. We walked miles and ended up getting back, totally exhausted, at 4.30pm. Plenty of time to have a quick nap and get changed in time for our restaurant booking at 6.45pm. But our room wasn't ready. We were told to wait another hour and that we could wait in the club lounge. They made this seem like a special treat even though it was included with our booking anyway. So we waited until 5.30pm and called back down. Still not ready!! They said it would be at least another hour which meant we'd have to go to our restaurant booking as we were, sweaty and under dressed. I also have a slipped disc in my back and it was hurting so much that I really needed to just lie down. We went for the meal and returned for us to finally be allowed in our room at 9.30ish. We collapsed onto our beds and I logged in to the WiFi (included with our room)... or tried to. There was no WiFi signal. I stepped outside the door to the room and tried again and sure enough it worked. Our room was seemingly the only place with no reception!

This was massively inconvenient as we needed to make plans and call family members, especially as I had my 30th birthday while we were there. Also, on the last morning we had breakfast in the hotel and one of the waitresses was literally holding her head in her hands when greeting us, clearly suffering from the night before!Seriously, the price might be tempting but this hotel is not worth it!!

I have spoken with My manager and she approved for me to give you back one night. As far as the other nights being that we were never made aware that you checked out early unfortunately we wouldn't be able to refund you the rest of the nights. I will send you over a folio with the refund amount . Sorry about the inconvenience and if there is anything else that I can help you with please feel free to reply back to this email. ""I thought to myself, I am wasting my time corresponding with hotel over charging me for the 10th August for a room I never stayed in. So they charged me for 3 nights for a 2 night stay. They quite obviously don't believe in customer service or satisfaction. It would be great if I could discuss this discrepancy with the Hotel's General Manager, but unfortunately I am unable to get those contact details.I have used Sheraton Hotels for over 30 years around the world, this experience has left me extremely disappointed.","Sydney, Australia","John F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",25,1.0

Great front desk staff and I had room service twice both times fast and food good. I flew SFO-EWR because this hotel is literally a couple of blocks from where the Holland Tunnel starts and ends. The issue, it was 9/11 and while I arrived around 8 PM I had goosebumps the entire time I was a mile or less from Ground Zero and the lights that night were over powering. I was in SF on 9/11 but the emotions I felt 18 years later being near that hallowed ground were as if it happened all over again, very, very emotional for me and I have to say the hotel staff was prepared and I was not the only person having these feelings.

Music blasting in the lobby area 24/7 is not necessary. Would not stay here again.","Austin, Texas","weezieo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",67,2.0

Overall the staff were very helpful and always offering a greeting and advice when requested. The Executive Lounge on 21 was full most mornings and nights due to the holiday period. Due to special events the evening drinks were served in the lobby restaurant over the holiday weekend. The lounge staff were always polite and helpful. Guests sometimes pushed them a bit given the number of people wanting to be served but they did try their best to accommodate all. When the numbers reduced service was excellent. Food choices were limited but overall reasonable variety and quality. Was great to be able to get a water and soda whenever required.As expected the room was not the largest in the world but good enough for our needs. Great views of Empire State Building and Times Square area from room with better view of three sides from the Executive Lounge Balcony. The location was great for local restaurants in Little Italy and Chinatown with a good coffee shop, Italian and Japanese restaurants within a two minute walk of the hotel. Also great takeaway pizza place for late night snacks within 50 metres.

Normally, I don’t like to stay on lower floors due to the street noise of sirens, honking cars, etc.. But the patio rooms are on the back side of the hotel overlooking a side street, with very little traffic.The patio rooms are the way to go, if you can get one, there are only 4 of these rooms. While the room was small with little space to move around, the patio was very large with seating for 4. I think the patio was bigger than the room. It was nice to have a private outdoor space just to myself to relax after a day of activities. Just wish there was a table on the patio.  The room consisted of a standard bathroom with shower, king bed, wardrobe for storage, safe, desk with chair, and TV. The room was a bit dated and could use a refresh, however, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate with excellent water pressure in the shower. One issue we discovered is that the thermostats are off by about 10 degrees, we set the a/c to 63 get the room cool. I noticed in the concierge lounge the thermostat was set at 60 and the lounge was comfortable. The concierge lounge is accessible 24/7 with access to a rooftop patio that faces uptown. In the evening, a bar was setup on the rooftop. In the morning, we had breakfast which consisted of eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast, yogurt and pastries. It was a bit crowed in the morning, with folks waiting for seats. We ate around 8 am. The hotel is conveniently located near multiple subway lines. Several restaurants within walking distance. The price was very reasonable at $190 a night and no destination fee. I tend be more price conscious in large city given the amount available hotels. I would stay here again, if the price is right.","Cincinnati, Ohio","859TK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",107,3.0

I also confirmed with them upon check out that they had my Marriott Bonvoy membership number - they confirmed this and reassured me points would be credited 1-2 weeks later. The invoice never arrived, my emails were not answered and so I had to go back after 4 days to follow up on my invoice. It is three weeks now, I am coming back from various business trips back-to-back, and I haven't received any loyalty points either.

The location is great, the hotel and service was a major let down. We had two significant issues during our four night/five day stay. The first issue was our room AC did not work. Our room was a good 10-15 degrees warmer than the hallway. The first night we were tired from our travels and slept ok. The second night we both woke up in full sweats as room kept getting warmer, We visited the front desk the next morning and we were told it would be fixed or we would be moved to another room. Later that day when we came back to the hotel and it was not fixed. A new front desk person then told us she had no record of our morning report and that she had no other room for us. She sent up maintenance and he played with it and then said not to open the curtains the rest of our stay. We hardly slept the next two nights, we made an effort to not stay in the room at all during the day. It was miserable, I made two reports to the front desk and never heard back until I filled out a random survey after the stay and then they said here is 6,000 points for not sleeping. The second issue was the club lounge. They could not handle the crowd and made no adjustments, Two of the four mornings they ran out of hot breakfast an hour before closing. They were consistently out of bottle water and soft drinks. The entire experience in this hotel was poor. With so many Bonvoy options in NYC we recommend you skip this one.","Herndon, Virginia","Patrick n</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Herndon, Virginia</strong>",16,1.0

Amazing view of the Empire State Building and city. I have to give the staff a heads up. Our room was not ready when we arrived but Sal Angioletti the front office supervisor let me look at some of the rooms that were and as soon as I saw our room I knew we had scored a great room. He took so much time out of his busy day to make me happy and I could see he did that for all the guests he helped - it was wonderful to be made to feel at home in a hotel we were about to spend the next ten days. I cannot say enough about how helpful the staff were (especially Sal) they helped in so many ways and everyone was so pleasant. My only complaint is that the Buffett in the lounge was pretty limited as was the Buffett in the restaurant however the staff in the lounge worked hard to keep it stocked and keep a busy lounge flowing smoothly. I have been a Marriott member a long time and most of the lounges supply more options for hor’dourves and breakfast. The other issue was the fire alarm went off at 9:00 am and there wasn’t an announcement made quickly so people were confused as to what to do and the elevators were shut down (as they should be) but still not working at 11:00 long after it was determined there was no emergency (which was the only time I regretted being on the 20th floor.) I would say the Buffett is a small issue and it’s not often an alarm goes off so neither would stop me from staying here again!,,Linda W,0,5.0

From the moment we checked in it was all positive. My wife had emailed them previously and told them this was in effect our honeymoon combined with our wedding anniversary as we had been unable to take a honeymoon when we got married. We were very kindly upgraded to a higher floor with club access and a fantastic view out over the city to the Empire State Building. How awesome is that for a first visit to New York!Check in staff were lovely and welcoming and very helpful. Our room was great. Not huge but certainly big enough for our needs and was clean and tidy. Only thing I’d say was missing was a fridge. Especially as the weeks we were there the temperature was between 28 and 34 degrees. But other than that we could not fault the room at all. As part of our upgrade we had breakfast included in the lounge on the 21st floor. What a wee gem this place was. Breakfast was great with a pretty good selection of food and drinks and to top it off aRooftop terrace with fantastic views of the city and the Empire State Building. This lounge and terrace also has a happy hour every night between 5 and 7 with drinks and snacks and a bar out of the terrace on a Friday and Saturday night. Nothing nicer than a cold drink sitting out on the rooftop on a nice warm summer night with views of New York City all lit upThe Location Of The Hotel on Canalstreet was perfect too. Close to a host of Subway stations for the various lines on the subway made travelling anywhere easy. Also situated just outside Chinatown, Little Italy and Soho making allOf these places accessible with just a short walkEvelyn from housekeeping was fantastic. Very friendly and helpful she kept our room spotless and kept us well well supplied with water and the usual toiletries and towels etc. A real credit to the SheratonCheckout was easy and again the staff were helpful. We had to check out at 12 but our flight was not until11 that evening. They stored our luggage for us in a secure room and this was no issue for them.

This was very nice as it allowed us to spend some time in the room when we needed rest. We had a great time at the hotel because we had club level rooms, but the rest of the hotel was unimpressive.

If you can, purchases and upgraded room with club level access to enjoy complimentary beer and wine with choice appetizers. The breakfast provided in the lounge was excellent as well. The lounge attendant was quite knowledgable on local places to eat, drink and attend while visiting the city. He was very personable. There is a great fitness facility on the second floor which was cleaned daily. I noticed it being cleaned the same time both days of my stay. There were up-to-date cardio machines and weights along with the Sheraton Fitness branded tips.

I had a very positive experience. With such a long stay, I sprung for their 'Club Level' package; so my room was on a higher, (actually the highest), floor. Which was great if you're as sensitive to noise as I am. (This is NYC people - pack some ear-plugs! Or download a white-noise app.) The bathroom had the GREAT addition of a magnification mirror on the side wall. The toiletries were ample & of decent quality. The water pressure & temp remained at a consistent level throughout my morning showers. There was a full-length mirror just outside the bathroom. In addition to the chair at the work-desk, there was a very comfy lounging chair with ottoman in my room, (such a great touch!). Every single Sheraton employee who I had dealings with, or even a short encounter with, was terrific. (This was a bit of a shock to me...) The Club Level breakfast offerings were ok, (though the scrambled eggs weren't very good, unless I used a lot of ketchup!). I really liked their addition of sauteed onions along with the sausage. There were three options of cold cereals and an ample variety of breads, muffins, and pastries, etc.. Also, plenty of coffee, water, juices, and even soda. For the evening offerings, there were basic noshes - crackers & tortilla chips, one kind of cheese cubes, and then one kind of luncheon-meat (rolled up). Also a pasta salad. They served several wines & beers. (Also, they had a cash-bar in the Club room, if you wanted to have hard liquor as well.) I'm not much of a drinker; so I mostly just enjoyed the breakfasts and then the viewing deck for the Club Level upgrade. The Sheraton Tribeca is VERY well situated with short walks between four (4!) subway lines that I used every single day of my stay - such a great location for public transit. I can think of two areas for improvement - the lighting in the bathroom was on the dim-side. And, the in-room coffee maker was a bit of a spitter.... After the first cup of coffee, I made sure and kept a washcloth handy to contain the water leaks/spurts.",Michigan,"LizMSK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",46,4.0

We called repeatedly to tell them that the water was not fixed and we got a curt reply of: ""oh you have to run it for awhile"" and after informing them that we had done it for a few minutes they said it had not been fixed. This would have been fine if it happened once but we tried several times over the course of two days and each time we mentioned it we were given the exact same reply. On checking out we were told that there were no extra charges to be paid, again in a disinterested and curt manner, but then received a charge the next day on our credit card and trying to find out what the charge was about was like pulling teeth.

The rooms are comfortable but not very modern which does not makes much difference as in a city like New York , you only come to the hotel to sleep at night. Overall, it was a good experience , not v noisy like Times Square Sheraton . I would definitely stay here again.

I arrived several hours before check in and the front desk took care of checking me in (room was not ready though) and storing my luggage (no charge - did tip when I picked them up). I am a Marriott Bonvoy member do they upgraded my room to include Lounge access (complimentary breakfast, snacks, coffee, waters and soft drinks). The room I stayed in on the 15th floor had a decent rooftop view looking east. Decent sized room (for NYC) with a queen bed, desk (with desk chair) and restroom. Bed was comfortable and you are able to open the window a few inches which is nice. The heat/air worked great. I left the fan on high to drown out some of the hallway noise. I will say that my room was near the bank of elevators so I did hear lots of loud conversations while others waited for access to them. The windows did a good job keeping outside noise out as you could hear a tremendous difference when you opened them.Lots of shopping in nearby Soho too - just a couple minutes walk away.Several subway lines were within a block or two that would get you to most places in a short time. I flew into LGA and it was about 55 minutes from getting in the MTA system. The lounge breakfast was simple with eggs, sausage, pastries, breads, yogurts and juices. It was a great treat if you are trying to save a few dollars on a meal to get your day started. Happy Hour - this was a very nice treat that I didn’t expect. During my stay (Saturday-Tuesday) from 5-7 each evening there was a FREE Happy our in the Club Lounge in the 21st floor. A few wine options, a few beer options and light snacks. I had a few beers each night (prior to going out for dinner) and simply tipped the gentleman that served us. Other places I ate charged $7-$10 for beer so this was a crazy good deal. It was busy each night with little room to sit. There is a rooftop area with additional seats and nice views but the temperatures were a bit chilly during my visit to linger outside.You should consider upgrading to Club access if a free happy hour, free breakfast and drinks excite you. I think if you have two in your group that could easily add a significant value to the room at the Sheraton Tribeca.Checkout was noon and the desk was happy to store luggage if you wanted to explore and come back later to retrieve the luggage.","Linwood, North Carolina","chrisnc44</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Linwood, North Carolina</strong>",13,5.0

Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about this establishment. Upon checking in, I was not greeted and had to ask to check in. The lady had some serious attitude despite my reservation being incorrect on Sheraton's behalf (I had called to make this reservation). Two rooms were booked when I specifically asked for one room to be booked. This same disturbed lady made it seem like it was my fault for this mistake and said they will have to late cancel this room for a fee, but since I have ""status"" they waived the fee. No apologies were made. Unacceptable. I ordered a bottle of champagne for the room and when it was delivered it was room temperature. I asked the delivery lady if I could have a chilled bottle and she said she would ""check"". She did end up delivering a chilled bottle, however I had a hard time paying the already included 20% gratuity when there was no attention to detail. The morning of checkout I had a knock at the door and it was someone ""just checking to see if our room was still occupied"" at 10:00 am. Checkout is 12. After already being irritated at my stay, I again asked the front desk to check out. The lady just looked at me waiting for me to speak. There was no greeting, she did not acknowledge my request, but just looked at me like I was bothering her. So I just rattled off all of my info because I didn't know what she needed. These all might seem like small complaints, however for this Hotel to be considered a Marriott property, is unacceptable. Being a lifetime Gold member I have definitely had enough stays to be able to compare. I choose to stay at Marriott properties because of the great service and overall great experience, but sadly I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NY. With all of the hotels in NYC and competition, a friendly greeting and professionalism at the concierge desk would greatly improve guest's experience.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Scenic00636369783</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",13,2.0

From the moment we checked in it was apparent that this SPG hotel was substandard. Adjoining rooms were not available even though I booked these 2 rooms months in advance. Excuses were many and I was never given an option other than we had rooms ‘near’ each other. (I did ask for a suite that could accommodate 4 adults but was told they were all booked) My reservation confirmation clearly said extra towels and feather pillows. When we saw these requests were not provided, we called the front desk only to be told ""no you did not request that"" even though it is clearly on my reservation! Additional supplies were delivered but short 1 pillow and we were told the extra pillow would be up soon - never saw it in 7 days!! After that day we were never provided extra towels either. The elevator hallway at the lobby level is very dark and has illegal light level. We told the front desk and we were told that this is Marriott standard. It was under 10% and one of my guests is an architect who knows the regs! It was increased for a few days but lowered again later in the week. Elevators require a key to access floors and we noticed that many people had issues with their key cards allowing them floor access – we had the same issue intermittently over the 7 days. In one room (1907) we had various disappointments - one day no toilet paper another no Kleenex another no bath mat. We had a plastic drinking cup on the floor for 4 days - we left it there to see if the cleaners ever really looked. The hair on the bathroom floor (which was ours due to hair washing and drying) was never swept up. Beds were always poorly made with linens lumpy looking and bed skirts caught up in the sheets. Breakfast in the lobby on Saturday 9 Feb was cold because the Sterno pots were not lit. The waiter ,when told, quickly took off to find a way to light them and came to us to say they must have just gone out. I had already taken a picture and surprise there were no Sterno pots!This is a big health issue - needless to say we ate bread products and stayed away from the ""hot"" foods. The website says it has airport shuttle - well that is not true however the front desk will call a cab or limo service. I said I could do that myself. Our second room 1906 was extremely small and suffered similar issues. I am an SPG Platinum Premier Elite with Ambassador member. I obviously travel a lot. And have many SPG nights in the cities where their hotels align with my needs. I travel globally. I can say without reservation that this hotel (which is a franchise to Ascott Reit) is very poorly run and the staff under trained. Sheraton and now Marriott are allowing this franchise to diminish their brand. All a hotel can offer, after a bed to sleep in, is SERVICE. Not everything can be perfect all the time however staff can respond to issues in a way that underscores that quality and service are job ONE. This hotel is just OK - nothing special, just an older and dated facility with staff that are not engaged or excited about working there. The club floor food is very poor (try the Hyatt Grand Central for a good Club Level experience) The staff we met over 7 days did not even try to enhance our stay. My Ambassador did try to connect with me by phone 2 times but I choose not to call back because this was a problem too big to be fixed by one call from Corporate. So bottom line is I will not be back to this location and I will return to the Hyatt Grand Central as my NYC hotel. SOHO was great and a nice change from Midtown but like hotel rooms in NYC there are also many cabs in NYC. Next time I will pay for cabs to SOHO and stay in a hotel that will offer superior service to their valued members.","Kingston, Ontario","Patricia S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingston, Ontario</strong>",1,1.0

Also not near any of the tourist spots even though not hard to get to them on subway. Hotel itself is only just ok, beds are good enough, rooms are small servicing is a bit hit and miss with team and coffee and sugar etc not reliably replaced every day. No fridge in room, although they will bring one of you request. Lifts get crammed in the morning and trying to use the stairs is a nightmare and I discovered the bottom one of the fire exits is stacked with supplies, a huge hazard if there was a fire. When I pointed this out to a front desk staff member I was told that I shouldn’t have been down there, when I told her that wasn’t the point and that they should clear it out or get a FDNY Report she sarcastically told me to have a nice day.

I did not book an advanced purchase rate so I was puzzled as to why my card had been authorized when I wasn't scheduled to arrive until the next day. I called the hotel and spoke to someone named ""Sal"" who reported that no matter what rate you book, it is the hotel's policy to authorize 1 night stay prior to arrival. This is mentioned no where on their website nor in my confirmation email. He was very rude and kept repeating that this is their policy when I informed him it was not okay as this was not mentioned to me at all nor on their site / confirnation. I later learned this was a lie. I asked to speak with a manager and he said he was the manger. I also later learned he had lied again. He was not helpful at all and told me to take up my issue with corporate. I called Marriott and the lady said this policy is incorrect and no where did she see this policy nor was it in my conformation. She escalated this to her manager as she wanted an investigation into this ""made up"" policy and apologized for the unacceptable charge / error. We didn't even know what the total amount unauthorized was for because there is no invoice or confirmation stating the random amount he charged my card. The next day upon check in, my card was charged AGAIN for the 1 night but this time the amount matched what was on my confirmation!!!! I was only paying for 1 night but because my card was charged twice, I spent over 900 for a mediocre hotel room. If my card had not been authorized without my consent the day before, I would not have had double charges on my credit card. They are completely unprofessionally and it's a scam. The quality of the hotel is equivalent to a 2 star hotel , not 4 star and for the headache of scamming your credit card, it's best to stay elsewhere. I will NEVER stay here again and definitely not another Sheraton property ever. Sal doesn't deserve my business and Sheraton TriBeCa is not worth it if this is the low level of professionalism I must deal with before, during, and after vacation.

One large tip: ALWAYS spend the extra money to stay on the business floor. Why? Because you get access to the rooftop that not only has incredible panoramic views of NYC but also offers a quiet respite after a long day. There are unlimited snacks, water, coffees, teas and sodas available to you there throughout the day and night - and a breakfast spread in the morning. This is also with NO additional cost. The best part though is the rooftop happy hour that offers wine, beer and cheese for several hours as the sun sets. After spending $20 for a drink most places - especially in Tribeca or the neighboring Soho - you will be delighted to enjoy a few beverages with this particular view for “free” ... and nice wines at that. Deon - who has been there for nine years - is phenomenal during the Happy Hour. The rooms are pleasant but pretty standard. The staff is very kind and quite attentive in my experience. I have thoroughly enjoyed that I have always been given the same room each time I’ve stayed - I’m not sure if that’s coincidental but it feels very comfortable every time I arrive. Finally I highly recommend 5 Boroughs pizza across the street if you are looking for a cheap but delicious snack. This neighborhood offers endless possibilities.

Overall, I found it ok but below what I expect from a SPG/Marriott hotel at that price point, and apart from the lounge access I didn’t feel like my platinum status was recognized. The service was a sloppy, and employees were doing the bare minimum while making you feel like they were doing you a huge favor when they were just doing their job. For instance in 2 of the 3 checkin occurrences, there was no shower gel in the room when we entered the room. I also asked for them to bring and prepare the bedding on the couch for the one night that I had planned to sleep in my parents’ room, but I had to ask 3 different times for them to only bring the bedding to the room and not even prepare the bed. There were a couple more instances where service was lacking but let’s move on to other annoyances: elevators take forever in that hotel (it can take more than 5 minutes to get to the lobby or the lounge), and it just feels a bit old in general. The rooms are small but that’s ok, I’ve never had a huge room in a New York hotel. The breakfast is also disappointing, very few options and the ingredients don’t seem to be of the highest quality. On a more positive side, the location is very convenient to visit the city, and right by a metro station.

As an SPG well traveled Platinum member, I was not given an upgrade and made due with a connecting room (could hear tv in the adjoining room) on a high SPG preferred floor. The bed (photos attached) was lumpy with deep indents (photos attached) but the room was clean. No refrigerators in the room (disappointing) and the bathroom is well worn but clean and functional. The most attractive aspect of this hotel is its location. When you walk out the front doors - to the left is Tribeca, to the right is Chinatown and Soho is in front of you. And the rooftop club lounge - there is a fantastic outdoor space attached but the lounge itself (food/decor) is mediocre and small. They do have sodas, water, coffee available and a ho-hum breakfast. I suggest getting food and a bottle of wine and eating on the outdoor rooftop. I would stay here again purely for the location and relatively decent price for a Manhattan hotel.

Immediately across Canal from the entrance is SoHo and immediately to the rear is Tribeca. Two of our favorite neighborhoods. Within 2 blocks is access to every major subway line with Greenwich Village and the Theater District just short rides away. Over the last decade or so, we’ve stayed around Manhattan, but no hotel has been able to compete with this location. Theater is the primary reason we visit, but we HATE Time Square and adjacent (convention) hotels are way too busy. Within blocks is world-class shopping and less touristy restaurants. Green Village and Washington Square Park are an easy walk up West Broadway which is right outside the front doors. This hotel is a great value with room prices that are very competitive for NYC. The staff is very friendly and accommodating including housekeeping which left us notes every day. This is not a convention hotel. The rooms are typical NYC rooms, which is to say smallish, but very clean and adequate. There is no concierge but the desk staff work hard to meet that role. On our recent visit, my husband was celebrating his birthday. He loves chocolate cake so I contacted the hotel in hopes of securing a small chocolate cake. They could not accommodate this request but they sent someone to a nearby bakery for a large slice of chocolate cake (at no cost to us) that was waiting for us in the room with a very nice note.

Last week was a high occupancy week in NYC between this and Pride events. My travel plans came together at the last minute, and I missed out on advanced booking discounts. This hotel was one of the few that had rooms in my date range under 400.00 a night. In a panic, I booked and was eligible for the AAA discount, so my room was 312.00 before taxes, discounted from 380.00. Checkin was a disaster. The CSR, let's call her ""Twinkle"" with the platinum wig, seemed angry from the start and rushed through my checkin. When I asked to verify the rate and the perks offered by the AAA booking that I made over the phone a couple days before, she rudely retorted that no such deal was in the system, and that my room was 379.00 before taxes, and there was no city view, no access to the lounge level with breakfast and cocktails. I showed her my confirmed reservation email, and she said there was absolutely nothing she could do, and that was just how it was going to be. I then asked for her manager, and she angrily stormed off and found her supervisor who took over the checkin process. Well Twinkle kept interjecting while the supervisor attempted to locate the reservation that showed my deal. I eventually complained about her attitude to her supervisor. Neither seemed pleased that I went there. Well miraculously, a room with the specifications promised to me appeared on the system...but I was made to feel this was a grand favor being granted to me, and something was mumbled about a failure of their system to have synced with the central reservation system, or some such excuse.This hotel is old and dated, but the room was immaculately clean. The breakfast and cocktail hour buffet in the 21st floor lounge was excellent, and redeemed my stay. I had dinner in the lobby restaurant the first night as it was very late. Terribly overpriced for a micro slice of frozen salmon with veggies. I paid 70.00 for that meal and one glass of red wine. Cafeteria quality for fine dining prices.I cut my four night stay in half, and moved to another hotel (Dream/ Chelsea/ See my review) which was incomparable at a rate of 389.00.

Check in staff and bell man are nice. However, when it comes to the room assignment and members recognition, its a disaster. After checking in, I found the key card holder was for Gold member, so I wondered if there was any misunderstanding as I should be a platinum and should be entitled for an upgrade to best available room (I know, subject to availability). Hence I verified with Front Office. The lady who assisted me was just arrogant and unhelpful. She didnt even ask my surname and just said: There is no upgrade available. For me, its totally fine. However her attitude was so unwelcoming. She added: there is no membership on profile in 1 second. Oh come on, there were 2 registered guests! Obviously she just checked the profile of the one who was not a member. So I stated my surname and asked her to check again, she finally confirmed that I am a platinum. This is really awful. At night, I found my room is very noisy due to the mechanical sound of the lift nearby. I should have quiet room preference on file! I called to guest service and the lady just: There is not any other room available tonight within 1 second. The lady must be very familiar with their room situation. Alright, but, how come I can still find different room type available to reserve in official website? So now I am typing this review in the noisy sleepless room.This is all already addressed to the hotel and i am glad there is a front desk supervisor return email to say they would like to follow up.

Since it was my birthday we received a really nice and warm welcome from Nelson (thanks for the drinks vouchers!!). The room was amazing and the view most definitely! The mini bar however was empty, but free water and coffee were just fine. I really have to point out that the bed was like HEAVEN!!! We got in early all nights of our stay just because of the quality of our bed... We also had entrance to the club lounge, which was fine. I do wonder if all the guests there were allowed to make use of the lounge (annoying drunk young-adults from a few floors down also had access, though I was told only guests from the 21st floor should have access...)The Front Office team have been super helpful all the time!! Special thanks to Felitta Hakim for working with such passion!!! Just talking to her could brighten up your entire day!! But... There is one thing I feel strongly disappointed about... I have never seen such negative and unwilling staff working in the hotel bar... Ordering a drink was answered by a sigh and eye roll, and we actually rather went having drinks somewhere else or take our drinks up to the room than staying there. I was told these employees are outsourced, but remember; they are also the business cards of the company!!!

The location is great. The people are great from the front desk, housekeeping, and the employees in the club lounge. Not excluding anyone else, but since I've been here a week I've noticed how hard Deon has been working during happy hour in the club lounge. He always had a positive attitude and sometimes the room was overflowing with guests. He was always moving either cleaning, serving or preparing. My only concern is that since I've been coming here a few years, I have noticed the quality in some areas decreasing. Specifically, the food available in the club lounge. Breakfast used to include eggs, bacon, etc. but now it is strictly stale pastries and fresh coffee not even available at 7 when they open. In the evening they used to serve beer. Now it is just wine. I was given a coupon to try the breakfast buffet. They also open at 7. I was there at 7:15 one morning and the eggs were already extremely dry and sausages burnt. I'm hoping this isn't an example of Marriott's influence in buying Starwood. Again, overall a good experience but you may want to make food choices elsewhere.

We explored around Soho some nights and found some great restaurants and also walked down to China Town one night. - During our stay, we experienced a mix of services from the staff.

At 8 pm I call and ask about the fridge and am told they don't have one and may or may not have one tomorrow. I asked to at least get a bigger ice bucket and was told I can only have the one in my room. So now my hard pumped milk is slowly spoiling as it doesnt fit in the tiny bucket any more.

I booked this hotel at a premium price thinking I would get at least a decent experience. Our heater in our room was broken when we got in, it’s the peak season of winter. Our room keys suddenly did not work, which was annoying since we had to go back down after just receiving them. One of the nights, we had to wait 15mins for an elevator because Two out of the three elevators were not working. The bed we slept on was slumped to the point we could feel the springs against our backs when laying down. We requested a new bed, but they required us to move at the moment (We had dinner reservations) or else they could sell that other room. We ended up being late to our dinner reservation and had to wait even longer, throwing off our plans. On the positive side, the place is clean(expected), the front door gentleman’s were very nice/accommodating and location is nice.

Rightly so, the location is good. Close to three different Metro lines with walk-able entertainment while being outside of the insanity of midtown. Unfortunately, this is a substandard Sheraton.Check in was completed by a very friendly agent (the only good service I had). However, my SPG status was not recognized nor was I offered an upgrade (the hotel was not full). The rooms are standard NYC rooms, small but comfortable. The hotel is clean as would be expected at a Sheraton. Before heading out for then evening, we wanted to enjoy some cocktails at the hotel bar. Enjoyment was not possible. The bartender was rude, barely seemed to care we were there and seemed annoyed every time we ordered a drink. The tab was extremely expensive ($25 for a double vodka and soda), which I can understand due the location, but I would expect the service to match price. The next morning comes around and I was woken by slamming doors and chatter, which went on for hours. Again, as expected in NYC, noise does occur; this was excessive. It turns out the problem is twofold, 1. My neighbors were coming and going all morning, and 2. The room attendant staff is loud and my room was positioned next to service elevator and entrance.While cleaning rooms, the attendants come in and out of a room, allowing the door to slam each time and not propping the door open. I called down to the front desk requesting to move. The agent on the line was rude, did not apologize, offered no compassion or compensation, telling me I was already on the quiet side of the hotel. When I requested to move anyways, the agent sounded exasperated and put me hold. I was given a new room, however I would have to go to the front desk to get the keys. My new room was similar to the previous, as expected, except it includes old towels with holes and frays. Also unfortunate was that the noise and slamming doors of the room attendants was not better. Overall, the hotel is fine. But the service, lack of attention to detail and treatment of customers is borderline terrible. I get the impression that management does not care or is not present.About the reviewer:36 year old single male, well-travelled American.

We had some SPG points saved and the only or one of the few properties we could apply our points was the Sheraton Tribeca. We went for this since we had been to NYC numerous times but never experienced this area -- so for us, it was a cool first. Some cool shopping spots are about 10-15 min away on foot and other places we wanted to see like the Brooklyn Bridge were about 20 minutes. The property was decent -- quiet, clean and not overwhelming. Staff was attentive, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable about the area. A few spots nearby to get food, beverages, quick meals, etc... Fitness space was small (3 treadmills which were full) but pretty standard for a property of this size.Elevators were a bit slow and not every staircase allowed you to exit on the first floor so it took a few minutes regardless. Overall, a nice stay in an area we never experienced so it was much appreciated. Not the most aesthetically pleasing property but perfect for this quiet (and cheap) getaway we were looking for.","Toronto, Ontario","Bigtings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Ontario</strong>",22,4.0

I would describe the Sheraton Tribeca as a mid-range hotel, with average-size rooms and amenities. It is perfect if you are looking for an economical place to stay, that is modern, clean, and has friendly staff.Check-in: At the front desk Kaylene (I'm pretty sure that was her name!) greeted us and helped us get checked-in. Although we were early, and our room wasn't ready yet, Kaylene made sure we had access to the Club Lounge so that we could go ahead and have breakfast. Fantastic! We checked our bags with the bellman, ate, and went out for several hours to explore the neighborhood. We returned later to pick up our luggage and headed up to our room on the 19th floor with a fantastic view. Club Lounge: On our first night we also made it back in time for the nightly Hors d'ouevres in the club lounge. Now, I realize that Hors d'oeuvres is a fancy french word, but you shouldn't really expect fancy, French (or otherwise fancy) food; again, this is a mid-range, economical hotel. What you will find are a good selection of cheeses, crackers, chips, dips, fruit and, most importantly, wine! Perfect for us, and we actually had ""dinner"" at the club lounge several evenings during our stay. And I want to add that Deon, who staffs the club lounge in the evening, provided excellent service. He's very friendly and helpful, and can get you what you need if something isn't available that should be.The lounge space is actually very small, and does get crowded. But it is attached to a fantastic rooftop area that is pretty cool to visit (weather permitting). The lounge is open 24/7, and always has water, pop, and milk stocked. Snacks may or may not be available depending on what time of day it is.Room: Our room seemed normal-sized to me. We had a decent view (not sure which direction) and the beds were comfortable and clean. We did discover two issues with the room once we were a few days into our stay. First, the tub drain was very slow, which meant that water backed up during a shower. It got to the point that we would turn it off to let the water drain out before continuing with our shower. Second, the dehumidifier fan in the bathroom was not working. So the room often ended up being super-humid and hot after several people showered. And the shower curtain was not completely drying and had a smell to it as a result. We had to keep the air conditioning blowing to solve the problem. So, you might want to check your shower/bathroom fan before settling in. We'd been there for a few days already so we just tried to make it work.Neighborhood. It's Tribeca folks. Not Times Square. Not Central Park West. Not kiddieland. If you need something to do the best tip is to research the neighborhood before you go and plan out your activities accordingly. To me, it really wasn't a ""walk outside your hotel and find all these amazing things to do"" kind of area. And if you end up walking the few blocks down the street towards Chinatown, yes, you will absolutely run into some sketchy characters (and maybe get a contact high). But, that could happen anywhere in NYC, or probably your 'hood too. If you're into artsy stuff, there's lots of independent artist spaces, pop-up shops, boutique clothing/furniture spaces a few blocks over. If you want to do serious shopping, there's a great mall at One World Trade Center that is partly underground and partly above ground where the designer stores are located. There are two playgrounds that are fairly close but we only had time to visit the one at Pier 21. My kids had a great time there and even jumped into a pick-up basketball game. There were sit-down restaurants but we didn't go to any. We did visit the Black Burger (a tiny burger joint), which was just aiight, and Billy's Bakery for some cupcakes and brownies, which were good.Staff: I've already mentioned Kaylene and Deon. There were a few bellmen and another front desk person who were great as well. Was everyone perfect? No. Was the cleaning lady a little cranky? Yes. But I cut her some slack because I had to bother her for like 17,000 towels after one of my kids got sick and I understand that she probably wasn't expecting to use all the towels on her cart in my one room. :) Overall, people were friendly and happy to help us get the things we needed.Whew! In sum, have realistic expectations for the price you're paying and the neighborhood you're staying in, and you will enjoy this hotel. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.","New York City, New York","threemo2law</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,4.0

What a Gem for New York. I can’t say enough about the staff. They were top notch and above everyone else in the area. We checked in at around three in the afternoon and was greeted by a polite young man. Sorry I forgot his name. When we got to our room, it was definitely a wow factor. The view that we had was so spectacular that my two kids were all smiles. Never mind the wife. She was just taking it all in and loving every minute of it. We were on the 22nd floor at The Presidential Suite so we got to use The Club Lounge on the 21st floor. The drinks and snack in the club lounge was decent. The free appetizers at night was a nice touch. Now to the area that we were in. It was the best hotel for what we needed to do. SHOPPING!!!!! SoHo is just around the corner from this beautiful hotel. So my new word that my two boys taught me is HypeBeast. What is it you might ask? Well it means whatever kids or pop culture wears for there style. You follow suit to what there wearing too. So there are plenty of stores around there for that type of clothing. But it comes with the price tag. $$$$$$$$$$$$$ the stores that are around there is BBC, Palace, Stadium Goods, Off White, Nike Lab, Supreme and KITH.

We didn't realize under a day or two in that if we walked in the other direction, we would be in a much nicer neighborhood - live and learn.I will say that we upgraded to the club level and that was a tremendous waste of money. We went up for appetizers every night and there was basically just crumbs. Same with breakfast - a could of sad bagels and bruised fruit. They didn't even have waters laying out for us to take - we had to ask for them and then they were the tiny, child sized bottled water. It certainly was the most poorly stocked club level I've ever stayed on.The room was nice sized and the bed was super comfy.

Therefore, we decided to wait the hour for the room. We returned 90 mins. later to find out our room still wasn't ready. I was unhappy since we had to get ready for dinner and the show. Therefore, the front desk manager scrambled and found us another room. When we got upstairs to room 1809, we discovered it was directly across from the elevator (which is counter to what my SPG profile says) and it was hot and stuffy in the room. We called guest services who advised us to turn down the temperature and place the unit on auto fan. We did this, but it was still warm when we left 30 minutes later.We arrived back at he hotel around 11:15 pm to discover our room was still hot and stuffy. We requested a room change. We were given room 1706, which was also warm, and significantly smaller than our previous room. However, by 11:30 pm, we just wanted to go to bed. By the time I turned in after midnight, the room had cooled a bit, but the air was blowing directly on my neck in the bed. I was bone tired so I sucked it up, pulled the covers up to my chin, and went to bed. Unfortunately, my neck was still when I woke up thanks to the Ir blowing on me.Our stay wasn't great.

Just off of West Broadway, you can walk to great restaurants and shops.

While it is conveniently located if you want to be in lower Manhattan, particularly Soho and Tribeca, the experience is unbalanced. The rooms are very nice - NY-small, but nice. Checking in has been annoying several times - especially after 8 pm. There typically is only one person on and there is inevitably some issue with the person ahead of me, so it has not been fast or smooth. I've called for a Wake Up Call and had the phone ring for an extended period of time without being answered.The restaurant is old-school Italian at night, with nice food on the high-priced side. The breakfast buffet is uninspired and not worth the price. Both the Starbucks and restaurant don't open until 7 - which I find late for a business hotel.This time the bar was hilarious - absentee bar tender and no other bar staff for most of the time. But when she did show up at random occasions, the service was fast and pleasant.The elevators are slow - my colleagues have had to resort to walking down at busy morning times to avoid missing a meeting.I feel like I'm in an altered reality when i stay in this hotel.","Toronto, Canada","nankram</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",4,3.0

We arrived around 10:30pm to 11:00 pm.We were tired from driving for over three hours to get there. Our plan was to crab a quick bit, go to bed and have an early start the next day. I have a habit of checking the sheets before I jump in. I found hair and stain on the sheet (see pictures). This is suppose to be clean sheets. Look at how crinkled they were. Looks like someone rolled in it for at least a few days. It was disgusting!!!! They didn't even try to hide it. It was just there... very obvious. Personally, I think there should be a law against hotels renting out dirty rooms !!! Someone needs to pay. Right now there is no recourse. We paid for the club floor (higher floor), the manager said he would move us to the second floor without refunding the difference. At this point, we did not feel comfortable anymore. What if they move us to another dirty room? We decided to book a different hotel - we ended up at NoMo SoHo. It was more expensive but more out scene and a much better location. We were refunded but what we went through was a major inconvenience especially for that time of night. This hotel needs to overhaul their housekeeping team. People need to be fired on the spot for pulling a stunt like this. I feel they are giving the guests a big middle finger. BTW... The phone was dusty too. As for my fellow travelers, be vigilant!!!

I found the hotel was clean and tidy on entry. Jamie on check in was the first person to greet us and she was really lovely and had us smiling even though we where tired from our travels. She managed to check us in really quickly without any problems. I spoke with Sal a little after check in regarding a delivery I was expecting and he did a great job helping me with that and the subsequent follow up that was required, after the delivery firm made an error. It would have been nice if that had made it to the room however it was all a little thrown out by the delivery error. The RoomThe room was a good size for NYC and the view was amazing from the room. The only issue was the toilet flush tended to be a little intermittent, and on a few occasions I had to fix this myself, I'm sure had I raised the issue it would have been sorted. However for me it's quicker to get stuck in and sort it out. Victor was looking after our room each day and he did a great Job I can't thank him enough. He always took the time to say hi to us and crack a joke as we passed him, a really nice guy and he was always working really hard whenever we saw him. Club LoungeThe club lounge was tired and didn't have a toilet on the same floor we found this a little odd. You had to go back to your room if you needed the loo. The outside club veranda had the best views you could want in NYC easily on a par with the Empire state and Rocker fella, however it was in need of a tidy up and a few $ spending on it as it was tired and dated, I expected more from a big NYC hotel in this area. The evening snacks where very basic. Little things like bringing cushions in when it looked like rain was going to come down, background music and modern lighting would have been good. Possibly a wind-out canopy and power wash the floor. All small relatively low cost things that really would make a difference.The club staff did a great job at breakfast and of an evening. Deon and Alexia (I think her name was) really went out their way to keep the lounge tidy and well stocked in the evening even when really busy. Both really lovely people and put a lot of effort in to checking in with us to make sure we had everything and give us advice on the city. On a few occasions people seemed to be using the club lounge to hold personal gatherings for friends or associates that where not staying in the hotel, that was a bit off putting as we paid for that privilege, and the bar should have been used for that type of gathering especially when busy. LocationOverall a great hotel and location sitting on the edge of China town and Little Italy. This offers fantastic transport links and access to subway lines within a block or two. E line subway takes you uptown to time square within 15 mins and down town to the trade centre within a few stops. Loads of places to eat and drink around the hotel all within a walking distance. We stayed just off Time Square last time and would never do it again after staying in the Sheraton Tribeca 100% better quality and the staff actually acted like they care. RecommendationTry dining, we stopped in one evening and decided to eat down stairs. The restaurant was quiet and the service was really good from both the guys. The food was spot on, the rib eye steak was cooked to perfection and even me being a fussy eater enjoyed it. It was quite big as well. The Lamb dish was also very good. And the cost was the same as local bars only issue the meals could have come with a few more sides. 100% recommended.Bad PointsThe lack of beer in the bar on arrival. We got told a few different things and only two beers ended up on draught by the end of our week. The club lounge had no beer at all after our fifth day of being told no beer we got given a few beer vouchers. This meant going down to the bar and carrying the beer back up to the 21st floor. I was really disappointed with this and the solution provided by the hotel on the whole. Although the staff did their very best it was just not acceptable for a full week, I ended up drinking wine however it was not that nice. I'm sure management must have been aware of the issue and see no reason a few crates could not have picked up from the store. This was the most disappointing thing for me during our stay.","Preston, United Kingdom","Djmel1980</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston, United Kingdom</strong>",41,4.0

After a long travel and work day, I checked in at the Sheraton Tribeca around 6pm. I arrived in my room and was immediately taken back by the smell which was equivalent to my high school locker room after football practice on a hot summer day. I proceeded to put my stuff down and lay down on the bed where I got a quick 5-minute nap as sirens woke me up. As I turned over and pulled some of the sheets off I noticed a women’s hair pin in the bed and immediately threw it on the ground. As I was up at this point and disgusted by the conditions I proceeded to use the bathroom where I immediately noticed that the shower was dirty and there were rodent feces all around baseboards (picture attached). As I really had enough and didn’t feel comfortable in the room I called the front desk and had the following interaction with Christina: Q: Hi I’ve noticed that my room is not clean and I’m wondering if you could move me to a different room?A: We are all booked tonight. You can wait until tomorrow and then we can transfer you. Q: No that is ok. Would it be possible to have housekeeping come up and clean up some of these problem areas? A: No housekeeping has left for the day. You can wait until tomorrow to have it cleaned up. Q: I feel extremely uncomfortable in this room, could you please transfer me to another SPG hotel?A: No, we don’t transfer people. Q: I’m sorry, are you sure that you cannot transfer me to another hotel? I don’t feel comfortable and I’m not much to work with here. A: You can go ahead and book your own hotel if you do not want to stay here. We do not transfer people. At this point, I was in complete disbelief at the lack of customer service skills displayed by management and staff at the Sheraton Tribeca. I proceeded to call SPG Corporate where after explaining my situation they offered hotels with astronomically high prices even for New York City. SPG Corporate offered little choice and I had to stay in a hotel that was not in my desired area.

If my son was an older teen this might have been a reasonable option but in a strange city on one of New York's busiest and most chaotic streets, he did not feel happy about sleeping alone. Consequently we had to have those heavy adjoining fire doors constantly propped open by a chair and we never felt properly relaxed and of course we couldn't unpack. These rooms were not great, being right outside the lift. The next day we did some early sightseeing so that we could come back in the early afternoon to claim our new room. However, when we came back we were told that we were welcome to keep the extra room at no extra charge as there would not be a twin room available that day either. I really couldn't believe their casual attitude about all of this and how they didn't seem to appreciate how inconvenienced we felt about it. At my insistence I got complimentary access to their 'club' area which was a lounge on the top floor which was a very pleasant and stylish lounge with a 24/7 supply of drinks and snacks and spectacular views of New York from the terrace. However, only the next day did I finally get a twin room and what a sorry sight it was. It actually had a badly cracked basin in the bathroom, and when leaning over the sink to brush my teeth I had a close-up view of just how filthy the overflow hole was. One of the towels also had black staining on it - like mascara although it had been laundered so it really should have been de-commissioned. The desk chair had a revolting stain on it - nothing that upholstery cleaner wouldn't shift - but it just seemed typical of the lack of care or attention to detail. The beds were very comfortable so no complaints there. However, I was surprised and disappointed in a four star hotel that there was not even a little fridge anywhere to keep our drinks and fresh milk. There would have been space for this if a couple of shelves were taken out of their poor quality and unattractive brown furniture. So I wouldn't recommend this place - the staff did not treat us well and there are better hotels out there for the price.","Oxford, United Kingdom","AMSpalding</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",41,2.0

Now, the hotel itself--if the staff hadn't been very nice and the beds hadn't been very comfortable, I would have given it only 1 star! The rooms are very small and very cheaply appointed--for example, the headboard I think was supposed to look like leather but it was a very bad fake and was plastic as was the wall paper. The bathrooms are also too small with no space to put your toiletries. The closet was tiny and looked like the closets they have in a college dorm! One more thing--we usually had to wait at least 5 minutes for the lift as there were 3 lifts but 1 was out of order, which apparently is the case all the time.

From the moment you walk in the door the bellmen are right there for you, in any of our past stays have we ever had to wait, they are on it. I really wish that I could remember their names but I am much better with faces then name tags! They all have made a definite impression on us though! Will the Front Desk Manager is a wonderful asset to not only this hotel but to the Sheraton Corporation! The Conceiarge Level is wonderful! They really put out a nice spread for appetites of all kinds. The view from the top patio is phenomenal! We look foreword to spending much time up there this summer with our family!! The rooms are nice! You can never go wrong with a think Sheraton bed. The rooms are nicely updated and have many extra touches to make use of all of the space in a New York size room :) Which exist at any hotel you go to in any big city! What I feel is an added bonus is that there is a fine dining restaurant located inside the hotel. There is also a wonderful deli (24 hour) located right next door. There is a Pizza Parlor on the corner about a half a block away. At this property you are walking distance to the underground subway, Canal St & Little Italy. You really can’t go wrong with this property. I hope that you felt my review to be helpful to you. We really look foreword to coming back in the very near future!","Chicago, Illinois","CassyCole13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",0,5.0

The hotel is clean, professionally run and friendly from the moment you arrive until the time you depart. It is certainly a hotel you are pleased you chose - specific mention to Sai and his bellboy colleague who provided an exceptional level of profesisonal service and a smile at all times of the day.The room is not spacious but where is in NY.

My Platinum status gave me more benefits at this hotel. The hotel was also very thoughtful about which type of room I might prefer. The Club Lounge was small but it has a fabulous and spacious patio on the 21st floor.My room was large (uncommon in NYC) and I used the fitness center every morning. I am in NYC frequently for work and had been trending on staying in a different hotel each time. After this stay it is highly likely that I will try to book here for all future stays in NYC because I had a very special room that I will not divulge here since there aren't many of them. I also could have walked to/from all of my meetings in Lower Manhattan had it not been raining.The hotel is super close to the 1, A, C, E, and the 6 subway lines all along Canal so it is very easy to transfer underground from Penn Station. The location also is easy to get to via the Brooklyn or Manhattan Bridges if coming into LGA or JFK airports via Queens/Brooklyn.I spend on average half of every year in hotels for work and I very highly recommend this hotel.

The rooms are pretty standard for NYC - nothing to write home about but certainly comfortable enough for a week long stay. The staff are friendly and remember you throughout your trip. I am a Starwood member so I usually opt for the high floors on the club levels. This is great as it includes afternoon happy hour in the clubroom as well as free breakfasts. The bfasts are above average for hotels in my opinion - just enough to get you through to lunch. The only downside of this hotel is its right on Canal St so definitely opt for a room facing away from canal.

It was all great until we tried to place an order for room service breakfast the next morning. We followed the directions on the card that was given to us and hung it on our door for them to take. We requested a delivery between 10:15-10:30am. Woke up the next morning and no breakfast. Checked the door and the card was taken, so they must have received the order. We called to inquire about what happened and to cancel the breakfast since we had made plans that we needed to get to. Spoke to a gentleman who said he would get back to me about what happened and we never heard back from him. So that was very disappointing. While we were getting ready to leave for the day, housekeeping came by our room. We simply told them we were leaving shortly and to come back in a half hour and they said no problem. On our way out, we even spoke with the front desk and told them housekeeping stopped by and we want to be sure our room gets cleaned and she said she would notify them now. So, we came back well after five hours to our room not cleaned. We went down to the front desk and the man told us they were ""backed up and he'll check on it for us"" he also thought we had our DND sign on the door, but we never used it. Nothing ever happened, there was no follow through, so we gave up and had to request a whole set of things for the room (towels, soaps, shampoo, toilet paper, coffee, etc) and the woman rushed me off the phone so quickly and forgot half of the items we requested.

But during my stay the room was absolutely filthy and some of the towels were torn and stained. I don't expect a large or fancy room (this is not the W) but don't expect it to be dirty. In addition the wifi did not work and never rectified. Ended up having to use international roaming to send work emails that could not wait. Housekeeping did not provide turndown service one day after I called to make sure it would be done in the morning. When I called the manager with these issues he said he would email me with a detailed reply and offer points as compensation. Neither happened. I also had an important package being delivered to me which the hotel said they never received. then later said the person did not give them my last name so they couldn't locate me.

The scrambled eggs were atrocious. They need to fix that. But the few from the Club Room (top floor) was gorgeous, especially on a bright summer day. They also have a Planet Fitness gym adjacent to the hotel that is open 24 hours during the weekdays. I believe the fee is $10 for a monthly membership and is a perfect option in case you need to burn off those calories from all the delicious food you'll be eating.Great place to stay if you are flying to/from Newark Airport. It's about 3-5 minutes away from the Holland Tunnel and prevents you from having to cut through the city to get there. This is a huge relief after a long flight!","Seattle, Washington","NWTraveler25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",32,4.0

I stayed on the eleventh floor and had no difficulty sleeping.I had breakfast in the hotel once purely for convenience, it's adequate, unremarkable and I thought a little expensive. I recommend visiting local bubbys, which is also a little expensive but well worth the visit. Finally, be wary and pay close attention to your hotel billing on your departure. I was mistakenly charged a bar bill. This was acknowledged and corrected on my departure, or so I thought.On return to the U.K. I noticed my credit card was still debited for the bar bill.

We did not use their valet parking - it would have cost us $150 to valet our SUV for 48 hours. We parked it on our own close by & it was $125 for 48 hours. When we arrived 90 minutes before check in time we were told our room was clean but it hadn't been released by housekeeping. No problem - we checked our bags and went out & explored. The room was small as most NYC hotel rooms are. It was clean. The previous occupant left a suit hanging in the wardrobe. We gave the suit to the maid in the hallway and she didn't seem to know what to do with it. The first problem encountered was the shower stall. In order to reach the shower knobs, you have to get into the shower & the first cold blast of water lands right on you. Then you have to back up & stand against the back wall while it warms up so only your feet are exposed to the cold water until warm water comes out. The next problem were the bed pillows - they were all super soft and feathery & didn't support your head or neck at all. My husband went without a pillow - I took the throw pillow off the chair and wrapped in it a towel & used that. Throughout the night we discovered these rooms have zero sound proofing. We were by the elevator & heard every person (most of them loud since it was after midnight) who was coming back for the night. Some decided they needed to use the ice maker after midnight which was also across from our room & very loud. The next day we went out from 8:30-10:00am & 11:00am-2:30pm. Housekeeping did not clean our room during this time. I took two clean towels off the cart in the hallway so we could shower for the wedding. We took a nap to make up for the bad night's sleep the night before & then got ready. As we were leaving at 5:30pm we went to the front desk and told them that our room was not cleaned by housekeeping today and we would like it to be serviced now. The man at the front desk did not seem to care so it wasn't a surprise when we got back at midnight & it was still dirty. My husband called down for clean towels for the morning & they did bring them up right away. At 5am I was awoken by 3 people who decided to sit on the floor near the ice maker and have a conversation at full volume. Finally after 20 minutes - I opened the door and asked them to please take their conversation elsewhere. I was more than happy to leave this hotel on Sunday morning. I've been to other Starwood properties in Manhattan that were great so we will not be going back to this one. On Monday morning I got an updated folio for our stay. They added a $4 water charge to the bill. The Evian water was $4 and we did not touch it. The Dasani was complimentary & we did drink that. I called them & they did remove the $4 charge from our bill.","Newburyport, Massachusetts","EagleAction</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newburyport, Massachusetts</strong>",14,2.0

The staff was nice and attentive to our needs, and even held on to my daughters little doll that she accidentally left on the elevator. Next door is a little deli/shop where you can buy light snacks and drinks if you didn't have access to the club room.One of the best features, IMO, is the location. We walked just a few blocks with the kids and discovered we were right next to Chinatown and Little Italy. There are so many little shops and restaurants to discover, it would take us weeks to check out all of them. If you decide to try and grab a cab at the main entrance, forget about it, the traffic is terrible on that street and it is one way. Walk 2 blocks to 6th and grab one there.

The hotel is in very good condition and is very well maintained. Despite being a high traffic property it is still not showing wear and tear in my experience. I use this hotel for both business and personal stays in NY. There are multiple subways that are very close so it's easy to get anywhere. The location is awesome if you like a more neighborhood feel, lots of shopping and dining nearby. I much prefer being down here to midtown which feels very generic and touristy compared to SoHo/Tribeca.My experience with the staff has always been terrific, particularly the front desk. In particular Sal is awesome and remembers me by name. You have to care quite a bit to pull that off, especially when it might be a couple months since I've been in and this is a busy hotel. Also, Katie on the Guest Relations team has been very proactive and helpful in reaching out to get feedback and help with any questions and requests. Again, she obviously cares quite a bit. I feel bad I don't remember all the names of the other great folks, it's not because they don't offer great service as well.SPG recognition is the best I've experienced in NYC as well. I've been to just about every property in midtown (all brands) and this hotel is consistently the best with upgrades and amenities.Finally, I usually find this hotel to be very reasonably priced compared to the other SPG properties in town. Some tips:1. The club lounge is awesome. Good service, food selection, extra snacks during the day and one of the best views in the whole city and an amazing roof deck. If there weather is nice you don't even need to go out, hang out and have drinks on the roof deck.2. Peppolino for Italian right around the corner is terrific. 3. Nancy Whiskey is a great dive bar with good burgers right around the corner4. The gym is decent but there is also a Planet Fitness connected5. Canal St is very busy, sometimes it's easier to have your Uber/Lyft/Car meet you across the street or around the corner6. Like many NYC hotels, the rooms can be small. If you are with others, spring for the larger rooms, the difference is worth itThis will continue to be my go to spot in NYC when the price is right!","chicago, il","Dan G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>chicago, il</strong>",35,5.0

At the Sheraton Tribeca, the problems were not small, forcing us to scramble the day after we arrived to secure alternate accommodations. What was wrong? Her is a BRIEF list of a few selected issues that made our continued stay impossible:Except for the bed, the comfort of the accommodations, as a whole, was unacceptable -- 1. The deadbolt did not work on the door to our room when we arrived, and to the room to which we were moved on Day 2; 2. The gym was immediately below our $300+/day room, and the treadmill noise -- thumpa, thumpa, thumpa, thumpa -- woke me at 7:00 am and continued non-stop for an hour before I finally gave up after only 3 1/2 hours of sleep); 3. NO SHELF/DRAWER SPACE IN THE ENTIRE ROOM, SO WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE OUT OF OUR SUITCASES FOR 2 DAYS BEFORE WE MOVED OUT; 4. terrible night staff attitude and service (day staff much better and accommodating); 5. view of pipes and brick wall outside both of the rooms to which we were assigned, AND THESE WERE SUPPOSEDLY THE BEST ROOMS IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL!!!; 6.

The Sheraton TriBeCa is on Canal, nestled in between takeaway shops and closed shops. The subway connections are good and it's a short walk to Soho and Downtown but on an evening there are questionable characters lurking outside and the atmosphere can be uncomfortable. I didn't have a great arrival or start to my stay here, problems with the room rate I booked, a dirty room and argumentative manager. Eventually all was resolved, I was given a different room, given the correct room rate and promised points for my troubles; the female manager didn't get why I was frustrated and didn't come back to me to follow up. The problem with this property is that it's dated, never particularly feels fully clean and the club lounge and lobby bar are always incredibly crowded; it makes relaxing anywhere but your room difficult. There is a Starbucks concession in the lobby which is an added bonus. The rooms here do need updating and the furnishings do need replacing. The rate here is not cheap compared to other hotels in the area and hence the value for money is questionable. The TV's are terrible but the wifi is good. The service, in general, was good. Reception team were friendly and the bell boy and concierge was also welcoming and helpful. The night manager was good; he tried to resolve the issues I'd faced on arrival. Room service was always good and quick.I think more attention needs to be paid to housekeeping here and with ensuring SPG benefits are delivered consistently. This could be a great hotel instead of a good hotel if standards were improved. I am still waiting a response from the hotel as to why my rate changed before my arrival and why I was downgraded.

The breakfast was good and the happy hour with appetizers was great. We had a 3 yr old with stroller and we walked all over Soho, Tribeca, Chinatown, Little Italy. It's a great location.

You usually have to choose between location and cost, and getting both is pretty rare. NYC has a good number of hip boutique hotels that spawl across Tribeca and Soho, but these usually come upwards of £300 per night. If you are like me, it's great to stay in cool and hip hotel, but a great location and price that isn't going cripple me is more important.The Sheraton Tribeca is located on Canal Street, a busy road linking the Holland Tunnel and Manhattan bridge and splits the Tribeca and Lower Manhattan neighbourhoods. At first glance you feel like the hotel is sandwiched between two busy lanes of traffic, which it is, however you are also positioned within 15 minutes walk from some of the nicest places to eat and drink in Manhattan. A Metro stop is around the corner so you can reach the heights of Central Park and Times Square easily, however if you want to sightsee around either of these locations then I wouldn't stay here and instead opt for somewhere further north.Walking out of the door of the hotel to the north is the delights of Soho and Greenwich, with the Meat Packing district about 30 minutes walk. Bleekers Street, famous for eateries and live music is 15 minutes away. 15 minutes to the east is Little Italy and Chinatown, and 15 minutes to the south is the WTC.Inside the hotel the rooms are of average size, a little dated, but clean and comfy enough. The sound proofing isn't great as the doors don't really keep the noise out, however the beds are very comfortable which makes sleeping after a long day of walking the streets nice and easy. All in all if you are looking for a good location then The Sheraton Tribeca ticks the boxes especially if you are a foodie and live music junky. Don't expect boutique decor and long velvet curtains or you will be disappointed.Transfers to JFK are 1.15hr and Newark approx 1hr.",,Stuart A,3,3.0

I stayed 5 nights and I had to finally ask for them to vacuum my room and clean my desk and my sink. Plus the housekeepers bang the doors of whatever room they are cleaning 10 or 15 times. I do not understand why they can't stick a towel in the door but instead they let it slam shut each time they go out to their cart. It woke us up early every morning and then in the late afternoon when I would try to rest before going out to dinner, bang bang bang all over again.

The check-in was okay, however I got to point out that the female front desk greeted us inappropriately with a ""hand"" gesture asking us to come over and we were only 2 feet away??? No ""good afternoon"" or ""hello""? I should have said something but was caught off guard and quite surprised with the unprofessionalism that I was speechless.We had access to the club lounge which was not bad, they had specials from 5:30-8:30pm serving wine, salad and light snacks. The only turn off was the ""tip jar"" and the server was being a little over the top at times speaking loudly. Again, it shows unprofessionalism and looks cheap for an establishment like this. It was self service for club members, the tip jar shouldn't be there. I left one of my favorite belongings accidentally at my club level room. I didn't realized it until I checked out and reached home. I called the housekeeping manager and left her two messages on a Sunday and Monday, and she never return my calls. I called the front desk and the associate was very understanding and contacted the person who inspected the room. She called me several hours later and said he didn't see anything. She suggested me to call housekeeping again the next morning but again no one picks up the phone. She asked me to contact guest relations manager if I can't get a hold of housekeeping but I got a voicemail. I left a voicemail for the manager to call me back and she never did. After 5 hours later, I called front desk again and I got to speak to the same associate who assisted me and she said she personally went to the housekeeping manager and told her the issue, and they looked through the lost and found again but couldn't locate my belongings. She said that there is nothing else they can do unless the cleaner found it and give it to them. So I said the cleaner stole it then? She says most likely it was. But because I left it there, it was difficult to ask it back from the cleaner?? At this point, I gave up!! Credit is given to the front desk associate for helping me but the problem was not solved. They knew who cleaned my room and it was easy to confront that thieve to give me back my belongings. But they didn't! The managers at this hotel are good for nothing, afraid to talk to their guests about an issue that occurred and let their associate deal with it.

I reserved a Club Level room for one night. Upon arrival I noticed the rust in the bathroom both on a shelf fixture and the shower curtain rod. The walls were scuffed, the carpet old and there were no luggage racks. I did not complain that night and decided it was one night and to just deal with it. The following morning I needed to iron some clothing and was appalled by the stained ironing board. I was hesitant to put a piece of white clothing on the board. After showering with poor drainage in the tub and standing in ankle deep water, I called guest services. I asked for a manager to please come to my room as I did not feel the room was Club Level room quality and hopefully not even what I thought Sheraton standards were for a regular room. I stated I would like a manager to see the room and I wanted to point out the issues. I really felt management would take one look at the rust and ironing board and be appalled. The employee asked if I wanted to change rooms. I responded I was checking out that day. She told me she would tell the manager my concerns ""when she comes to work"" - no manager on duty? On a Saturday morning? Then she hung up! I was in the hotel for several more hours but did not hear from anyone.When I checked out I was asked if everything was satisfactory. I again listed my concerns. The clerk told me she put 1,000 points on my account and acted as if that should satisfy me. I showed her a few pics I had taken and she just shook her head.

But it's not the only problem we faced. Upon clients departure, the hotel has not provided the receipts of the guests stay (everything has been prepaid but no proof of payment has been sent to me) AND on the top of that, an extra amount has been withdrawn from our company's credit card without any justification.

The top floor Club Lounge has fantastic views over lower Manhattan and the two rivers.Nevertheless, without doubt this was the worst Starwood stay (indeed, probably the worst stay anywhere) that I have experienced in over thirty years of travelling.The organisation and delivery of housekeeping services is this hotel’s greatest problem.On two of the four days we were there, housekeeping passed us by and phone calls to Guest Services (on both occasions!) resulted in accusations of the Do Not Disturb sign being left on the door- it wasn’t: there was a strong sense that Guest Services pushed back and blamed the guest for any issue that was brought to their attention. Servicing eventually happened, though we never managed to get any Shower Gel left in the room, or Non-Decaf coffee bags for the coffee maker, either. Add to this a bathtub that needed an engineer in order to drain, and air conditioning only part-functioning throughout the first night and you’ll get a sense of some of our frustrations. The magnetic-stripe room keys are clearly past their best; both of ours needed recoding on practically a daily basis - and yes, of course we weren't keeping them near phones or clasps.The greatest single error, though, resulted from only half of our laundry order being returned. Eventually the hotel accepted responsibility for this, but only after blatantly accusing one of us of telling lies. When “Perhaps you’re mistaken and you never gave it in” was rebutted with the promise one of us had taken a photo of the order form, duly dated that morning, the - very rude and abrupt - Guest Services handler stressed “We have checked the cameras and can see the floorman delivering all your laundry to your room, so you must be wrong and it’s in there!” Those were her exact words. Only after the point was made that, if she could indeed see two pairs of clean gents’ trousers going IN the room, she would certainly see them going OUT as well, did she backtrack and say- actually- she couldn’t tell what the laundry was after all.Staff on the front desk, meanwhile, were always understanding and accommodating, doing their best to solve all issues. We left without half our clothing but with a complimentary car to the airport and promises that our missing garments will be sent on to us as soon as they turn up. Time will tell… we’ll keep you informed of any developments, though we’re not holding our breath.So, if you’re looking for a well located hotel; you’re not too bothered about other services; and you value the Club Lounge view and can afford it or are certain to be given it then certainly consider the Sheraton TriBeCa. If not we suggest you can find much better elsewhere. ","London, United Kingdom","harrysmall</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,2.0

I usually come on review sites like this and think ""wow that person is high maintenance there is no way it can be that bad"". But here I am. To start, the lady at the front desk was giving us a very hard time at check in because of our Canadian credit card. (We can't be the first Canadian couple to stay here). Next, all over the site there are pictures of a rooftop patio, when I requested access from the same lady she said I needed to pay an extra $30 to get up there, I offered to pay cash, debit or credit and she said it wasn't doable because of my room type. The amenities were bad, the location is sketchy and loud and when checking out the manager scoffed at me for having ordered 2 robes and calamari to the room for my wife's birthday. Moved to the Ace Hotel for not much more per night and it feels like absolute heaven. Don't be like me and take the cheap option!

Here are the details...1. I called before booking the room to get details about the room placement, what the inside looked like, layout, etc - you name it, I asked (yes, I'm a bit OCD). Colin is the one who answered. After over 30 min of all of these questions, he was never annoyed. This alone made me want to book the room.2. So I booked my room, and got upgraded! But before we go there, please let me elaborate on the customer service here. When I walked in, I literally felt like I was greeted as though I were I celebrity. Everything was extremely kind; you could tell that they loved their job. The staff wanted to make sure that any of my questions/concerns were addressed. I cannot stress enough how pleasant this staff was.3. I walked into my room on the 21st floor, with gorgeous views, a lovely welcome gift, and access to the club lounge, which serves food for breakfast and happy hours. The view from the outdoors access of the lounge is just so awesome (rooftop). My room was super clean and spacious, which was great since I was staying there for a week, prior to a 2-week Europe trip.4. Location cannot be beat. It's right in Tribeca/SoHo. A bunch of great restaurants (really good Italian one around the corner), and quick access to the train (got me to my BK Dumbo office in 16 min).I was seriously speechless at the quality of customer service before, during, and after. And this, coming from someone who has literally traveled the world (Asia and all over Europe, Caribbean, French Polynesia, etc), and stayed at multiple five-star resorts... I'll tell you this: the customer service here was as good (in some case better) than some of the 5-star resorts at which I have stayed.

It was pre-booked through corporate for a conference and prior to flying in I tried to get it switched to no avail. My gut was right. Upon checking in the first room we went into still had candy/cookie wrappers and crumbs left in it on the nightstand from the prior guests. We moved a room down the hall that was ""clean"" and the sink stopper wouldn't open. So at about 3pm we called down and requested an engineer to fix it. Went to the gym and came back at about 7pm to find it untouched. Called down again to let them know no one came and got ready and went out to dinner. Came home at about 11pm to find it was still not fixed. Called again and they said they would send someone in the morning. Mind you this whole time we weren't able to wash our hands or brush teeth etc. in our room because the sink wouldn't drain at all!! Luckily we were able to shower and use our gyms bathrooms that evening... Finally the next morning at 7am we call the *FOURTH* time to get someone to fix the sink. They said ""they would *try* to find the engineer"". What does that mean??! Engineer rolls in at 745am and doesn't have it fixed by 8:10am. Asked him to step out so I could shower before my meeting and he said he would be back at 830am. He uses our room towels to semi dry the floor leaving brown water and gunk everywhere. 9:15am and still not back so we left for the morning. Literally have to call a fifth time on day two for them to get it fixed and cleaned. On top of all this obvious stuff, the room was dated and dark. Small as can be expected in NYC, but also filthy.

We didn't, and massively regretted chosing this hotel for a miserable 5 night stay. This hotel is nowhere near 4 stars by any stretch of the imagination. If you are a one night stay businessman then fine, if you're a holidaymaker, go elsewhere.The receptionists are very nice and polite. As are other staff we encountered.The room was very small even though we booked a ""delux"" (HA!!!) king. The room was terrible. The carpet was brown and covered in dark stains. The bedding was old, had holes in and the pillows were disgusting. Even the curtain was stained!! We'd slept really well in our hotel off Times Square and this was a real come down, we didn't sleep properly at all and it spoiled the end of our holiday.The bathroom was ridiculously small, and was smaller than just the shower we'd had in the hotel off times square. No space whatsoever. It was dirty and old fashioned. The sink plug didn't work. There was no bath plug. The towels were old, ripped, all different and stained.The desk chair seat wasn't attached to the chair. The tv was a joke, we had no signal on about 50% of the channels so couldn't watch anything. Our room overlooked Canal Street, which seemed to be the busiest street in NYC, 24/7. There was a traffic jam the first day we arrived and cars honked none stop until gone 3am. It doesn't matter how high up the hotel you are, you'll hear it.Housekeeping were a joke. They took towels away but didn't replace them. Didn't bother coming in some days. Never replaced anything we'd used in the room, just made the bed. I had to ask at reception for some new towels and some toilet paper!!!!When other guests on our floor had room service, they left their dirty plates outside their rooms. And there they stayed for 24hours. Even after I mentioned it to reception, they didn't get moved. The day after it was more plates, glasses and pizza boxes. Then we had the treat of coming back to two full trash bags left outside our bedroom door!!I'd spent a long time researching hotels for our holiday and feel like I made a massive mistake staying here as we couldn't wait to leave.

I will list the problems below.1) I asked a travel agency to book my hotel, as I am used to do. When I got here, the receptionist told me that I would not be able to get my points in SPG( Fidelity card) because I have not booked thru the SPG website. It is a surprise to me- and not a good one- because I am paying in the same way and the other times the same travel agency booked the hotel to me and I have received my points as usual. 2) I will have to leave one night before. It means I have planned to leave on Sunday, but I will have to leave tomorrow ( Saturday). Expedia, who booked the hotel, said Sheraton will charge the Saturday night fee anyway. It is an absurd, because I haven't canceled my reservation! I just need to leave one day before. 3) concierge: I was trying to get info about plays/ theaters in the city. I could not find anyone at the Concierge. I left a note and asked to leave the information in my room. Didn't have a feedback. Then, I finally met someone there and asked to check the cheapest price to watch Aladdin. She called me a couple of hours later and said it was 299 dollars. I decided then to go to the theater after work to check it. I got a ticket for 80 dollars and it was in intermediary place, because the cheapest price was 50 dollars!! I think it is really complicated since it is a touristic city and the hotel should offer a better service and support to the client. Again: I am really disappointed!4) yesterday I arrived from work after a long day and there were no hot water in the shower!!! How can a 4 stars hotel have this kind of problem and don't offer any feedback to the client? I called at the reception and the girl told me it was a problem and they didn't have idea at what time they would fix it!! I am sorry, but I am sick ( strong cold!) and needed to have a cold shower in a hotel 4 stars? You have to agree with me that it is terrible! And the girl said I would be compensate for this problem. Until now, I have not received nothing! Neither an apologize call. - Toodles bed dirty. How can it be possible?- Hotel is not in a good location/ neighborhood. ",,Roberta P,0,2.0

It was a bit hard to find at first using our Google directions as we went passed the hotel (scaffolding in the front). Just went around a few blocks and pulled up in front while we checked in. Used valet parking and the guys were great. Even better? The front desk especially Sal. I am used to NYC being filled with rude, brisk people and everyone at the Sheraton was the complete opposite. We are platinum and we were thanked for our business and loyalty to Starwood. Booked two rooms and received club access. There was a slight snafu with one of the rooms not having two beds so Sal gave us a certificate good for two drinks at the bar (""where the hard stuff is that the Club Lounge doesn't serve""). Rooms were small but that is very typical of New York. Since we were there only one night, it was fine. I did notice that my husband's and my bathroom door was different than the one my son and his friend occupied. I did hear a some noise all night long from Canal Street though we were on a high floor so I put the ear plugs in. The club lounge patio was large and offered a lot of seating and great views. Of course, during the peak happy hour time, one woman was stretched out on a sofa using it as her personal tanning bed. Most people had a drink and then left. Did I mention that the food as well as beer, wine and soft drinks, bottled water etc. were complimentary.Location was great to get to an event in Times Square via the subway. We also walked easily down to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. We also had great pizza by the slice just outside the Sheraton to the left on the corner across the street. Cheap and quick. The club lounge host recommended. Also, immediately to the left out the front door is a little grocery/market/convenience store that sells beer, some wine and sandwiches etc. Cheaper prices than the convenient stores closer to the subway.Honestly, this was such a great stay, I wish we could have been there longer than one night.

Let's start with the good. The location is excellent. Tribeca is a nice neighborhood and you are essentially on the border of wonderful Soho and very near the West Village. So location wise, this place is really great. It's a given that NYC hotels are really expensive especially with respect to value. My room was the cheapest I could book on their site and it was roomy enough for one person. Might have been a little tight with two people but would have been manageable. Just not a lot of space around the bed for walking around the room. My shower was very modern and nice and the bathroom was just fine. I also felt the front desk women I dealt with were very sweet and accommodating. I did not check out the gym as I was going to get a lot of fitness in during my trip via walking the streets of the city.The first floor offers things like a mini cafe, an Italian restaurant, and a full bar. I also seemed to notice a business center for internet, etc. Okay, so that's all well and good. Let's talk about the things I did not like First off, what is up with bathroom door having a rather large split down the middle of it when closed? Who thought this was a good idea. Essentially, if you really wanted to, you could look into an occupied bathroom if someone was in it and had the door closed. Really weird and gross. I've attached a photo in my review so you can see what I mean. Also, the flushing mechanism on the toilet is annoying and confusing. One, it's not a handle. You need to reach directly behind you and push a button. Second, the button is essentially two buttons in one that can be pressed individually or both at the same time. I can assume what is supposed to be pushed for when but again, how about a simple handle on the side of the toilet? Perhaps the idea here is that they won't break off as easily? Regardless I find it puzzling and it's in a bad location on the toilet. (I've attached a photo to show you what I mean.)The immediate interior is also no good at this hotel. As soon as you walk in you see a huge pillar that essentially takes up prime real estate at the check in desk. There simply isn't too much space in the immediate front area of this hotel because of this damn pillar. I imagine this hotel is a mess during long lines for checkout in the morning, etc. You should consider the Hilton Garden Inn. Roughly the same price as this hotel and very close by. I would probably stay there next time just to compare. Hilton Garden Inn has a nicer restaurant in the hotel which you can tell just from the photos online. Overall, yes, I recommend this hotel. Great location, friendly staff, solid price. But I wouldn't call it anything more than solid. P.S. The pillows were way too soft and not comfy. Would have appreciated something firmer.","Los Angeles, California","C27111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,3.0

He reviewed the video and entry to our room. He confirmed that over the day housekeeping had been in 3 times. THREE. Using 2 different keys. Two of these times were while we were at dinner. He reviewed the surveillance video and only saw them leaving with bags of towels and sheets... as if they couldn't have hid it inside. He bought himself time by saying he would chat with the maid the following day (at this point it was 1:30AM and we have a flight to catch the next day). We waited around all morning for him to confront the mail... hadn't heard anything... we eventually touched base with Colin when he said he would **maybe** file an insurance claim if we had the receipts. We gathered our information and went back to chat. At that time, he came off as insulting and patronizing. Basically said ""sorry you can't prove it"" and dismissed our claim. He said he would file a claim with the insurance- but we got the feeling nothing was going to come from this. He completely knew we had to catch a flight back to Canada and took complete advantage that we were powerless and didn't have time to file a police report. End of the day, we have no confirmation of any insurance claim being filed by Colin, a half apology and hours wasted trying to convince this man of our story.

The beds were really nice and comfortable however there was no bar fridge in the room which made it a bit difficult, and no microwave (however not so common!) and the rooms are quite small. Housekeeping did do a good job at cleaning the rooms every day. Luckily I requested a room on a higher level, as being on level 4 and facing canal street it is very noisy. I moved from level 4 to level 8, and on the opposite side from the busy canal street. Initially at the desk one of the ladies said no to me moving rooms, however I rang reservations when I was in the room spoke to another lady who helped fix it up (it always helps to ask!!).

Room was a decent size, clean and one of the most comfortable beds (& pillows) I've had in a hotel!!!The staff were really friendly and helpful.There is a nice bar and internet & printing facilities in reception.We upgraded to club level (after I'd asked) - 2 options were offered, either upgrade for access to the club lounge and sun terrace with breakfast/snacks only or a full upgrade to a club level room (including access to the lounge & sun terrace, breakfast and evening snacks & drinks). I would recommend asking about the upgrade option as the room we had was on the 19th floor with good views over the river and Canal Street and also high enough to not be bothered by street/traffic noise. The evening snacks included various dips, cold cuts, cheeses and biscuits but, best of all, wine & beer!!! Breakfast was a selection of breads (mainly different types of bagels), cereals, sausages, scrambled eggs, juices, tea/coffee. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are available 24hrs (for club level).The room was a good size and clean with decent facilities. Club level includes free WiFi access which was pretty good too.Hotel location is great - Chinatown & Little Italy are nearby, a 15 minute walk to Greenwich Avenue for some more bars & restaurants. A 10-15 minute walk to WTC. Canal Street subway is a couple of minutes' walk away to go uptown for shopping.

One of the best city views on their patio outside. You can enjoy your food or drinks outside. In the morning they have cereal, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, waffles, bagels, fruit, yogurt and toast. Nice little perk and probably saved our family of 4 easily $30+for breakfast. They also have a happy hour at 530. Fruit, cheeses and snacks were available in the evening.

He had us checked-in within minutes and the room we received was beyond our expectations. We then needed assistance with scheduling our weekend plans, and Sass (the concierge representative) got us 3 amazing reservations. Sass took into consideration exactly what we were looking for and she delivered beyond what we could have ever expected. These reservations showcased how amazing New York City really is. Corey and Sal (both at the front desk), provided us with great recommendations for sight seeing that we took him up on and we were completely pleased with. Deon (at the Club Level Lounge), was extremely attentive and professional, it really showcases how well Sheraton Hotels train their staff. We watched first hand how Deon served a room of more than 60 people, with ease and contributing such a fun atmosphere for us on our vacation. Thank you Sheraton Tribeca for a wonderful holiday that allowed us to reconnect, enjoy great food and see what New York City has to offer.Our room was perfect and quiet, spacious and clean and exactly what we wanted and more. Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better experience with the staff.

Asked for the room to be changed which was done almost immediately. Now what were the chances of me find a bathroom with tiny strands of hair in a corner of the loo again? Slim I guess, but I saw them close to the door of the shower area. Ignored it as we were after a long journey. Before going out later that evening (5pm), we realised that the locker in the cupboard was not working. Told the person at the reception, said we'll send someone but nothing had been done when we got back past 10pm.The sleep quality that night was extremely poor, which went through all three nights. It was a big king size bed, but it really sagged. As my partner is heavier than me, I was basically sleeping at an incline! This really ruined my stay at the hotel as one wants to feel rested to explore a new city.As we were really tired the first night, we put the do no disturb sign outside our room - didn't want room service knocking at 10am. However, we did end up leaving our room by 11:30 am for the day when we removed the sign. The house keeping was visible across the corridor as they are in any hotel at the time. We also reminded the reception about our locker still not working.We come back around 8:30pm after a long day to realise that our room has still not been done and neither has the locker / safe been fixed. Go to reception and tell them and after we told them what time we left and removed the sign this guy says (and this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard and the man saying it jolly well knew he's talking trash!) ""the problem is you removed the sign too late, but which time house keeping has already done a round to check which rooms need cleaning and which don't. If you need cleaning your room, the sign should be removed between 8am and 9am in the morning"". That's ridiculous because it negates the purpose of a sign, if you really have to put an alarm to put that sign back on!! He followed to say the staff leaves by six so no one can do anything now, but agreed to send someone for fresh towels and to make the bed. Absolutely unpleasant experience. The next day we reminded them again about the locker / safe which was finally done by the time we went back that evening.Overall that interaction with the staff was not nice, the room cleanliness levels were average, not something to expect from a Sheraton and worst of all was the sinking bed which really left me begging for a good night's sleep.Would not recommend.",,mnk1110,5,3.0

Despite being a decidedly tourist hotel, I stay at this Sheraton for many little things, and for two major reasons. One - the hotel gym is one that 'locals belong to' - meaning, it's no afterthought, converted hotel room. There are several treadmills, bikes, cross trainers, in addition to a full weight room and one set aside for 'floor work' (stretching etc) that's a bit out of the way. Two - Muhammed in the Concierge Lounge on weekdays consistently has a cheerful smile. Not just for me - I've just 'celebrated' my 51st stay - but for everyone I see him interact with.

I didn't get the bartender's name, but he did a great job and kept the place running smoothly.*My room on the 18th floor was quiet -- especially appreciated after my previous noisy hotel. It was very clean but small. I had a corner room with a queen bed, and it would have been tight with two people, with not much room for storage. It would have been fine for a couple of nights for two. It was perfect for just me. I also appreciated having an a/c that worked. The room overall was very comfortable.*I didn't spend much time in Chinatown, but walked over to the LES Tenement Museum and Russ & Daughters Cafe.

So I used it! This Sheraton is really on the very outside edge of Tribeca. It's really in Chinatown, although that's not nearly as sexy. Still, the location is truly convenient.I was on the 12th floor this time, in a connecting king room, and it was much larger than I remembered my last room. This time, the closet was actually useful. There was enough space for an armchair, and the room actually felt spacious for one person, maybe even two for a short stay. The bathroom was especially large for NYC, with lots of counter space and little bits of storage. I wish the lighting were brighter in the bathroom, but it's a minor complaint. My room came with club lounge access, so I had breakfast in the lounge, which was a hot mess. It was way overcrowded on a Sunday morning at 10AM. There were 2 staff members who did all they could to manage the overflow of people, and I appreciated that. The crowd Sunday morning was a weird mix of tourists and frequent SPG guests - I wished for a little bit more peace and quiet. The breakfast itself was decent. There were scrambled eggs and sausages for hot items (though in tiny containers that were quickly emptied). The best items were the pastries. I didn't think I would like the croissants and apple tartlets, but I ended up having two of each!I still have an issue with the front desk. I had to wait both for checking in and out. It always seems like a mess, which is disappointing. Also when I checked in, I was not told about club lounge access. That was confirmed when I called down to see what time breakfast was.

They got me on an upper floor so it was relatively quiet so I could get a nap in. The room size is enough for one person (knowing how small rooms in NYC are) so that's good. However, the reason I didn't go to four stars is a couple things: the sink was leaking a bit, and the housekeeping was not complete -- dirty glasses left behind and not replaced, only replaced one towel vs. three that I started with for some reason. Just seemed like a rushed job. Next, room service -- while the food tasted good, the delivery was a little messy: left out a water bottle I ordered and didn't take it off the bill, and when calling, the person taking the call didn't understand simple requests and required someone else to get on the phone to complete the order.","Seattle, Washington","JohnThomas84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",29,3.0

Well, in researching hotels for a long weekend trip, I came across a good price deal for the Sheraton Tribeca - around $110 a night which is very good for New York. I had never seen the hotel and was concerned that it might be one of those small-roomed deals with a view of the neighboring air shaft. But imagine my surprise – and pleasure - when I found that the Sheraton sported a bright, nicely done lobby, a fairly large room (certainly by NYC standards) that was spotless, beautifully decorated, had all the amenities you could want and (while this might not be the same for all their rooms) a large window with an expansive view of Canal Street. We were on our usual gallery/museum jaunt and the location of the Sheraton with two subway lines within three blocks and two more within four blocks, served us very well. Then too, I had not visited the 9-11 Memorial which is about 10 or 11 blocks to the south (we walked it) and took this opportunity to do so. Restaurants around the hotel are plentiful and varied from small, hole-in-the-wall places to some of New York's finest dining experiences. Could not ask for better. The Sheraton’s staff were absolutely first rate, if a bit overly-enthusiastic. I don’t need to be greeted every time I cross the lobby but that’s what the staff did. They were efficient, very helpful and knowledgeable about Tribeca and seemed genuinely pleased to help us. In all the times I've visited NYC over the years, I don't think I've come across a friendlier crew. I cannot recommend the Sheraton Tribeca more highly. Every aspect of the hotel was near perfect.

He also quoted us $50 when we got in the car but two minutes from LGA he told us it was $55.

We had the pleasure of meeting the front desk manager Katie - who was very friendly and went out of her way to make our stay very memorable. The door men were amazing too!

I finally decided that I would stay down in the TriBeCa area as it had good access to all other areas, and what a good choice I made. When we arrived we were greeted by Mia who welcomed us to the hotel & swiftly checked us in. Our room was warm, clean & had a view of the 'Empire State Building' from our window. We chose to travel the subway for our sight seeing and the hotel was perfectly situated with the subway 2 mins walk away, $31 gets you 7 days unlimited travel. Soho, Little Italy, Grenwich village, Chinatown were all within walking distance. Eating & drinking in the hotel was expensive, very over priced, were charged $36 for 2 drinks....wow!!! The hotel had everything we needed for our trip, comfy bed, clean room, warm (it was freezing outside) & good location. Front desk staff were helpful, friendly & are an asset to the hotel.

They said they would have one delivered while we were gone. We came back to our room that night and our room was left cracked open. I called down to the front desk and they said they were very sorry and would take this very seriously and send someone up with a machine to check the door lock. I called them back the next day to see what they found out and they told us that it showed we were the last ones there and we had left it open. I told them that was impossible because the mini fridge was in our room and we didn't get back until that night. She said they would have someone look at footage and get back to us. So the next day I called again and they told me they had footage of someone coming out of our room and leaving the door open. Which really freaked me out because I knew it wasn't us! I asked to see the video and they said someone would be there the next day and they could show us. So our whole trip from Sunday to when we checked out on Wednesday I had to deal with the situation and then them telling me it was our fault. Finally Wednesday I talked to someone who said again that we left our door open and that they would try to find the footage for us to see. When we went down to check out and look at the footage the woman came up and said ok the person leaving the room was blurry and it might of been one of our maintenance workers. Still not taking responsibility for it! She said we are very sorry what can we do? We got one night comped but it wasn't even worth it. My whole trip I was arguing with these people. I understand accidents happen but I'm writing this review because they blamed us the entire time and didn't take responsibility. I will never return to this hotel again! ,,Amber G,11,1.0

I have been coming to the Sheraton Tribeca every couple of weeks for about 5 months. I am not going to stay here again.Positive - Location. Right above subway station and close to restaurants and Soho shopping. Staff are overall very friendly, seem genuinely welcoming.Negatives - The rooms on each floor are mostly spread across one side of a hallway with elevator banks and utility rooms on the other side. Unless you have a room at either end of the hallway, you have noisy elevators, dinging and doors opening and closing all day and night. Service is spotty. Rooms are not assigned as promised, things don't work - TV, heater, window, etc. I was promised an upgrade on my next trip after a variety of service failures and returned a week later to have one of the smallest rooms in the hotel. Keys don't work, the bar service is spotty and often you can't get a bartender to serve a drink. I made a car service reservation through the bellman for a trip to Newark Airport in the morning and the car was not there. Bellman are often hard to find and getting a cab in front of the hotel is difficult. Its seems every time I stay there are minor service failures and if you bring it to management's attention, you don't seem to get any response.

It's right slap between supercool Soho, Tribeca and not far from the Village, but in itself is not a supercool designer led hotel - more on that later. It is also quite frankly if you want to use the subway, one of the best located hotels in all of Manhattan since virtually all lines to the East or West sides converge within a few blocks of one another on Canal St. Navigation between them is fast on Canal St compared to the midtown sidewalk scrum.Within 50 odd metres of the door you can take the A subway straight to Howard Beach for the JFK Airtrain or vice-versa. Takes about an hour airport to hotel. If you're travelling alone this is far cheaper than a cab of course.Some have mentioned the immediate area as being depressing and feeling somewhat unsafe. Sorry, don't get this. There are probably about 5-10 trinket/T-Shirt shops to the East of the hotel on Canal St that are pretty downmarket, and sure you can have a few guys hanging round outside. This is New York, not Beverly Hills. 100m to the West on Canal you have a Maserati dealer. Yep, real downmarket.....Canal St itself is of course a very busy thoroughfare, and so the property fronting it is not the ritziest or nicest looking. Step left or right and you are immediately in a different world - Soho or Tribeca quiet and atmospheric streets, with amazing independent restaurants and Cafe's, and all the types of shops with character you could possibly need. This area is great for just wandering and seeing what you find for dinner, lunch or gifts etc. Battery Park is probably 30mins by foot, Washington Square 20mins, Broadway Shops 10mins, and Midtown is 20min by Subway. If staying on Times Square is not your main concern, this is a great area.Now to the hotel itself. It's surrounded by the type of characterful districts I love in New York, but itself is somewhat more middle-of-the-road. Sure there are local landmark pictures adorning the walls and the decor is certainly not ""bad"" - but if you're looking for Boutique hotel ambiance, style or character this isn't your place. It's not quirky, but if that's not what you're looking for that's just fine. Sometimes a writing desk or bathroom not comprising a glass bubble in the middle of the room is what you want. The facilities tick the boxes but probably no more: The gym is fine for a 20 minute workout but no more, the bar and restaurant are clean and presentable, but not exactly characterful. The club Lounge has a great view and we were lucky with the weather - being on the terrace to admire the view was fine. But the Club Lounge itself is overwhelmed with numbers especially in the morning, and this means the cleanliness and standards slip. If the facilities can't cope with the numbers, don't offer it to so many - simple. Having said that the breakfast selection was fine and better than expected, and the evening drinks/snacks were useful for those wanting to stay in (certainly saves the pennies)I had a Suite, so other than the Presidential room these were the biggest and nicest in the place. No problems - clean, well presented, a touch dated in some parts but perfectly nice and well appointed with settee, chairs/table etc. Great for a longer stay. Other rooms are obviously smaller but I can't comment on them.The staff were, without question super friendly. I checked in several hours later than the rest of my family, and I was immediately welcomed by name - ""welcome, you must be XXXX"" - nice touch. This standard continued with us being welcomed back each time, and the front desk staff also helping with some gift wrapping needs which goes above and beyond expectations. Front of House is an asset to this hotel, and probably adds another notch to the grade for many people.So, a balanced review I think. If you go understanding what the hotel style is and where it is, you'll be just fine - I was for my needs this time on a family vacation, and I've stayed all over New York. If you want Soho chic or Boutique cool/bar scene, you need to stay in a different hotel.","Nuremberg, Germany","Gibble1979</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nuremberg, Germany</strong>",39,4.0

Pro/First impression: the staff was EXTREMELY friendly & super cool. I still think this, but it is unfortunate that we don't think as highly of the facilities themselves.They also left a welcome bottle of wine in our room since it was our anniversary. Again, super friendly folks. The area itself is both a pro & con. The actual street and aesthetic of where the hotel is is super depressing. It's very very run down. However, it is a convenient area in that it is only a block or two from the NICE & visually pleasing areas of Soho & Tribeca. But the cons...- Aesthetic: the rooms are tiny (ok whatever) but they do not look nice. Sounds like some may be remodeled? but I assumed ours was not as it was an all yellow & brown room. Looked extremely out dated, bare, and stale.- View: the view from our 14th floor room was very depressing and bleak. It overlooked super dilapidated buildings and graffiti. - Shower: the shower smelled like sour mold (dirty washcloth smell) from the moment we arrived. I honestly always wanted the door shut bc of that smell. I couldn't find out what was causing it bc it didn't LOOK dirty, but there was just that dirty washcloth smell, must be mold somewhere. Even every time it would be cleaned by services, it would still have that smell. Not awful - but not pleasant.- The flush button on the toilet was visibly broken & partially missing.- The room trash cans were two blue commercial recycling bins. Both the same. Looked like a work office - not very 4-star chic if you know what I mean. I love that they had recycling but the fact that both the bins (next to each other) were the same, you had to decide yourself which to use as recycling and which to use as a waste bin - I doubt that the people picking up the trash know to make this assessment. Worry that it's all just grouped together as trash in the end.- No amenities, no mini fridge.- Towels were the very rough, thin, cheap kind. - TV was fuzzy.- Elevators always took forever with often lines to wait for them (not really their fault though). Towards the end, one of the elevators was broken, though.The cleaning lady who serviced our room was very sweet & nice, once left a cute happy new year note on our desk - again, staff was wonderful, facilities not so much. We were really baffled why this was considered a 4 star - most 3 star we stay in are significantly ""nicer"" than this was.","Austin, Texas","Kelly G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",0,3.0

Unfortunately, very rude fellow working as the attendant in the SPG Club Lounge. A real lout, actually. Didn't see anyone on duty in the fairly full and lively lounge when I entered with my companion at about 8:45pm, so reached into one of the mini-coolers at the back for a bottle of tonic water. This was apparently a no-no. A thin African-American man wearing glasses, probably in his late twenties came up behind us shouting, ""What do you think you're doing!"" and saying that things close at 8:30 and if we wanted anything we had to come through him so he could get it, etc., etc. So loud, obnoxious and rude, we didn't even realize that he was an employee at first. Then he brusquely asked, ""What do you want?"" I replied calmly that I was trying to get a tonic water. His next question was, ""One or two?"" I said that ""two would be nice,"" which apparently wasn't the right way to answer, because now he raised his voice again, ""ONE OR TWO?"" in a very belligerent way. His final act of insolence was to hand me the two small bottles of tonic water over his shoulder without looking at me or acknowledging us further. Another couple at the cooler on the other side were just cringing for us and just as bewildered by his attitude and behavior. We walked over to look out onto the terrace, but we left after a couple of minutes. It really was an unnecessarily tense atmosphere and we didn't feel comfortable there. Sad that we couldn't enjoy what is a really nice lounge and it left a bad taste after what had been a fantastic day. The kicker is that on the way out, I noticed a giant handwritten sign marked ""TIPS"" taped to an ice bucket on the counter near the coolers!Reported the incident immediately to the front desk supervisor (Mairovi) and indicated how strongly we felt about it. She took our information, confirmed it in the system and said she would let the management know about what occurred. Was disappointed we didn't hear anything the next day, and still haven't been contacted 48 hours later. I can only guess that she wanted the info in order to suppress the automatic emailing of the Guest Experience Index survey Starwood sends after every stay, because a bad rating really hurts them. Sure enough, haven't received one for this stay. Funny how that happens. Shady.All a great pity, because the rooms are nice and other staff members were great. Especially front desk agents Mia, Leslie, and the entire bell staff who helped us safely store some unique items. Leslie in particular, worked with my Starwood ambassador to provide a welcome gift surprise for my sister, who was also staying at the hotel. Nice hotel, but just be careful of the guy in the Club Lounge! Certainly didn't live up to the Starwood Service Commitment promises.",nyc,"strwd p</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>nyc</strong>",2,2.0

The club lounge on 21st floor had a great view including the terrace which looks out towards the empires state building. Soon looked after the club room at night and he was a star!! Club room or lounge has wine, beer, cheese, crackers, olives and fresh fruit etc all served between 5.30pm to 8.30pm each night. Club room is also open 24 hours a day for light refreshments, snacks including tea and coffee so is really convenient. Staff at the hotel are all super friendly and greet you at reception each day when you leave or return to the hotel - it's amazing the difference friendly smiles make each day! Only slight downside is the breakfast in club room is a little crowded at times, typical American breakfast style ( sausage and eggs, muffins, pastry, cereals, yoghurt and oats and very fresh bagels daily) The breakfast staff are not as bright as the rest of the hotel, though they offer you vouchers for the downstairs restaurant if the lounge is too crowded. The hotel is convenient to Canel street station, and lots of restaurants and easy walking distance to Soho and Nolita and lots of other great areas.

There are many restaurants and shops around, there's a great little wine store a few blocks away on Grand street, the subway is just around the corner on W Broadway that will take you right to the hotspots in Midtown (E train). What I love about this location is that you get away from the Midtown madness and get, I feel, a more calm local vibe which is excellent.

I was here with my partner for my birthday - the hotel had agreed in advanced to put on some 'extras' to make it a special occasion - the extras turned up late and the concierge who was meant to organise flowers had been 'unavailable' all week so this hadn't been seen too - no apology was made for this lapse in service. If my partner hadn't been in contact regularly with the hotel staff to try and organise this I would have accepted these little slip ups - but he and I were both let down by laziness and poor communication within their team. In addition to this - Housekeeping failed to replenish teas and coffee/towels every day and had to be chased up, hotel management didn't seemed too concerned about this low level of service when we raised it several times. All we were looking for was recognition that this wasn't great and some reassurances that it wouldn't happen again, which we didn't get. The substandard customer service continues. On checking out - further frustrations as the receptionist attempted to charge us again for the room (pre-paid several months ago) and when she finally conceded we had already paid - proceeded to charge us for the water in the room. We confirmed with her that we had not used the over priced water bottles and she agreed that this was correct and she would not charge us.

It is in a hopping area (Canal and Broadway) and as safe as any other location but is really central to so many great spots. Couple of pointers.

It seems impossible that I am in the same hotel that the other reviewers described.When I got to my room, I looked around trying to find the closet. No closet, but there was a space to hang clothes in a little armoire. There were NO drawers in the rest of the room (not even in the nightstand). Where do they expect one to store their underwear?!?!? I'm staying here for eight days - but it looks like I don't have anywhere to unpack! I checked out the bathroom- visible dust layer where the wallpaper meets the tile and just a shower - no bathtub. Bed had feather pillows - even though I specified that I was allergic.I unpacked and went downstairs to head out for dinner. I figured that I should let the front desk know that I am beyond disappointed with the room. I had opted for the lowest priced room (still $365 per night) so I wasn't mad - I just thought maybe this is what you get for the lower price and I maybe had the worst room in the hotel. The front desk was lovely- she told me that none of the hotel rooms had drawers (what?!?) but she would try to find me another room that at least had a tub and was on a higher floor. I was really appreciative that they were so accommodating. But then.....I arrived in the new room. It is about a third smaller than the other tiny room. It has a bathtub but still no drawers- just a tiny two shelf bookcase. The bed has a feather blanket and all feather pillows (I thought we've established that I am allergic?!?) There are weird dirty handprints on the doors. I would have preferred the original room but I have already packed up all my stuff and moved it at this point and it's almost midnight.I would have gladly paid a higher nightly rate to move to a better room (but she told me she was moving me to a better room...) I don't understand how the front desk could think that this was a better room. So I'm sitting here in shock. My eyes are watering (not because I'm crying about sleeping in a dirty closet disguised as a hotel room) but because there are feathers in my bed. I have NO IDEA how Starwood could put their brand on this place and I have absolutely no idea how this place could have four stars.

However when staying at this hotel this was not part of either my two experiences there - the first when staying one night by myself having travelled from Australia (with two large suitcases and hand luggage) and being dropped at the hotel by limousine as I had travelled business class with Emirates (wonderful airline) and then secondly when returning some 4-5 weeks later with my 39 year old daughter to stay for 4 nights (on an SPG floor level) before once again returning to Australia (trip to airport in limo to fly out with Emirates) No one offered to assist me on either occasion with my luggage or anything else. When staying with my daughter we had to ask for sufficient toiletries for two people (even though the room was booked for 2 people) We also asked for some additional creamer satchels and teabags as the ""long life"" milk had gone off and we had to throw our tea out. Upon both requests a staff member begrudgingly turned up with the items and almost threw them at me. On a positive note, whilst the room was small, it was quiet, clean and typically the Sheraton beds were ""to die for"" - such comfort. I loved the area it was located in - within walking distance of Soho, Chinatown and Little Italy, and easy to reach other locations on the subway. When I stayed for the 4 nights with my daughter, as an SPG member, we were able to access free breakfast and the 5-8pm cocktail hour, both of which provided good food and sufficient tables.

Basically the opposite of what I needed at that moment. He clearly does not understand the requirements of his position, which are to be hospitable and welcoming, the basic essence of what some good old fashioned basic customer service is. I had had an excellent two night stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, (for which I used up all my points to book!). Unfortunately, upon checkout, I had had such a smooth, flawless, perfect magical 72 hours in NYCand I was so happy, that I forgot my driver's license as well as my phone charger in the room. Oops. My bad. Completely. I did not realize that I had forgotten those items until it was 2 am at the Newark Airport, trying to get my Hertz rental, because I was going to drive to the Sheraton in Edison that night(BECAUSE I BASICALLY LIVE AT SPG HOTELS BECAUSE OF WORK). By this time, my phone was also dead, so I was stranded with no phone and no driver license and no store was open for me to buy a charger. So the nice Hertz lady understood my situation and did her best to help me. She got me the number for the Sheraton Tribeca and I called to ask if the staff had found my forgotten items. The overnight manager that I spoke to was defensive, rude, and made me feel bad. I was in a tough situation and needed reassurance that if I had left items in the room, my items were safe and they wouldve been found, and that as soon as housekeeping came in the morning, we would be able to verify if the items HAD INDEED been found. Instead, he was trying to argue with me when he asked for my number to call me back and I told him I could not give him my cell phone number because it was dead and I couldnt charge it because the SHERATON TRIBECA HAD MY PHONE CHARGER! But, he wasn't listening to me and I was so frustrated at the whole situation that I just wanted to cry. It is just appauling that a manager in the hospitality industry would not listen and understand when a guest needs some actual help/friendly reassurance in a difficult/scary situation. The incompetence at this level of management is unacceptable, and I am surprised that this even happened. I've stayed at SPG hotels in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Massachusetts, Florida, Illinois, even New Jersey, and in Mexico too, and I never once filed a complaint because everywhere I have been treated professionally, courteously, and SPG truly feels like home, but the Sheraton Tribeca simply did not have my back and I am disappointed and bummed at the way I was treated.

How can I tell? Because (a) the wall opposite the air vent was caked up with dark dustbunnies. I actually pulled the desk away from the wall, used a tissue to wipe off all of the dustbunnies, and pushed the furniture back. Gross.(b) the top of the room's windows - also in direct receipt of the air force - were blackened with soot and dust. I did not bother to climb up and clean the windows. I'm only 1/2 crazy, I guess.Aside from this, other glaring maintenance issues were present in the room: a broken switchplate covering a prominent electrical outlet. Grime on the shower door threshold. Mildew on just about every inch of grout in the shower. A slow drain in the sink. A broken hinge on the armoir door. The towels are all very thin, worn down, and thread-bare with little holes or fraying edges in some places. The towels also had some dark marks on them - permanent stains that should take the towels out of circulation. The comforter had stains on it. The wallpaper was scuffed and stained in a multitude of places, the walls just had black marks all over them. Also behind the desk, on the carpet, was a mountain of longterm dust. And on the ceiling - also by the air vent - orange stains from what looks like (very old) water damage, which of course should have been repainted and wasn't.This place is just not cleaned adequately. I stayed here on Starpoints because it is a good value in terms of point redemptions in the Starwood brand, but like everything on earth, you get what you pay for. It is far below the standard for a Sheraton property. I called the front desk to report these items and also reported these notes in the SPG follow-up survey and never got a reply from either channel.I'd have to say, as a 50-night/year Starwood guest, this particular property is far below par, just on simple cleanliness.There are additional minor problems with the hotel - that is, a very crowded Club Lounge (are they over-selling club lounge access?) and too few elevators, resulting in a very very long wait at peak times - when you are most in a hurry. But these could be forgiven if the rooms were clean.","Los Angeles, California","ilovestayinginhotels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",36,2.0

And whether or not the water will be hot when you decide to take a shower was a crap shoot. The water pressure was low, and it was impossible to turn on the shower without blasting yourself with cold water.I would prefer not to stay here again, but who knows, maybe the other more expensive TriBeCa hotels are just as bad.

The bar in the hotel is expensive, charging the same,for a glass of wine as the Soho grand down the road, however you would expect to pay that in the grand due to its beautiful decor.The rooms were of a good size, the bed was very comfy, we were on the 15th floor and heard no road noise. The room had no bath robes or slippers however a quick call to reception and these were supplied. Overall a good hotel, great value for money and the staff are very attentive and helped us with printing and booking reservations when needed. We would stay again if we had a busy trip planned.

For some reason, the buildings across the street are all vacant and it makes the whole area feel really sketchy and strange, but don't hold it against the hotel, the hotel is awesome!Just behind the hotel is a cute little neighborhood. There's a Japanese place called Tataki on Lispenard street (right next to the cool looking Dive bar.) Dine in or take away, it's VERY reasonable, for New York, heck it's just reasonable.The hotel is bijoux, it's a gem, but small, that's New York. I loved my room on the Club Level, it was tucked away in a corner and had the best king bed I've ever slept in, other than my own. I will say that it is small. Very small. Interior cabin on a cruise ship small. So what? It was VERY functional and comfortable. No one comes to New York to hang out in the room.I will also say that I'll be staying here for the next couple of months for work, and I'm going to enjoy the very large shower, the shelving in the bathroom and the comfort height commode. The little wardrobe is perfect for my 4 days of clothing, The TV with the nearly 100 awesome cable channels is a great way to unwind when I get back to the room after a long day on site with my customer. I cannot say enough about the staff. Nelson at check-in took care of me, asked me how my day was, and made sure that everything was perfect with my stay.The folks at Antica helped me get some Pasta to eat late at night after a VERY long day. The room is impeccably clean and even in New York, in my little room in the corner of the hotel, it was very quiet, although close to the elevators and ice machine. There's a Planet Fitness right in the hotel. The Club level has a fantastic river view and breakfast is a varied assortment of carbs. Bagels, with all sorts of spreads. Fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal and those wanting protein, hard boiled eggs for breakfast. Starbucks coffee, and an espresso machine for hot milk an depth charges. In the evenings there are cheeses, veggies, assorted nuts, pasta and hors d'oeurves. That carb thing...more protein!The Canal street subway station is right around the corner, and should get you everywhere you need to go. The SoHo pharmacy is an odd little corner of the world, with strange cosmetics and snacks, so check that out. The Black Burger is a very cheap place to get a nom. If you must, Dunkin Donuts is across the street. Imagine it gets weird, but in a good way after dark. TriBeCa bagels is right next door and open 24 hours, except for Jewish holidays. In all, I liked this hotel and I'm happy that I'll be staying there.","Atlanta, Georgia","Ruth B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",139,5.0

This was the only positive thing I can say about the hotel, besides a very helpful guy outside the hotel, who will find you a taxi in no time.First of all the room isn't at all spacious as the picture's indicating. They are very small, and with two normal sized luggage it really was a challenge to fit in the room.Secondly, the cleaning of the room was under average of what you would expect from a four star hotel. We found a belt under the curtains... A bit of an embarrassment for the cleaning service I'd say. Thirdly, and the worst thing, the indoor climate causes you red eyes and we experienced, that the ventilation system are not capable to cool down the room in the summer time, without you having a hard time with your eyes and your respiratory system. Therefore we only used the hotel room for sleeping. When confronting the hotel's service at the final day, when asking whether we enjoyed our stay, we were met with an arrogant attitude. Basically he said, that when we didn't complain from the beginning, it was our problem, not Sheraton's. On top he wasn't at all apologetic. I found that very rude. Who wants to use the vacation time to discuss with the hotel personnel about standards for a Sheraton hotel?

We wanted his honest opinion, not a canned answer. The same goes for the staff in the bar and the cafe. They seemed as if they were there to do their job and didn't want to go above and beyond.

In the evening they say they have cocktails during a certain time. And I heard a gentleman asking for a beer and he was charged separately for it unlike club lounges everywhere else in the world where everything is complementary. I had soft drinks though and they didn't charge for that. Important Note- ask the hotel the international call rates before taking a call from the room phone. We had to make an urgent overseas call that just lasted 57 seconds and were told the charge was $200 for that 57 seconds..

To begin, the place told me check-in is 3 P.M., so when I arrived at 8 P.M. that evening I was quite surprised to hear that all three of the rooms my friends and I had booked were not yet ready. Once an hour (no more or less) I would check on the status of our rooms. The people at the front desk, as well as the manager, were unhelpful and outright rude. As the hours ticked by there was no discount or form of compensation offered to make up for this waiting period... not even a free bottle of water (which cost $8.00 a bottle). It was almost midnight when the rooms were ready... but two of the rooms were not adjoining as they were supposed to be. To the contrary, two rooms were on opposite sides of the floor, and one of them was on a different floor entirely. But I'm taking too long now. So let me give you a list of the other benefits of staying at this amazingly terrible establishment: the toilet in my room was broken, and the manager said my only option was to use the pubic restroom on the second floor. Another major dilemma for us was the fact that two of the pull-out beds in the couches did not work. Live insects feasted on dead insects underneath one of these couches in my friends room. Management didn't even offer an apology. You know what? There are at least four other things I could complain about, but I don't want to waste any more of my time dwelling on this nightmare.

On the one hand, their staff did eventually fix a couple problems. But the fact that they caused the biggest of the problems AND the absurd lengths I had to go to get solutions just leaves me feeling like a 1 star is deserved.First, our travel agent definitely informed the hotel we would be arriving late on our first night. No one took note of that. In fact, the hotel gave away our room! So, after 30 hours of flying, we arrive smelly, worn out, just wanting a shower, and ""Sorry sir, we have nothing for you."" We waited 5 hours for a room to open up.Then (get this) a few weeks later I open our credit card statement to find the hotel had gone ahead and charged us for the first night! Full rack rate: more than $500! No one had informed us of this at the time we checked in. Eventually, our travel agent was able to show the hotel that they had made a mistake and they refunded it more than a month later.The third problem we had was our fault to begin. We left an item of clothing in the room. The staff said they could arrange to have it sent back, which eventually happened. So we're thankful for that. But we had to chase and chase and chase to get any action. Over more than a week we made 5 phone calls and sent several emails, being handed off to other people several times. In the end, the $12 shipping cost was much less of a cost than the hair pulled out of my scalp as I tried to find the right person who could help us. Basically, the stay was a major source of frustration. The staff there could have made it all work fine if they'd been slightly attentive to detail. Instead, we were put out in a big way. I won't stay at this hotel ever again, and I'll seriously think twice about staying at another Sheraton unless I have no other alternative.","Washington, DC","MarkP_9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",68,1.0

Our rooms were clean, beds super comfortable, plenty of pillows and a relaxing shower head with plenty of hot water. There were 4 people in our group (2 rooms).

Make sure you don't get a room near the elevators (for some reason the engine is rather noisy) and not on the 20th floor (because you are right below the lounge and you hear people walking, moving chars, etc.). Overall, not the best hotel of this chain, though rather decent for NYC type of service. Other remarks to consider : strangely their keys stopped working several times (hopefully not because they assigned our room to other guests, it happened to me in other hotels!) and their common areas are super cold (so bring something heavy to survive the artic temperatures of the corridors and of the lounge - it was a continuous battle even to set our room temperature, we left it at 75 and every day housekeeping set it to 65!).","Milan, Italy","HUJ765</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milan, Italy</strong>",115,3.0

For getting around the City, the location is unbeatable - right near the Canal Street subway stop, so an easy ride up to the Village, Fifth Avenue, Times Square/Broadway, and Central Park. For first-time visitors to the City (which I am not), it's close enough to Times Square, etc. to be convenient, but far enough from the crazy crush of crowds. The hotel is tastefully decorated with old photos of the City, but our room was extremely small, which is to be expected in NYC. For some, the price point at over $220 per night (a wedding rate) may not justify the small room (i.e., the bathroom had narrow, french-style doors that opened inward, leaving little space between the shower, toilet, and vanity; most storage space was in the closest at the end of a small hallway opening up onto the bed and the desk area). That being said, we requested a room with a City view (and got a one!) and so the architecture of the building may have required a smaller room. The hotel staff was kind and accommodating, and the open-area business center and Starbucks in the lobby are convenient. With the great service and location, we'd definitely stay at the Sheraton Tribeca again.","Boulder, Colorado","Brenna F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",17,4.0

For this, the location was fantastic.We stayed on the club floor, level 22, and had a large (by NYC standards) room with a big window that looked out onto East Manhattan. The room was comfortable and more than fine for a week long stay. The club floor stay also provided access to the club lounge, with complimentary breakfast and evening appetizers each day. The breakfast didn't change through the week (bacon, potatoes, scrambled eggs) and fruit options were very minimal. More variety over the days would have been good, especially as the hotel increased in busyness as the week went on but breakfast provisions didn't seem to match this increase. Tribeca Bagels right next door to the hotel is good for a quick breakfast.Staff were friendly, our heating worked, and overall we had a great stay. Highly recommend if you're looking for something not in Midtown, but still with plenty of options nearby for things to do and close by to all the subway lines you could need!","Sydney, Australia","mgnmng</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",37,4.0

The Sheraton Tribeca is convenient for my travels so I thought I would give it a shot. The hotel appears to be relatively new, my first impression is it is quite tight on space, how they squeezed it in I don't know, you'll likely miss the front door (look for the Tribeca Bagel sign which is huge, and next door!). Inside however the reception, lobby, bar and casual computer area is very well done with high ceilings etc and it is very comfortable. The bar has good beers, cocktails etc and fun and friendly staff - to be honest all the staff were amazing, it's nice to have some banter and fun with them rather than they are just polite. There is also a starbucks on site, awesome :) There is a restaurant which I think is only open for breakfast so I didn't use it. All rooms you have to use a lift/elevator, there are 3 so you can have a little wait. The corridors to the rooms are tight, not a big deal but gives you a sense that they squeezed this in. The room itself was as expected, very new and clean which is always a good start, the bed/linen was great. There is a desk for working, but with cases etc space was a bit of a premium. I had room service, must say the food was very good, but again tight space on where to sit/eat. The room overlooked the road, and traffic noise was an issue (I was on floor 9), just a warning, this is New York, it is a big city and the hotel is on a main street. The internet was also wanting, ""speed"" was an issue and drop outs using WiFi, however when I used the ethernet cable things were fine (I'm a technology guy, it wasn't a ""user"" issue!). The Sheraton also have this Green initiative going, where you don't get new towels/linen everyday, which is a good thing but be warned this means you're off the housekeeping list, so you need to call down for bins and they don't tidy the room/make the bed etc.Overall the room was a little tight, but well kept, the traffic noise and internet was an issue (but the Lenovo's in the lobby were great). I'd really like to give this 3.5 stars, I think 3 is probably a little too low but not quite 4 stars either. The bar, staff etc are all brilliant and the location is great too. There are plenty of other options in the area in the same price range, I'm sure they have their pro's and con's too (I've stayed in many!). It's not a bad choice by any stretch, but has a lot of competition that you could consider in the same price range.","Boca Raton, Florida","CarlFrog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boca Raton, Florida</strong>",48,3.0
