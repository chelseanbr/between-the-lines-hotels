This time around, I got a room half the size. When I called the reception, I was told only certain floors are available. They don't open the floors where nurses stay at during COVID19.It makes no sense to me that I paid a few hundred bucks to stay at smaller room with no other options. I am grateful that the city is offering free hotels for healthcare professionals especially since I am a healthcare provider myself in NYC, but I regret choosing to pay to stay at this hotel.

There was no porter, which you would expect at a large hotel but there was a nice security guard who welcomed us with his dog. No front of house staff, so myself and our wife has no interaction with anyone other then the security guard. I wish this continued.....We went to reception to check in like 2 excited kids (first time in NY) and greeted the reception staff how we would have been expected to be greeted- the response was a lift of a head (from her phone) and a short, not warm- “checking in”. We let that pass, however not a good impression.Me and my wife are celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary- so as you cheekily do, requested a new view, maybe an upgrade if possible- the response was “your room is allocated, and i can do anything about this”- which completely contradicts the other reviews from guests who have? Anyway, again let this slide.We went down a dark dingy corridor behind reception and got in our lift to our room. We got to our room and it wasnt too bad, the view not great but nice and it seemed cleaned. How wrong were we? Pubic hair in the sink, really dirty cups in the room, no water (would have been a nice touch)- i could continue but i hope you all get my drift! At this point we thought dont worry, have a shower and crack on- the pressure in the shower is basically non existent- quiet possibly the worst shower we have ever used!!! Determined to not let this get in the way off us enjoying the rest off our holiday, we got ready and went to reception to see if they had any tips on the whats around, how to get around town etc. We avoided the extremely rude receptionist we spoke to initially (who was still on her phone) and went to speak the other one. Her response “Google it”- i mean for god sakes! Just appalling service.We are not 2 nights into a 4 night stay and honestly the staff have been nothing but rude, unfriendly and unhelpful. Note to management- if you want to represent your brand in the right way, employ individuals that have the same care for customers and experience as you advertise. The guys you have working here honestly dont!!Never will i return to this hotel and as someone who regularly uses the Hilton group i will be avoiding you going forwards.We are still staying in the hotel for another couple of nights so if anything does happen to change my opinion i will happily consider updating this review but as it stands- STAY AWAY! Actually considering checking in somewhere else if this gets worse and will be complaining to British Airways also (we booked a package deal through them!)- sometimes money just is not everything!Positive: bed is comfy but hotel needs an update in general!Awful awful experience from a very unhappy customers!","London, United Kingdom","rajbathia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,1.0

I have a gold status and stay regularly at Hilton/Conrad/Waldorf, etc. though, the service that I experiences is by far the worst that I have seen in the last couple of years. they simply dont care about your well being. nobody helps you with luggage when you arrive. then they check you in the wrong room, then you have to go back down and up in another one - obviously carrying your luggage. the 2nd day you find your room, not cleaned/tidied up and the only explanation you get from the manager is: we dont know why - the housekeeping said they had done it. then they want to make up for it with a free coffee downstairs and the next colleague attacks you that you cannot have the cappuccino but only the filter coffee, and the Cheese cake is a desert and not pastry so you have to pay extra - this 'make up' experience converts into another service frustration. on the day of our check-out (depite gold status late check out) - the house keeping lady knocks three times on our door to 'check' what time we d leave. at 10, 10.45 and 12h. (even though her colleagues granted us 13h check out). Another issue was the noise the hotel personal would do in the morning between 7-9AM when joking and running in the hallway. on the check out, they simply show you a copy of the bill that has been depited to your credit card without checking. It obviously charged us a breakfast that was initially complementary. and last but not least, the executive lounge is only open in the morning with a miserable breakfast buffet and broken instant coffee machine. the regular buffet in the restaurant is decent but the blue berries were moisy and I found some hairs in my omlette..... all these things are just not acceptable for a hilton in that category.

My overall impression is that the hotel is very nice, however, they are very bad at communicating.On my last visit, I was given a different room to the one I had paid for. Originally I booked the 2 Story Loft Suite with King bed. I emailed the Diamond desk to request that I was allocated the exact room booked as it was a surprise for my partner. They forwarded my request to the hotel directly. After a few weeks with no reply, I then emailed the hotel directly to see if they can could confirm my request, again no reply.I hoped that if they didn't reply they would at least have actioned my request. Upon arriving at the hotel check-in desk very little was said and I assumed that I would be allocated the correct room, I couldn't ask if this was going to be the case as it would have ruined my partners surprise. Unfortunately, when getting to the room it wasn't as expected. There were two bedrooms and only one floor, the original room was supposed to be 1000 sq ft but the allocated room was 100 sq ft smaller with additional wasted space in the form of the second bedroom.After returning home I complained that the room wasn't what it should have been and I got the reply 'the hotel has contacted you directly'. They hadn't, I even included in my complaint that the hotel has never contacted me. Customer services went quiet once more, even after chasing multiple times.Finally, I raised the issue on Twitter where customer services were very quick to assist and informed me that the 'hotel is having renovations at the moment' and this is why I was not allocated the correct room. It would have been nice to inform me of this before we arrived or even at the front desk.From experience Hilton Hotels that are having renovations clearly state this on the hotel website, so I am unsure if this was true or if I have been fobbed off. I was given 30k points, but this really doesn't cover the fact that I wasn't allocated the room I booked and the Executive lounge was closed the entire stay after breakfast, supposedly for the same reason of being renovated. Though there were no signs of any work being done.I would consider another Hilton on my next return to New York.","Norwich, United Kingdom","rossbeer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwich, United Kingdom</strong>",6,3.0

When my friend and I got up to the front desk, we told them we wanted to equally split Room and Tax (RT) between us and they ended up authorizing my card for the full amount of RT and also charging me for my half of RT as well. So almost all my funds I've saved up for my vacation got tied up into the hotel. When I looked at my bank account and noticed this, I had to speak with multiple people just to get this problem resolved. I didn't get my authorization back until days later. Causing the first few days of my vacation very stressful.. I also had an issue with the TV in my room. When we turned it on the screen would be bright and normal then almost immediately start to dim and turn so dark it was hard to see what was happening on screen. I had to call for an engineer multiple times to get this problem resolved. They canceled my consecutive reservation and when I got the email and when I went to speak with them about this, they blamed me for the canceled reservation and I had to book my room again at a higher rate than what I originally had for my consecutive stay... they also tried to charge me $89 for breakfast even though I'm a gold member. That did get resolved quickly though, which I'm grateful for. Overall the hotel is beautiful and in a great location, but the experience was greatly lacking.

Once he found them he asked, as if hoping the answer would be ""no,"" ""do you need help taking your bags up?"" When we replied that we did, he asked the older gentleman behind the desk who was engrossed with something on his phone, ""is it your turn or mine?"" Discovering it was his turn he again looked none to pleased and said he would meet us at our room. We had booked what we thought would be a nice suite that turned out to have two floors. When the bellman arrived we asked him to bring the bags to the entry on the second floor, 29M. He then got lost apparently going to the 30th floor and knocking there for a while before calling our room and sorting out there was a sub-floor.The room itself was in questionable repair for a ""suite."" Cracked paint everywhere, the showerhead in the main floor bathroom was only partially functioning, a very loud fan in the main floor bathroom never shutoff, reader lamps on the master bed were burned out, the TVs were laughably small, and the master bedroom TV seemed to be stuck noticeably dimmer than the living room TV.On departure, we once again had the ""pleasure"" of engaging with the bell staff. The morning bellman asked me to help him roll the bags into the small storage room. Once we were alone he started by bad-mouthing his colleague, insinuating he was an idiot for not having a pen. Then, to make sure our interaction was sufficiently awkward, he informed me that, ""we don't charge for storing bags but we do appreciate tips."" I let him know I didn't have any cash on me and would try to bring some back later when I picked up the bags. To which he replied, rather disappointedly, that he might not be around later to receive the tip.The bellman on duty when we departed, a tall, grey-haired gentleman, was probably the only good interaction we had. He was cheerful and seemed happy to help. He let us know the yellow cabs would probably be a little cheaper than Uber for our trip to JFK and secured us one large enough to fit our 4 bags.Overall the majority of staff interactions were terrible.

Stay 1 - Hilton Times Square, Stay 2 - Hilton London NYC, Stay 3 - Millennium Hilton UN Plaza.Without contest, The Millennium wins hands down.First of all, thank you for responding to all my emails, and facebook messages prior to our visit, promptly and efficiently.We booked a corner king room, a friend of mine who works for Hilton kindly asked the hotel if they could do anything for me (i am a member of HH), they made sure we had the best view possible on floor 40, and access to the lounge. This was already prior arranged and assigned and i could not wait to get there!The check in process was easy, quick, friendly, hassle free basically. The room they assigned me was given to me, as well as instructions for the lounge access. Entering the room had a wow factor. My previous view from the stay at the Hilton Times Square took some beating!! But this beat it!! My corner room was clean, cosy, new, and the views were amazing (see pictures). We had an issue with the TV (it simply didn’t work), being in NYC i didn’t even get round to reporting it until day 3, however when i did it was promptly fixed by maintenance.The lounge was just perfect for us at Breakfast, nothing to heavy but enough to set us up for day, free coffee and soft drinks all day long, and they did let me stock up our mini fridge with waters and diet coke (without taking advantage too much!). Again the view from the lounge while having breakfast was great, however the windows need to cleaned.Having been to NYC 3 times, the location of this hotel was perfect. Its within 15-20mins walking to main attractions, 5 mins walk to Grand Central that takes you anywhere you want to go in the city, we enjoyed the experience of the Subway. There is also a lot of little bars, shops and food places locally (not silly money like times square either) if you like a Guinness like we do :-) we found a great Irish bar called Mondoons.We had a fantastic time at Millennium Hilton Plaza, and i would like to thank you personally for making our NYC trip so amazing.

When checking in, my rate was incorrect. The front desk rep suggested that is was due to the taxes not being included in my online booking, I showed her that the taxes were included. She asked me to email my booking confirmation to the manager so that this could be corrected (this is the second time at a Hilton this has happened to me, so check your rates). She wouldn’t provide her name though, so I could jot down who I spoke to. Not a huge deal, the manager corrected this immediately, I just thought it was odd. The room didn’t contain the half bath, but instead it had a kitchenette area that contained a sink, coffee maker and what appeared to be an old in room bar/snack refrigerator. Only the bottom shelf could be used for keeping anything cool since it was designed to sell snacks and not as a true refrigerator. Upon inquiring about the room, the manager comped me 7k points since there wasn’t a room that had both a sofa bed and half bath. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good, no complaints there. I had to dispute 1 days charge for breakfast since I was charged for 1 breakfast, that was corrected at checkout. The complimentary Skyline bar, charged me $8.00 for the “complimentary” drink which was a lukewarm beer. I emailed the hotel and it was corrected. I ordered room service for my son my first night, since he was sick and we couldn’t take him out. It was basically an adult burger cut in half and overcooked so 30 plus dollars wasted.

He was amazing! As a single mom and school teacher traveling with my two girls on their dream trip to NYC but on a budget, his advice and kindness was so appreciated. One of the girls' favorite part of their trip was checking in with Mr. Barry each morning to tell him about the prior day's events and to get tips for the new one. I had to laugh when they described him as ""kinda like a grandfather but way cooler""! Our room had two double beds; it was simple and clean and the shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Being a Hilton member gave us free wi-fi which was an added savings. The entire staff was kind and helpful, from bringing us a microwave, to housekeeping providing extra cups so girls could enjoy hot coco and popcorn in room. When we spoke with Patrick Goad, the reservation manager, about how kind everyone was, he genuinely listened and appreciated our feedback. It was nice to find people who cared and were personal yet professional. ",,sulucky-blessed,0,5.0

We could see the river and the NYC skyline (Empire State & Chrysler buildings), and the sunrise and sunset every day!!! The breakfast was also worth going to. The fruit was fresh and had more berries than fillers. Even if you don't stay--forget the local Starbucks and go see Wendy in the lobby cafe for a mocha latte made with illy coffee ! She's so incredibly nice, tried to get one every day from her before we ventured out :) The gym is also great if you don't want to run outside and they have a full-size indoor tennis court.

Our biggest concern was how to protect a youngster's belief in Santa while keeping stress level to a minimum. Enter the brilliant guest-centered and creative Res Manager, Patrick Goad who understood everything immediately. We settled on a (gorgeous) 1 bedroom suite for grands and kid, plus another room for the parents. AND, so Santa could do his work in the suite without a child looking on, one add'l room for Christmas eve. All very close together. NYers for more than 3 decades, we have never experienced such spectacular views from wall to ceiling windows looking east, west and south from the suite and rooms. We had ample space for a Christmas tree, dining table, family of 5 lounging and very comfortable sofa for grandkid. We saw Empire State Bldg's light show, Chrysler etc skyscrapers in their nighttime glory, sunrise, sunset and the spectacular working East River with water taxis, barges, tugboats, yachts etc. Beds were heavenly. Coffee/tea in room much appreciated.Patrick went all out as our ""Hilton UN Christmas coordinator"" to reassure a young boy that his liaison at the North Pole had already contacted him to get the room numbers of kids staying at the Hilton instead of at home. The milk and cookies on arrival and his explanatory note sealed the deal. Santa arrived and all was wonderful.The hotel is very well located between 1st and 2nd Avenues, with buses and subways within a few blocks that can take you anywhere. Ambassador Grill in the lobby and Skyline lounge made everything easier. The UN/Grand Central neighborhood is not the jumping hot spot of the Village or SoHo. It's more reserved and business oriented. We had a worried child, harried parents and one member recovering from major surgery. The hotel staff from friendly security dogs to bellmen, to front desk (Patrick, Brendan, Nina, Teicia et al) to housekeeping--especially lovely Victoria--to restaurant and lounge staff treated us all as VIPs. Almost without exception, they all went above and beyond. Not only to give expected good service, but to reassure and understand the intangible needs of our family in somewhat stressful circumstances.This is Hilton service at its very best. Any minor deficiencies or older property issues mentioned in some (unnecessarily churlish) reviews pale in importance when the STAFF treats their GUESTS as our family was. We were so comfortable, the grandparents stayed over in the suite another day to decompress and enjoy those WINDOWS.We will definitely recommend the Millennium Hilton UN to visiting friends and family.","New York City, New York","911didnotchangeme</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",29,5.0

Raised this all with the hotel who cut away the worn carpet and made a half arsed attempt to clean the large stain.We paid £1,160 for a 2 double bed room, but they only put tea/coffee out for 2 peoplw each day even though there were 3 people staying.

A shuttle can be organised to the airport as well as private transport. The only negative of the stay was check out.

I was traveling alone with my 13yr old son. Also I would rate this as a great location, not far from Grand Central station where you can easily catch the subway. Its also within easy walking distance to the Rockefeller centre and central park. I would say its a quieter location rather than times square and if you walk along you can find cheaper supermarkets and restaurants. Ok the negatives, its sooooooooo expensive, don’t buy food or drinks here. I bought a cappuccino and it cost over $5 When we arrived it was late and we had been traveling a very long time due to delays, my son was really hungry so we ordered a pizza, it was $29 and was not very nice, I’m sure it was a frozen pizza and not fresh. Be careful of prices because the tax is added on after.When we arrived the lady on reception was not very friendly at all or welcoming! Basically got handed my room key, asked me to pay $250 and that was it, no information about the hotel or anything, we were the only people checking in at the time so she wasn’t busy. When we got to our room I had to call to ask about wifi etc, no information about the hotel facilities in the room either. The cleaning isn’t up to scratch, the dust in our room was awful! I went to make a coffee and both the cups were dirty. Felt like it needed a really good hoover and clean.

The East tower seems more dated than the West tower but both offer decently large rooms that are clean. One caution about rooms in the east tower: the mini refrigerator is in the middle of a wall, across from a mirror, and has a bright LED light that is always on (thus illuminating the room). I unplugged mine to turn the light off. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms, for the most part, are updated and clean. The tv selection is quite good (hbo go is a huge plus). The fitness center isn’t huge for the size of the hotel but has great equipment. The lounge in the west tower has the best views in the city—you can see all of Midtown/downtown, LIC, UN, bridges, etc. The food is extremely boring but the staff is so, so friendly and attentive. The lobby can be understaffed at peak times. Staff is somewhat friendly but not particularly warm. Elevators can be very messed up (I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve stepped into an elevator on the west side to have the doors close and the elevator not move). Overall this hotel is solid and not a bad choice.",,imc80,0,4.0

The hotel confirmed beforehand that they offered valet parking services for a reasonable fixed daily rate; more on this later in the review. While we were acknowledged by reception as being Diamond Members, it was only after requested that a room upgrade was offered. Unfortunately, this lack of acknowledging Diamond program benefits at check-in seems to be fast becoming the norm across Hilton properties.The upgraded higher floor room was incredible. In comparison to the size of a typical New York City hotel room, this was more than double the space. The floor to ceiling window view from the room of the nearby Chrysler Building was amazing and truly memorable. Furnishings in the room were modern and comfortable, and the touchscreen electronic lighting and air conditioner controls were quite impressive. One strange note to the room was that it had absolutely no overhead or lamp lighting near the oversized desk. The bathroom was huge with a fully tiled and glass walk-in shower.Our visit to the Executive Lounge was truly uninspiring. The lounge was open for evening refreshments and lite food for another 30 minutes when we got there on a Saturday night only to be greeted with a warning of the closing time. A minimal selection of alcoholic beverages is available for a charge, with only soda, coffee and tea being complimentary. The food selection was truly spartan as most of the serving trays were empty. We questioned the lounge staff and were once again reminded that they were closing in 25 minutes. I am sorry but you are either open or closed and we were left to feel like we were imposing on the staff. After a few crackers and celery sticks, we left in disgust.The next morning was a spectacular contrast to the night before. Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was top shelf. The many selections on the buffet were fresh and well-stocked. My wife ordered an egg white vegetable omelette that looked and tasted outstanding. The service was extremely professional and our table was very well attended to.Now getting back to the valet parking. At checkout, I was informed that there would be an extra $24 fee for oversized vehicle added to my bill. I informed the front desk that my vehicle was actually a 'compact SUV' and in no way oversized. After some back and forth between the front desk, the third party parking service and myself, they removed the charge and printed my receipt.The following day my credit card was alerted to a single charge of $24 from Hilton which initiated over a week and a half of back and forth attempts at resolution with the local Hilton staff who offered no more than an acknowledgement of the charge.Now for the happy ending. I was finally able to get my issue escalated beyond the billing department and spoke with Patrick the Reservations Manage at Millenium Hilton UN. Patrick immediately acknowledged my Diamond loyalty to Hilton and listened to the series of events leading to the call. Patrick saw my experience as a training opportunity for some of the local staff and offered to refund the parking charges in full. Customer satisfaction is sometimes a difficult task and you never get a second chance at a first impression. Patrick was instrumental in turning my experience at Millenium Hilton UN from a strong negative to a positive. I am now looking forward to staying at the Millenium Hilton UN on my next trip to the city.","Baytown, Texas","Kevin R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baytown, Texas</strong>",4,4.0

The location of the Milennium Hilton we found to be very nice! It's in close proximity to Fifth Avenue, Central Park and Grand Central Station. Also, it's just a 10 minute walk to the closest boat stop on East River (East 34th Street); this is practical if you want to go to Brooklyn or Williamsburg. We got a room on the 32nd floor. (It seems like the hotel floors start from floor 28). This means that you - most likely - will get a room with a view. We had a room facing south, with a magnificent view of East River and Manhattan. From my bed, I had a clear view of Empire State Building, which is quite a sight during night! The beds were very good, as were the bathroom facilities. Housekeeping always left our room tidy and well cleaned. On the minus side:Reception staff treated us a bit indifferent on arrival. So, the welcome was not the best. (However, this seems to be the norm at many hotels in New York City.)The playlist at the hotel bar downstairs was totally out of place, taken into consideration that you are at a hotel next to the UN. The music made us feel that we were at a bad 90s party. On the plus side: -good beds-marvellous views!-nice bathroom -good housekeeping!-very welcoming and friendly bell boys!

My almost entirely positive feelings towards this establishment were confirmed on my most recent stay. Due to circumstances beyond my control I had to postpone by two days my arrival in the city. Even though the booking was non-refundable and I was quite happy to accept this, the reservations manager at the hotel changed my booking and informed me that as the hotel was fully booked they could benefit from having a room freed up for two nights and so they would waive the charge for the two nights in question. I mention this example because the Hilton would have been justified to have charged me but staff used their discretion to treat me as a guest not just a source of revenue. Obviously, in the long run satisfied and happy customers will bring far more benefit for the hotel than the two nights they could have charged.

I can’t complaint about that, since staff assigned me a room as soon as they could. Location I really nice. Rooms have amazing view over UN building, the Hudson river and the midtown as well.Rooms are mid-size, quite well furnished with a king size bed and a chaise-longue to enjoy the view from the window. Said that, windows are quite narrow and I did expect something more. Bathroom is pretty small, very average, nothing to talk about. Toiletries from Evelyne and Crab. Service is pretty anonymous. Staff does its job without any interest in you. None of them is really dedicated to you, neither tries to anticipate your needs. As a gold member, while I got the benefits related to the tier, no one really recognized my status or made me feel really welcome. This is an area where the management should work hard. Club Lounge is old, and I mean old: it stinks, spaces are narrow and all the things saw better times. Breakfast In the lounge is just sub-par. Nothing you’d fancy of when you think of Hilton. But breakfast in the restaurant (which – by the way – costs 10$ for the upgrade as gold member) is not that better: located in the basement, while staff is ok, food selection is quite limited and could be definitely better in terms of quality. As a final note, on my folio I discovered I was mistakenly charged 2 times for the breakfast. As none gave me the receipt on check -out (they send it to you via e-mail), when I read it on my mobile I was surprised. I know mistakes may occur, so I promptly email them about the matter. Luckily they were more than professional in fixing it. It’s a pity, because the hotel is ideally located and has some very good things, but all this made my stay very mediocre and I don’t think I will stay there again.","Milan, Italy","Flyerzblog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milan, Italy</strong>",87,3.0

Personally, I was taking the weekend away to celebrate achieving some goals of mine; the Millennium Hilton made this celebration one to remember. Upon arrival which was late in the evening, the front desk agent Adina was very friendly, warm and welcoming to me; she saw that I was waiting in line and even though she must have just begun her shift and was logging in, she called me over to her desk and helped check me in. The overnight front office manager Stanley was also at the desk and greeted me kindly and enthusiastically. Come to find out, the reservations manager Patrick had upgraded my room to the Hemstead Suite - I guess he saw that I listed “celebration” as the reason for my stay when booking my queen room and really wanted me to have a celebratory experience! The Suite was immaculate and exquisite from the moment I entered the door. Two floors connected by staircase in the room with a gorgeous chandelier, double master baths each with extra large showers, spacious living room area, and the king bed on the room’s second floor with nearly floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking southern Manhattan and the East River, with direct sight of Freedom Tower/One World Trade. An amenity of wine and a handwritten card from Patrick were waiting for me in the suite wishing me a great celebratory stay; Patrick and his team went above and beyond servicing me as a guest and making sure my time in the city was enjoyable. Access to the lounge was also a part of the surprise upgrade, and I loved all of the options available. I went with the continental breakfast, but even so, the selection of muffins, pastries, beverages and other items was wide ranging and nothing was lacking. Eating breakfast in the lounge with a great view down 44th Street has its perks too.Again, this hotel is really where you want to stay if you have any reason to be in NYC. It’s within the UN complex, and with that brings a level of stature and presence that conveys “I’m here, I’m important, and I’m going to have a great stay”. Transit access is easy - just a 10 minute walk straight down 44th Street leads you directly to Grand Central Terminal, complete with subway access to virtually all points around the city (4/5/6 give you Bronx and Brooklyn via the east side of Manhattan; 7 gives you crosstown Manhattan via the newest hotspot Hudson Yards and Queens; the S shuttle takes you to Times Square where you’ll find the 1/2/3 with access to Bronx and Brooklyn via the west side of Manhattan, the N/Q/R/W with access to Brooklyn and Coney Island via Barclays Center and Queens, and the A/C/E with access to JFK on the A, downtown/World Trade Center on the E, Central Park on the C, and Penn Station on the 1/2/3/A/C/E). You can get EVERYWHERE. I never felt isolated by staying at the Hilton; rather, I felt the whole city was my playground to explore.The entire team of staff does an amazing job of making sure each guest is well taken care of. Each day of my stay, my room was serviced promptly by housekeeping with keen attention to detail. While I relaxed in the lounge, staff were always eager to make sure I was enjoying my time and always offered assistance should I need anything. Even as I was checking out and leaving the hotel, Suzy at the front desk was warm and attentive, making sure that every part of my stay had gone smoothly and that all of the billing was correct. My experience with the Millennium Hilton left me feeling refreshed and glad I had chosen to stay there for my celebration. If you are looking for wonderful comfort, with wonderful amenities and a wonderful, top-notch staff while staying in NYC, you are guaranteed to find all of that here at the Millennium Hilton One UN Plaza.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","terpswag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,5.0

One night we were not feeling well so decided to eat there and brought a 2 1/2 year-old, very well behaved child with us. The waiter acted mad and rude from the get go. We had to argue with him to get silverware and a plate for the child! There is no kids menu, and he didn’t seem to want to help with smaller portions or any adjustments for children’s food, despite being the only hotel in the restaurant. That was fine, we were willing to pay full price if we could have just got some service! The waiter never refilled our glasses or came back and asked how our food tasted, among other things. My order was not correct, but I had to eat it anyway as I could not get anyone’s attention, let alone our waiter. The restaurant was not busy that night. When I complained at the end of the meal, (which was the only time our waiter came back) about the service and the food all he said was “I’ll give you a free dessert“. The next day I went to the front desk and spoke to the very personable and nice front desk manager. He took notes and told me he would have the restaurant manager call when he came into work that day or when we got home the next day. I never got a phone call but I did get the full price of the meal refunded. That was nice but it tells me that they’re not very interested in the way the restaurant is run.This Hilton has an absolutely wonderful breakfast buffet with more items than I’ve ever seen! Everything is fresh and delicious and the service is amazing. We ate there every morning and no one at breakfast seemed to have a problem with the 2 1/2-year-old! She got silverware, drink and a chair without having to ask. Everything was refilled promptly and dirty dishes were taken away quickly. The difference between the morning service in the evening service was unbelievable!We had a beautiful room and very good maid service, but the rooms had a smell that seem to be coming from the carpet. It smelled to us like urine. I called the front desk once about it and talk to the maid another time but nothing seemed to be done. The rooms need a maintenance person to go and check them, as there are nice amenities but a lot of them don’t work. Also seems as though the upholstery and the carpet need to be cleaned.

From the doorman to the front desk, they were all pleasant and wonderful. From the first time I called this hotel to research info about the area, I spoke with Linda and she was awesome. Speaking with Linda was like talking to an old, dear friend. Because we share the same birthday and she wanted our first time in New York to be special, Linda had champagne, chocolate cake, and strawberries delivered to our room. How sweet is this? Thank you so much, Linda, and the wonderful staff at the Millennium UN. Your service was seamless and exceptional! That being said, I'm very disappointed to share my family's experience in regards to the accommodations at this hotel. With such a great staff there, I believe this location is in need of a renovation. The building has somewhat of a musty odor, along with worn and stained carpet throughout. The lobby furniture appears to be dated and stained as well. Our room was on the 28th floor. While we appreciated the view of New York, we were not fond of the spiral staircase, as the staircase was rather tall and steep. The carpet on the stairs was not clean as well as areas in the room. Having teenagers who hated the stairs because of how steep they were can be very telling. One of my daughters said the stairs gave her anxiety and this was her least favorite hotel to stay at. And while the kids had their own bathroom downstairs, they had to climb the stairs each night to shower (there isn't a shower downstairs). In addition, rooms at this hotel are not equipped with a microwave and they do not have ice machines like traditional hotels. Also, there is no option to receive a complimentary breakfast like other traditional hotels. However, we knew about the breakfast option going in. Lastly, (IF) I could rate the customer service at this hotel alone, I'd give this location a 5-star rating. However, by a family vote, I'm giving this Hilton property a 3-star rating (and not because of the staff!)Hilton, you can do better than this!",,destination-woman,1,3.0

What a nice greeting. I felt the front desk were very entitled about their mediocre hotel. After waiting for 15minutes she notioned that I was allowed to come. Before this, we had booked and paid for the hotel in Finland, my manager sent several emails and driver license pictures to the front desk person for me to avoid having to use my own credit card upon arrival. Despite this, the front desk refused to give us our room so we were forced to pay for the entire stay with my credit card (including a 200dollar deposit).What followed was about 20 emails, 4 phone calls from Finland to confirm the old credit card, about 4 front desk workers, and none of them helped me get my charge back. Finally I contacted my bank, and they said I would get it back the next day, after showing the receipt for the hotel. This was 2 weeks later.We stayed in a suite around on the 31st floor and the view was great. However, the room was fully carpeted and very dusty. The furnitures were worn out. There was a noodle (piece of food) in the minifridge, which I complained about twice and it never disappeared. There was splashes of liquid stains on the walls, and they didnt disappear even though I complained about the dirtiness of the suite. I took a piece of paper and water and tested if they can come off, which was possible, so it was just due to laziness. The bed was fine and I slept ok.The suite did not have a very large room height. It felt like around 6'6feet or 2 meters in many places, a bit claustrophobic even for a 5'8 foot/170cm guy.The bathroom shower handle was loose. The windows were semi-dirty, which ruined the view a bit, which was otherwise nice.The coffee machine had an absolute gross, green water holder, which I complained about, but which never got cleaned. And so I never used the coffee machine.The breakfast was good buffet-style, and the chef made good omelettes.The hotel had 3 elevators from which 2 broke down, and it took us a 10minute wait to get downstairs to eat break fast.The TV was sufficient, but they had an automatic log-out every day at 11am. And when it was thundering outside we were watching a movie from netflix and it got shut and logged out at 11, and we had to input our login credentials again to continue, which was frustrating. ( I know, 1st world problems, but not expected from a 400dollar/night room).I do not recommend this hotel.","New York City, New York","NikHreviews</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,2.0

With only 10 hours from touchdown at JFK to my event, I opted to stay at the UN Plaza for proximity and to optimize on sleep. I hoped to use the morning for extra sleep or breakfast, rather than on flagging a cab during NYC rush hour and commuting from another hotel. After a long journey, all I wanted at midnight was a hot shower. But no, that simple requirement was too much. I filled the (small) bath but got tepid water. Shivering, I tried the shower. No better. I let the water run, I tried running the tap in the sink too (hoping to kickstart heating somewhere, while feeling guilty about wasting water!). Nothing. When I called housekeeping, I got the operator who said he’d send someone “to show me how to use the shower”!! That was patronising and deflected fault from them to me, which is ridiculous. As a middle-aged frequent traveler, I’ve handled hotels and showers across 50+ countries: “it’s not me it’s you”. Someone checked it out, agreed it was cold, thought it might have been wrongly installed, yet said there was nothing he could do and would let the front desk know. They called and sent someone else, who tried his best and managed to reset it by 10 degrees, to a temperature still less than the minimum temperature required by NY regulations for landlords. All this while, I’d been browsing for other hotel rooms because in addition to this issue, the room was freezing even after switching off the air conditioning. When all you want is a hot shower and sleep, and can’t get that at a hotel you paid almost $500 for, you’d even consider moving at 1am after a very long journey! I was too exhausted, and finally opted to settle for the slight improvement rather than wander NY at that hour. Having wasted so much time, I thought I’d order breakfast through room service as a “wake up call” to ensure I didn’t miss my meeting. Guess what? No room service menu in the room, no breakfast card to hang on the door. I tried calling room service, no response to several calls. I then tried checking the TV for a menu, and they only had options for dinner (5-11pm) and nothing else. No late night service, no breakfast options. This is a hotel whose main reason for existence is the United Nations next door, with diplomats and international travelers arriving and departing round the clock, and they don’t cater outside of 5-11pm?? This makes no sense. Other issues: there was a cavity where a fridge/mini bar should been, and a “potential door” propped up behind it (images attached). There’s tea/coffee sachets, no kettle, no spoons, no creamers or sugar, no bottles of water. No bathrobe, no slippers, no stationery, nothing. This is the room time forgot. There’s a sign on the 37th floor saying it’s under renovation. You only see this when you exit the elevator. Nothing in the lobby, no mention at check in, and certainly nothing on the website, let alone a reasonable price to compensate. Yet, so many of these issues stem from neglect rather than a botched/incomplete renovation effort.I’ve never stayed in a hotel this expensive, yet got so little. I’ve stayed at Travelodges and cheap motels during sold out conferences like SXSW and got better amenities and service. This is a cruel, cruel joke. Except it isn’t remotely funny. I will never use the Hilton again, anywhere, on principle. This is unacceptable. I need to stay another night after all, but I’m glad I didn’t extend till I got here. I’ll give my business to absolutely anywhere rather than this. I now have 5 hours before my UN meeting, so that’s shot too. Thanks, Hilton!! You can have 2* for the location that I needed, but it was a fail on every other count. Shocking.",,intrepid365,0,2.0

I stayed at this hotel because I had a transit in NYC in the middle of a long trip. I hate to say this but the bellmen at this Millennium Hilton hotel were all worst than any of the Uber or cab drivers that helped me along the way. The front desk was also no better.I arrived late afternoon, and after I got off my Uber, a bellman saw me but pretended he didn't see me. I had to wave at him to get him to help me with my suitcases. I had four suitcases. He asked me ""you need help?"" Well yes obviously! He then walked to me very slowly with his cart with an unhappy face. Afterwards, he slammed my suitcases onto the cart, with wheels down. He pushed the cart into the lobby (literally 10m distance). While I was checking in, he interrupted me and told me his job is done, that someone else would help me take everything to my room if I needed it. I thanked him, but he didn't walk away. He continued standing there. At that moment, the front desk associate helping me check him said to me, ""Robert has helped you, and his job is only until here"". I nodded and turned my head to thank the bellman again. He still wouldn't leave. The front desk associate then said, ""he helped you, so..."" This was when I realized that both of them were expecting me to tip the bellman. I really did not want to tip anything because I didn't like the service, but I was obligated to do so! I took out a $1 note and gave it to him, and he frowned and still didn't move. I ignored him completely from then on and he finally left. I asked the front desk if any upgrades were available as I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, he just shucked his head without even checking the screen. I am very sure there are still available rooms for an upgrade because I booked my room on the day (only a couple hours before my arrival) and I saw all sorts of rooms still available for booking. Even if everything is really sold out, I would expect the associate to look into possibilities first before relentlessly turning me down. Furthermore, I did call the hotel right after I made the booking (so around midday) to ask if they could upgrade me, and the person who answered the phone said they will, and that I will get it during check in. The person I spoke to on the line was also a lot more polite than the person helping me at the front desk. The next morning as I was leaving, I brought all four pieces of luggage down to the ground level. This hotel has two wings and the wing I stayed at is a short distance away from the concierge. Three bellmen walked past me and no one offered to help me with my luggages. All in all, I couldn't understand why all the staff working at this hotel seemed very unhappy. Every Uber driver that I came across during the trip would voluntarily leave their car seats to help me load and unload luggages, with a big smile on their faces. I felt very sad that I booked a Hilton property and felt less welcomed by the staff there than the Uber drivers. The front desk even pressured me to tip when he clearly did not know what kind of service I had experienced. I will not stay at this hotel again, and I do not recommend anyone who cares about service and hospitality to come here.","New York City, New York","Lin D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,1.0

While the views are still spectacular, the property itself has not aged very well. The now historic glass and mirror lobby, seemingly untouched, still gives the impression that you have entered a 1980's discotheque (not that this is necessarily a bad thing!). It was disappointing to see lackadaisical maintenance in public areas, e.g., lobby and hallway carpeting was extensively stained. The narrow room corridors, festooned in charcoal gray wallpaper, had a somewhat foreboding, prison-like quality. And, room service trays, carts and random glasses and dishes scattered throughout the hallways did not help. My tastefully renovated room on the 32nd floor, decent size by New York standards, was clean but very basic and mostly unremarkable. It took quite awhile for the room to cool down. The bed was comfortable yet unadorned. The tight bathroom was not at all luxurious with a compact toilet and bathtub. The illuminated makeup mirror was a nice touch.Service was merely adequate. I arrived before I could check-in so I left my small suitcase with the bellman. When I tried to retrieve it later, the bell staff was first unable to find it. Needless to say, I began to panic. They even asked me to help them look for it in the storage closet!

Disappointed, as we were visiting New York on a special occasion (our silver wedding anniversary), I went back to the lobby and spoke to Taricia (I think that was her name). She was super helpful and got us a much larger room in the front building facing the New York skyline. What a treat!All in all everyone of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Here are a few tips to make your stay even better:Get a Hilton’s Honours membership (very easy to set up via your mobile). You get lots of perks, like free WiFi in your room, late check out (1pm) etc. The breakfast in the hotel is too expensive (even for New York standards). However, they have a coffee shop downstairs in the lobby which is open from six every morning and offers delicious pastries and coffee to take away (or to our room to have breakfast in bed every morning!) Marvellous! If you fancy a more substantial breakfast or want to experience a proper New York Diner, visit John’s Diner on the corner of 44th street and 2nd Ave. Their special omelette with home fried potatoes or their granola with Greek Yoghurt and fresh fruit are amazing!If you have a late flight home like us, don’t bother getting a late checkout, which can set you back $100 to keep your room until 4pm. The reception will store your luggage for you and will give you a key to the restrooms to freshen up or get changed. We definitely would stay at the Millennium Hilton One UN Plaza again! Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so special!","Bromley, Kent","NewEur0pean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bromley, Kent</strong>",8,5.0

The BathroomThe bathroom got a bathtub and it was clean. Big mirrors and overall it was a nice clean bathroom. Restaurant/EntertainmentThere is a cafe on site where you can get coffee and light pastries. Hotel Service/AmenitiesStaff was not friendly at all. We are staying at Hilton and more than ever it was right next to the UN Plaza, you would expect the staff was friendly but oh boy that was not the case. Wifi was not free in the room but free in public areas. Although, if you are a Hilton member you can get free wifi in the room. This is where the staff was unfriendly, so I called the concierge and told him that I am a member and I would like to know how to get the free wifi service in room. The concierge was talking really fast but I understand him perfectly. I was telling him that it didn't work and then he asked for my membership number and etc, in the end, he was just telling me to call the customer service to rectify my account (ridiculous just for wifi) Then my husband called again and the same thing happened to him. He was not happy so he went down instead to prove that we are members and this should be an easy process, if not what's the point of being a member? So the staff was telling him reasons why and then we said what's the point of being a member if your system doesn't recognize our membership? then the guy was maybe fed up and he just gave the code but he didn't look happy. I found this very unprofessional. I used to work in the hotel industry and I do deal with annoying customers but If I was in the staff shoes that were not acceptable both the concierge and whoever my husband spoke to. Furthermore, we were there during Christmas week, where tourist are everywhere and the staff were unfriendly at all.

Originally the reservation was only for my husband and I but due to some last minute changes we had to bring the kids along. I emailed the hotel to find out if they could add the kids on to our existing reservation without us having to cancel and rebook and they did it with no problems. When we arrived we were greeted by one of the bellmen and he was very nice. Asked us where we were from and even joked with my husband telling him that he looked like one of the famous basketball players. The bomb sniffing dog was a treat too. I forgot his name but we were allowed to pet him. He was so adorable. We arrived at the hotel a little before 2 and even though I knew check in was at 4 I decided to go up to the desk to see if any rooms were available. To my surprise they did have a room ready and we were able to go directly upstairs. We were on the 28th floor and the view was absolutely amazing. I had requested an upgrade for a 2 bedroom but it wasn’t available. That didn’t even matter because our king suite was just like a 2 bedroom in my eyes. The living room had a pullout sofa bed, an awesome view for the kids and they even had their own bathroom and closet space. There was also a mini fridge in there. The master bed room had a good view as well with our own bathroom and closet. Omg and the heated toilet seats...never thought I would say this but they were so much fun lol! Clearly we don’t get out much because it was our first time seeing heated toilet seats with all the other great features and even had a remote for it. I believe the next day was when I got a knock at the door and someone brought up a tray with a small bottle of wine, some macaroons, and a card that said happy birthday. Absolutely blown away by this. Even though my birthday wasn’t until the 25th. It shows they took the time to acknowledge that and send up a treat. Hilton hotels are the only hotels I stay at and I’ve never gotten this before even when I told them I came to celebrate a special occasion. This hotel gets my stamp of approval.

Never felt unsafe walking anywhere in Manhattan, although we were back before midnight. 55min walk to the Met Museum alongside Central Park gives an idea of scale to first time visitors. If using Yellow Cabs, do not expect any conversation with drivers, the attitude is generally that they are doing you a favour, you will also need the street number and nearest avenue number/name where you want to be dropped. Beds were large and very comfortable, housekeeping efficient. Decent, but very expensive breakfast available, we just grabbed a coffee and pastry from the good coffee bar in the (small) lounge most days, cost around 10USD. You might want to find another place to stock up with water or juice as the pricing was comical, ( 4USD for small water).

We needed a room with two beds or a separate sleeping / living area. I went downstairs to reception to get this sorted. Not particularly friendly reception staff. However, I then met Patrick who had dealt with my reservation. He showed me the original ""double double"" room I had booked and clearly it did not have the view or the amenities of the room we had been allocated with its view of the Chrysler Building or Empire State Building. The suite was not available, however we had a lovely room with a pull out sofa which housekeeping made up for us each day. We were also given complimentary access to the Executive Lounge where we had continental breakfast and drinks / canapes in the evening.

We walked the nighbourhod (UN; 10 mins walk to Grand Central terminal etc) amd returned at 14:00 - to be told that check-in time for this hotel is 16:00. We changed our day-plan (and finally checked in late afternoon). Watch-out: the official check-ou time of this hotel is 11:00 am!We were quite surprised that we got a junior suite upon check-in - nothing of that two-floor room with its nice warm colours and the view I had booked. That room was `not available` but this one was presented as an ""equivalent"" - it did have a separate sitting room and a `kitchenette` built into a wardrobe. Unfortunately it didn't have the view I was hoping for - the view from the bedroom was straight against the façade of the hotel`s other wing (""UN DC 1"") . Now, from THAT one there IS a view of the UN, its gardens, the East River and Queens as you can see from the hotel`s gym which is in the UN DC1 wing. When you book and want a view, ask for the UN 1 wing.The mentioned `gym`: friends of mine who stayed here before told me ahead that their nice pool (with a view!) was closed for good, so I went for the gym. There is no other connection between the wings than through the (dark) lobby, which can be a bit of a nuisance but `ok`, except that when you return you do so pitch-wet and sweaty after a full work-out, as that gym has no showers - whatsoever. Incredible! What is also quite surprising: the gym has just 7 cardio-equipments (3 treadmills, 2 bikes and 2 elliptical walkers) and a few weightlifting items) and is rater small for a hotel this huge of a size, but it has a stunning 149 lockers in the male changing room only. I suppose another 150-or-so in the female locker as well, and I wonder why so many as all cardio-equipments were already full on a Saturday morning at 09:00. My `take` is that the gym is open to hotel-external non-guests as well, and I don't dare to imagine a busy Thursday after-office time in-there.Skip the breakfast in the windowless ""Ambassador Grill"" - not worth the price (of 39++). In summary: it is kind-of `ok-ish` if you don't expect too much, but you should ask for a definite view in the DC one-building ahead of time.","Marne-la-Vallee, France","antan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marne-la-Vallee, France</strong>",41,3.0

Sadly this was not to be the case. We arrived at the hotel at around 5 pm, no wait to be checked in. We were checked in by Avery, and what a ""jolly"" fellow he was (please note the sarcasm) Don't think I've ever met a more surly front of house individual in my life. I asked if he had my HH details on screen before I could finish my sentence he responds ""yes but you won't get your points as you booked through a third party"". this was delivered with an almost ""ha ha"" type attitude all without looking up from his screen. ""ok, can you see the details of the complaint I had with Hilton"" again curtly response of ""no sorry"". In addition to his poor manner, he looked like he had slept in his coat! Off we went to our room and both agreed this was not a great start, we walked in and low and behold, the upgraded room had not been given, we were in a dark room with a tiny window on the 37th floor. I called down to the desk, and got Avery, ""Hi there you've just checked us in and we were due to have an upgrade"" I said quite politely. ""no, your booking was for a double room"" I was told. I then explained the email chain with Stanley, his response, ""well I've not got any corner rooms"" sigh. ""ok I'll come down and we can discuss"" I said, now getting a bit annoyed with his attitude. Surprise, surprise he had vanished. I explained the issue to another member of the front of house team who was perfectly pleasant, saw the issue and rectified quickly and professionally, and magically had a corner room that Avery had said you didn't have, so not only was he rude, but he lied to us. I wanted to raise this, but my partner just wanted to enjoy our trip. The hotel lobby is quite small and feels like a train station waiting room, there is a small coffee shop serving snacks and drinks. We felt as we were not wearing suits we really didn't matter to the staff, we both agreed that we have never felt so invisible in a hotel in our lives. Breakfast is $42.50 each, so we eat out every day. Our corner room was spacious with a great TV and amazing views, the water was not always as hot as it could be. The room was kept clean.

We were booked for a two-night getaway to celebrate a special occasion. Unfortunately, mother nature decided to strike and give us lots of snow, which ended up with cancelled flights and our plans for a weekend away were also cancelled.We originally did an advanced purchase for our room (And yes, we understand the refund policy that was stated). My first interaction with the front desk manager was at 6pm, I explained everything that happened and asked if she could move my reservation that was for 3/2/19 to 3/16/19. She quickly brushed my concerns away but said, ""You are all set. I will change your reservation. You will receive an email with your new reservation. We look forward to seeing you."" I was ecstatic. After waiting two hours and still no email, I decided to call and check on my reservation. The rep. told me my reservation was still for 3/2/19. I called the hotel directly and again was told my reservation was 3/2/19 and had not been changed. This is when everything went downhill.I spoke to the front desk manager again around 9pm and asked what had happened. She gave me the typical advanced booking policy and told me there was nothing that could be done. She then refused to talk to me and only wanted to speak to “The one that holds the Hilton Gold Status”. I have worked in hospitality for over ten years, majored in hospitality, and know exactly how stressing the job could be. I simply asked why she could not call me to let me know my reservation could not be changed. Common courtesy would have just been to call me and let me know that due to my advanced booking, I would have to speak to Hilton advanced booking personally. What a disaster it would have been had I checked into the hotel on 3/16 with no real reservation. Her attitude and her unwillingness to be understanding and help really put into perspective that the hotel does not care about their customers. It is a shame that we do not want to stay at this beautiful Hilton hotel anymore.Even after all of that, my representative from advanced bookings understood that my safety was much more important than a hotel booking. Thankfully he was able to refund my room, after only he was given a hard time by the front desk manager as well.",,Vivi0328,1,1.0

The hotel elevator and lobby have nothing to do with the office people. The hotel has a lounge for those who are entitled to use it under their Hilton honors standing, or who pay for access. The neighborhood is completely United Nations.The plusses: very kind staff (everybody), perfectly clean, beautiful views of the East River or parts of the city, depending on where your room is. The lounge was very nice, and I had no problem with the $5 charge for a glass of wine or a beer at happy hour. But I'm not sure how I would feel about paying extra for the lounge.The minuses: the decor feels dated, at least in the room we were given and in the common areas. The neighborhood is really the UN, and has an office-area feel. There's not a lot right there that would interest a tourist. If you like to walk, it is walkable enough to Grand Central Station and many other things noted in other reviews, and that is more valuable in the warmer weather and when the daylight hours are longer.

However, in the tower facing Manhattan, corner does not give that much extra, standard room would be sufficient. * the other tower is older when it comes to interior and has less bathroom amenities, older bathroom with tub (instead of modern shower) and less modern air conditioning - but still good quality - the Continental Breakfast for gold members in the sky Lounge is ok but no better - windows are always dirty, otherwise the rooms are clean - all staff is very friendly. Only the staff at the reception gives you almost permanently the impression you would be an annoyance - only exception is Brandon, he really makes you feel like he cares and is very engaged. - restaurant is expensive and not the best.

I let him know he should ask in future and not just barge in. On my check out day - far ahead of check out time the cleaning staff also knocked 10 times in a row very loudly on the door and when I answered I asked why she had to knock like that - she said she has to knock loudly to know if we are there and spoke in a very harsh tone to me. Very unfriendly, very rude, very intrusive - my experience was not pleasant as a result. One last person came to the door just before I was to check out to see if I needed a coffee refill and this person knocked in a normal manner and was very polite so it seems some staff are well trained and others are not and would benefit from support from their management to make guests feel comfortable and welcome. I would have given 5 stars as property is nice and clean and as some staff are also kind, polite and friendly - but the feeling of intrusion by the person delivering a package and harsh and rude tone of cleaning staff made my stay extremely unpleasant overall.

The hotel was OK. I have stayed there on more than one occasion. However on my short 2 night stay this time I had some issues. The first night I went to the Executive Lounge for light snacks. However, the lounge was closed due to a private event. As a concession, the hotel offered 50% off on a meal at the hotel restaurant. Not complimentary like the Executive lounge would have been but I did get a decent meal--but ended up spending $40 nonetheless (I ended up double tipping--as I did not notice that a gratuity was auto-added to the bill for a single diner (me) until after I paid and got back to the room). That was bothersome, but shortly afterwards the fire alarm sounded. False alarm in the end--but about 10 minutes of a lot of noise and drama wondering whether I was going to have to walk down 29 floors. The 2nd night I was awoke by knocking at the room door--2x. The first time, the security guard (or one who said he was) wanted to know if everything was alright. Asked about whether water was leaking in the room. I said all was ok.

There is a little breakfast shop that had Ily coffee and various pastries that I’d rate a 10. The highlight of the room, however, was the corner room views of the river and the bathroom.

The rooms, while charmless, are serviceable. Recent renovations have been successful, on balance. And for those doing business at the UN, the location is unbeatable.The weak point: the staff - deplorable by what used to be Hilton standards. And the hotel is so nakedly revenue-driven as to chase away any sense of actual service or customer loyalty. The restaurant serves an over-priced, altogether synthetic and unoriginal, breakfast.Whatever happened to Hilton? It used to be a terrific business brand, its international properties often genuinely luxurious and stylish. The Conrad collection or the sprawling Hilton brand now aspires (without much success) to those laurels internationally, but Hilton itself, domestically in the US, is increasingly pedestrian.

So we tried to change to the correct room category, that we already paid for, but the rude lady at the front desk refused to help us again. Since I was too tired after a long-haul flight to discuss this with the manager, we had to sleep the first night in an uncomfortable queen bed, which is way too small for two people!

I thought he meant where so I said JFK airport so he yelled WHEN??? WHAT DAY??I was shocked what kind of a hotel service is this who gave him the job? Couldn’t he just ask polity “is it for today?” Or clarify nicely “I meant to ask what day?” I know this is not the Four Seasons hotel but does it mean you have abuse your guests because they don’t pay as much as those of a 5* hotel?!English is not my first language but I lived in an English speaking country long enough to know that if I say I have an appointment at 3 it’s 99.9% I am talking about today unless I specifically mention the name of the day.Or Did I have to tip him first as I approach him to get a smile and respect ?

I had already checked-in online and selected a room and it was ready for me despite my early arrival. Maybe I'm not New York City material, but being asked to put an extra $100 deposit on hold from my credit card took me aback a bit. Not my first surprise while in the city though. The room wasn't far from the elevators and had a very nice view from the window onto the East River and directly down onto the United Nations. The room I was in was larger than most, mainly due to its location - it was about 1.5x larger than what you would expect as you can likely see in the pictures I'm posting with the review. The long window along the wall gave a great view during the day and even moreso at night. Things I liked about the room included the flooring in the bathroom which was never cold even when I had the A/C turned up. Things I didn't like? The Illy Coffee-Espresso maker in the room. It was terrible and wouldn't make a complete Espresso or coffee unless you played with it and pushed the buttons repeatedly. Filling it with water was a bit tricky as well as the reservoir didn't want to come off and I worried I was going to break it (and buy it!). The plug in the bathroom sink wouldn't come completely up either, so I could only run water there slowly as the sink wouldn't drain as fast as water filled it. It took quite a while for the water to turn hot enough to shave as well, especially at a trickle. Speaking of hot water - there are very nice bags of tea available to you on the coffee bar, but no way to boil water for them...unless you want to trickle hot water in the sink for about 20 minutes or so first. The TV was first rate and I liked that extra streaming channels like Crackle were included; Netflix is also there but you have to sign into your own personal account to view anything. The bed was comfortable, no complaints there and ultimately that is the point of a hotel - to have somewhere to sleep. The alarm clock provided was an iHome brand oriented towards Apple products, but if you have a USB cord you can connect other devices to it as well. With the location of the hotel and the branding, I expected much more than I found here. It was still a comfortable stay and if in town again for business in the same area I would book again.","Clinton Township, Michigan","michiganmike64</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clinton Township, Michigan</strong>",16,3.0

We came to NYC for our anniversary as well as my wife's birthday.For our stay we were located in room 3131 which was a gorgeous and spacious two bedroom suite. I would have to say that one of the many highlight of this particular suite was the sweeping views of not only the East River but Midtown Manhattan as well, especially the One World Trade Center and Chrysler/Empire State buildings. Besides the vies, this suite was extremely spacious and main living area consisted of a large circular dining table, built-in coffee/mini bar area, a desk and chair, lounging chair with ottoman, wall-mounted t.v., two chaise loungers a coffee table and more. The main living area also had a wall mounted digital/touchscreen unit which controlled not only the HVAC for the main area and bedroom but as well as the lighting for the whole well which was divided into zones. The master bedroom was equally large and had flanking wardrobes at the entrance with ample pull-out shelving and hangers, a king-size bed as well as a bench at the foot of the bed. The views from the bedroom were just as great as the main living area. The master ensuite was luxurious to say the least - large soaker tub and glass enclosed walk-in shower with multiple shower heads including a rain shower head. The ensuite also had a dressing/makeup table and of course a single vanity. The Skyline Club which was located on the 30th floor, was where continental breakfast and evening snacks were served. Breakfast consisted of cubed cheese, bagels and breads, an assortment of pastries, yogurt, cereal, granola, jams/spreads, juice, coffee, milk and fruit. In the evening, the lounge offered small bites such as cheese, bread, pretzels, veggies and dips and some warm items such as chicken wings and crispy deep friend beans. The selection of food items change daily so the aforementioned menu was what we encountered during our 3 night stay. The lounge also offered wine and beer for an additional cost. The other option for breakfast would be to visit the Ambassador Grill restaurant on the main lobby level of the hotel. This is a full buffet spread with just about anything you can imagine. There is a fee for this breakfast option. Similarly, there is also Un Cafe on the main level as well which serves snacks, sandwiches and salads as well as crafted coffee beverages.Location wise, you're Midtown East area and within walking distance to Central Park, Empire and Chrysler Building, Times Square as well as the iconic Grand Central Terminal. All in all, we loved our stay at the Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza and will definitely stay again when we return. The staff we had contact with was amazing - super friendly, always willing to help out and above all, very hospitable. The suite was probably one of the nicest rooms I've ever come across at a Hilton property and I'd highly recommend it if you are looking for a bit (lot) of extra space.","Toronto, Canada","Stephen B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

The Staff at the front desk was excellent and incredibly helpful. We were able to check into our room early because they had one ready, but they were also willing to have our luggage held and delivered to our room if we had needed it. Unfortunately, we had less than stellar service from others. We called three mornings to have ice delivered to the room (they do not have self-service ice machines or vending machines available). We only got the ice one morning in a reasonable time. One morning it had not come after 45 minutes and I called to cancel because we were leaving. The other morning is took nearly as long, but I had learned my lesson and called really early. THe location is definitely great for the UN or business travel. It is also great if a view is what you are looking for while in your room. It was our first trip to New York, so we knew we wanted a nice room with a view. We got a corner room and out one window we could see the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Out the other window was the River and grounds of the UN. Definitely no complaints about the view. It was a bit of a trek to the nearest subway, basically you had to go to Grand Central Terminal to get anywhere. There was another line a little north, but no matter what it was a half mile or more walk.The room was comfortably sized and in good shape. The bathroom was very nice. The main issue we had was rowdy neighbors. You could hear every word they said and especially when they had been drinking a while. The other main issue was smell from their cologne made its way into our room and lingered for a while, which was very annoying.Overall, I think this makes a better business hotel than family or romantic hotel. The view can be incredible with the right category of room, but that is the main thing going for the hotel.

It is a great location although there's a bit of a walk to the nearest subway stop. Our train from upstate NY got us to the hotel a bit before 2 o'clock. It is a huge hotel but there were only 2 people working the front desk, so we waited nearly half an hour before we finally got taken care of, only to be told that we could only access our room at 4 pm. We had another wait for the bell boy where we left some of our luggage so we could start visiting New York City. It's a bit outrageous to have only two people manning the front desk at a hotel this size. Later when we returned, it was the same situation, so we again had to wait to get our keys. It's also outrageous to let people in no sooner than 4 pm when most hotels in NYC will let you in before 3 pm. One other complaint is that you can only get free WiFi if you agree to join Hilton Honors (which is free), otherwise it is $9.95. This said, our room, on the 29th floor, was stupendous! Very clean and spacious with a gorgeous view of the East River. Because it was so high, it was very quiet and the street noise did not reach us. The bathroom had a Japanese toilet, very much fun.

The issues that we had were rectified, however without those issues probably I would have rated the hotel excellent (so let's see a next time if the issues will not happen again).Also, the fitness center should have more cardio equipment, there is plenty of space that can be used for more equipment, in the morning lines form to get on the equipment.The executive lounge is great, the first 3 days Igor took really good care of his, and so did his colleague the 2 days after that.

Linda was absolutely fantastic in helping us figure out accommodations that would work for my husband, 2 kids, and in-laws and deserves kudos for her outstanding customer service. Sheldon was a huge help in getting the rooms booked. Abu, in the Ambassador Grill during the buffet breakfast, was great with my son.First the good: We were in a corner suite facing the East river and downtown Manhattan, and the views were absolutely stunning. We had a very good view of the fireworks, especially the first few minutes before things got a little smokey. The suite was spacious with 2 bathrooms, a pull-out queen sofa-bed in the living room, and both a king bed and large ottomon in the bedroom. The location of the hotel is also nice, about 10-15 minute walk to Grand Central. Housekeeping was great, and the Illy espresso in the hotel coffee shop was tasty. They let us check out an hour late so we got to enjoy one last quick trip up to Rockefeller Center before catching a cab to the airport.The bad: There were so many small annoying things that they quickly added up to an overall ""meh"" stay for us in an otherwise nice suite in a good location. 1) Even though the website advertises refrigerators in the rooms, there was no fridge in our suite. This was extremely problematic for us as our son takes an injection medicine that needs to be refrigerated. The gentleman in housekeeping told me all the fridges were ""sold out"" and then proceeded to argue with me about what was stated on the website regarding the availability of fridges. After I showed the representative at the front desk the webpage and explained our situation, they managed to find us a fridge in ""another location"" in the hotel. Unfortunately, that fridge stopped working after a day and a half and the hunt was on for a replacement. I asked for a bucket of ice to be sent up to keep my son's medicine cold since there are no ice machines on the floor but was told after waiting 20 minutes that they were also out of ice buckets and were trying to find a suitable container. The replacement fridge didn't seem to be working either, but it turned out the outlet the fridge was plugged into was faulty, the 2nd bad outlet we found in the room. 2) Elevators are extremely slow. One time we got in an elevator to go downstairs, only to discover the light for the lobby wouldn't light up; it took us to a floor below the lobby and then back up to the 33rd floor, where we had to get out and wait another 5-10 minutes for another elevator.3) The phone in our suites stopped working on our 3rd day of our stay.4) We were directed to the Sky Lounge to print our our boarding passes, but the lounge was keycard access only and there was no doorbell. We had to wait outside for someone else to leave in order to get in.5) While having an Illy coffee maker w/ espresso pods in the room was nice, the machine did not consistently put out warm coffee.6) Wifi was spotty. 7) We had to ask a couple of times for the vouchers for breakfast that came with our room. First we were told that they would be delivered to our room, but when they didn't materialize, we had to go downstairs to ask again.8) Double beds are more like large singles, too small to accommodate 2 regular sized adults. To be fair, Linda warned ust this might be an issue when we made our reservation. We ended up having our son sleep on the ottoman and our daughter on the sofa-bed so our in-laws could have their own beds in their room.Not sure we'd stay here again on future trips to Manhattan, mainly because of the refrigerator issue but also because of all the many little problems we encountered.",Oviedo,"Linda L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oviedo</strong>",5,3.0

My wife and I arrived after a long flight from London, waited some 12-13minutes outside, nobody came out and there was NOBODY to greet.

I walked up, still no face contact or a ""hi"". Stood for 2 minutes, said hi to them and asked if they are OPEN. Proceeded for check-in, once done, again no door service to the room. Mind you, we had 5 bags including 1 carry on. And their excuse for no one at the door was because it was late and they were busy with another guest, I laughed out loud (sure I was there for some 15minutes to notice if any). After checking out, I ran into one of their managers and told him about the incident. I was surprised he acted ""oh, I don't care"" attitude and said we are short staffed.

We had a room on 38th floor and another on 39th and were amazed by the views. Our first trips to NYC didn't know which side of Manhattan to stay in, this side was perfect for us, quieter at night, close to grand central and 10 minutes to Times Square. The rooms were OK, super comfy beds and pillows, nice en suite. Some staff really friendly, others not so much. Rooms cleaned and fresh towels daily. We didn't have the breakfast as other reviewers had commented that it was poor value and quality.Now for the down side........no fridge or water in the rooms, a coffee machine was provided with two coffee pods per day, but no water to fill the coffee machine, so we resorted to buying a few bottles from a local shop. There was a mini bar fridge, but for some ridiculous reason it was not plugged in so I couldn't even keep any fresh milk for the coffee, and none was provided.We weren't given the code for the free wifi initially so asked at reception the following day and were then given the code.All in all I'd rate 4/5 because of the drinks situation. 1 black coffee per day, per person, is really not good enough when considering the daily rates charged for the hotel, and it's a real shame that they let themselves down by being stingy with coffee and water.

The room was quite basic but very clean, beds were super comfortable and I slept really well every night. The view of the City was mind blowing, Chrysler Building and the Empire State, look left and you can see the WTC. If I have any complaint it would be that there was no fridge in the room, disappointing as not all people like espresso and some need milk in their coffee. Also two coffees per day for two people is not enough, maybe put milk sachets with the coffee. There was a mini bar fridge but it wasn’t plugged in and had a sign saying not to put anything in it. Oh and being charged €7 for a bottle of water.. Come on Hilton this is just not on, shouldn’t have to go down 38 floors in the middle of the night to get get water from a shop around the corner for $1.I recommend Johns cafe just up road for breakfast. Service and food were fantastic great prices too. If I’m NYC again I would consider staying here again.

We contacted the hotel after booking and they gave us exactly what we required. The hotel is situated approx 15-20 minutes walk from Times Square. Grand Central 10 minutes. Supermarkets and restaurants 2-5 minutes. Perfect if you want a quiet location. We was given a room on the 36th floor in the west tower (city facing) and the views were unbelievable. The rooms are big, clean and the beds are very very comfortable. Our 3 year old has cried wanting to go back “to his hotel room” since we landed at Manchester, England. We entered our room to welcome cakes and birthday cards for our son. An extra special touch they didn’t need to do. I can’t recommend this hotel enough.

To be able to see the WTC, Hudson River, part of Liberty island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler, the Met Life, the Con Edison and the lights from Times Square was worth the expense.

The beds are very comfortable with mattresses on the softer side. The King room we had also had a wide sofa which was a more firm cushion and could easily be used as a second bed if needed. The bathrooms in this hotel are very spacious as well, and the 'fun' toilets make you think more of overseas establishments. The rooms, as pointed by others, gather an incredible amount of dust, and it is unclear why. So our room was dust-free in the AM, but by evening, a visible layer of dust had covered all surfaces, such that we could draw out distinct artwork in the dust. I actually think they do an exceptional job at housekeeping, to remove that dust every morning. I found the hotel exceptionally clean.The view from the room we had was amazing and I was told all the rooms had a similar view.The soundproofing is odd. We could hear nothing from the hallway, but when we stepped in bathroom we could hear every word from a room above. This could have been a fluke for our particular room - it is unclear. But the sound was magnified as if broadcast into our bathroom.The only issue we had with the hotel was check-in, where there are lines and only one person working (while you hear everyone else laughing in the back). Furthermore, forget about any Hilton Honors benefits. Your gruff and unfriendly check in person cannot be bothered to care. Want a room with two beds and you booked a King - no matter that the hotel is half empty, you must PAY UP and substantially (without having any extra people). Its crazy that hotels cannot figure out how much goodwill they can create by doing free upgrades when its so easy to do.

It serves a really nice and varied breakfast in the morning. It also serves food and drink in the evening. I thought the food was pretty awful and the drink is not complimentary so I wouldn't book the hotel for the lounge, if that is a sole deciding factor.I found the service at the hotel to be disappointing. It was not all bad - the man in the lounge was friendly, and we were checked out by a lovely guy at front desk. However we found many of the staff at the front desk to be quite unfriendly (I think sour and unsmiling would fit the bill). For example just after checkout my partner asked for a key to access the lobby restrooms and was wordlessly thrown a box of keys. We at one point asked for a spare shower gel and were told quite rudely that we should have 'dialled 6' but that they could sort it. No shower gel came. So all in all, an enjoyable stay.

I'll start with the one negative...I was not pleased with was the $50 charge to check in early. Whilst I appreciate the check in time is 4pm, if the room is ready, is there a need to charge? However, that aside, everything else was fantastic. We were greeted from our taxi by a very friendly gentleman, who took our cases into the lobby whilst we waited to check in. We were on the 39th floor and the views across the city were amazing! The room was perfect for what we needed. I requested an extra fridge and a kettle and they were delivered promptly. There is a coffee machine in the room but it wasn't to my liking, it is an espresso machine which I knew prior to our visit so I took my own coffee and bought some milk ( hence the request for a fridge) The bed was really comfy, just what we needed after a long day. The shower was great too! We had clean towels daily...the complimentary toiletries were a nice touch. There was a hair dryer and an iron in the room, and a safe which came in handy for locking away valuables.I cannot comment on the restaurant as we didn't use it during our visit. I would highly recommend Johns Cafe on the corner if you're looking for somewhere nearby to have a yummy breakfast at a reasonable price.The hotel is close to grand central station if you're looking to use the subway to get around, though it's within walking distance of Central Park and Times Square.I would definitely return to the millennium Hilton should I be lucky enough to visit this wonderful city for a second time.","Kent, United Kingdom","Skinnl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

I was also in a room on the 38th floor with incredible views. However, this stay was otherwise disappointing. Despite lots of staff standing around at the entrance to this hotel, no one greeted me or tried to help me out of the cab when I arrived. Throughout my stay, this did not change. There appeared to be lots of employees hanging around, but none of them ever addressed me in any way or offered me any help of any kind. At checkout, it took them forever to print out a copy of my bill. There were very apologetic, and I kept offering to have them email it to me, but they kept saying that the printer would be fixed any minute. Sigh.In the room, the desk area was mainly taken up by the TV, and there was no real room to do any work, which was an issue as I was on a work trip. There is an Illy coffee machine in the room, but I noticed that one of the coffee cups at the station was still dirty and there were coffee stains on the counter, so I went to Starbucks instead. The room's style was also not to my liking - it was trying to be very modern, but in a manner that was just inconvenient. For example, there was no shower door – just an opening at the end of the glass, which was weird. There was terrible lighting throughout the room, and I couldn't figure out how to turn on some of the lamps. One lamp was completely unplugged. I will definitely not be staying here again - there are just too many great hotels in NY to spend money on this one.","Fairfax, Virginia","khp_infairfax</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, Virginia</strong>",60,3.0

The bath is a joke though unless you're sub 5ft tall. I did not eat in the restaurant or bar so can't comment. Location wise it is great for the UN obviously and is a 10 minute walk from Grand Central where everything is reachable through the subway.

However, the service has deteriorated incredible since the Hilton assumed the management of itI stayed there 3 times since August (when the Hilton started managing it). This time I had the worst experience.I stayed for two nights. The second night at 1 am, my phone at the room was ringing and ringing. At some point I was so confused since I was completely slept. It was the reception who wanted to know if I am staying that night and if I can pay. I told them that it was not the right time to call. They said that they were trying to locate me the whole day. I responded that when I stayed at that hotel is because I had all day meetings at the UN.The next morning at 8:00, I went to speak to the manager to complain about the call.She said it is standard practice since we do not have a credit card for you. I told her that I have been a guess of that hotel for several years. She looked at it and said not I can not see you. Of course, I said I have never registered as a Hilton Honors. This is the first time since the hotel wanted to charge $ 14 dollars per night for internet connection if you are not a Hilton Honors client. I mentioned that to her and she said: ""I was in Punta Cana and they charge me that"". She does not have a sense of the tourism service sector. Hotels for business around the world offer free internet to attract clients. Punta Cana is a holiday destination.She was rude and she wanted me to pay since there was not credit card to guarantee my stay. I told her that I went to complain about the phone call by the reception desk at 1:00 am. And I was going to check out in 10 minutes since I was leaving to my meetings. I went to my room and went down again to checked out immediately and the bill was $255. I felt completely discriminated, treated as a criminal and offended since we have held several events in that hotel (now under Hilton) before. I am an old client of that hotel. There was no apologies for the call at 1:00 am. Only, I will talk to the person.This situation has never happened before. Hilton takes advantage charging your credit card for the whole amount prior to your stay plus $100 for anything else. The service is really bad: last time the room had dust in the tables,They do not change towels or put any toiletriesThe service at the restaurant is nice, And they were very accommodative to my food allergies. They were very careful and prepared my food to avoid any reactions.The concierges (the ones who take care of your luggage) are incredible as usual. These concierges have worked there for a long time. They even recognized me since I stay there so frequently. They are always very courteous, nice and provide the best client service.The staff at the reception needs training in client service and learn that not all the clients are criminals, They have to learn that clients will pay for the hotel room when they see that there is a corporate account who made the reservation. It was my worst experience in this hotel. I did not recommend it unless you have to be close to the UN for a meeting,","Washington DC, District of Columbia","BusinessSep</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",11,2.0

The room was also nice and spacious and clean (bar the coffee cups - see below). Location wise, it's within walking distance to Grand Central Station which gets you to most places, but also out of the way enough to be a fairly quiet part of town and not too busy. We really liked the location. For breakfast, there are plenty of little shops nearby to pick up coffee/breads, or there's a coffee shop in the lobby (which wasn't too expensive compared to outside and good for the first morning!). You also get coffee pods and a machine in your room, but these got a bit frustrating as they weren't replaced every day, nor were the coffee cups. We had to complain a couple of times about this before it became a daily replacement. Apparently these are serviced separately to the housekeeping for cleaning the room - we had no complaints about the housekeeping in terms of cleaning the rest of the room.Our biggest frustration with the hotel was the fire alarm ""test"" at 7.45am on a weekday. We got the impression that the fire alarm had malfunctioned as it blipped once and then they were testing it after to see if it worked. But then the ""test"" and apology for the initial blip which came through the speakers was excruciatingly loud and continued for about 15 minutes after this (following an equally loud annoucement), then repeated again about half an hour later. I understand the need for fire alarm tests but this particular one seemed ridiculous given the time it was carried out and the duration!Other minor niggles - the Wifi wasn't great (but can be expected in a big city with lots of tall buildings) and the air con was quite loud.

I booked the dream holiday vacation for my family in NYC and exhausted my points balance to stay at your hotel. Upon arrival one of my two rooms was not ready. When we entered the one room that was, I found feces inside the toilet, trash in the basket in the bedroom and remnants of hair as well as stains on the pillow case. I immediately asked for the room to be re-done. After exploring the city for several hours, we returned to find our second room ready. In this room I found towels with both black marks as well as a yellow stain on them. I brought them down to the manager Stanley and he apologized. Based on my Hilton status we had access to the executive lounge where I went up to get water and was able to enter. About an hour later I still had not received replacement towels. I personally went and spoke with Stanley again. Towels were delivered several hours later. The next evening we went to the executive lounge to sit as a family and plan our evening in the city and our key did not work but the gentleman working it let us in. He called the front desk to verify and was told we did not have access. He approached us in front of others and said we had to leave as we did not have access. I was livid and was on my way down to speak to whoever gave this incorrect information and actually ended up in the elevator with a manager named Nancy and explained my experience. She apologized and I later received a note from her with a credit for 10,000 points (which is really nothing as my stay was 900,000 between the 2 rooms) along with old fruit that came from the executive lounge. We were also given incorrect information regarding where the Honors breakfast was to be had. The waiter in the restaurant the next morning barely spoke English. I explained we had breakfast vouchers through Hilton Honors but he clearly did not understand. I had to bring this to the attention of the clerk who checked us in the day before who happened to be working the front desk and she admitted to giving us the wrong information. At that time a manager named Monique corrected the situation and supposedly also verified that we had executive level access which is where we were supposed to eat breakfast. I have never experienced more disconnect among management and customer service representatives. The amount of mistakes, inconvenien",,K7669YSmariam,3,1.0

All in all the Hilton One UN Plaza is an upper mid range to good hotel in my view and is a good choice for a stay in NYC. Real positives of the place is undoubtedly the views. What could you not like about waking up and looking out of your window at the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. House keeping in terms of cleaning was very good although it doesn’t seem to be standard practice to provide replenishments each day of toiletries or the other nice Hilton standard we have found in Asia Pacific of the Hilton robes and slippers. Staff in the Skyline Lounge were excellent and are an asset to Their employer. The Lounge itself is a strange one to rate. Breakfast is good whilst the happy hour options were terribly repetitive. Over our extended stay at Christmas and New Year their were chicken wings EVERY night. I think some more variety could be accommodated without too much trouble. The decor in the lounge is reminiscent of an old male smoking lounge and really does need an update from its 1984 look. The room we had was lovely modern and large. Something which I understand is not the norm in NYC. Check-in and reception generally were good. Efficient but perhaps could be more engaging with guests. It seemed very much strictly business. Of all the Hilton’s we have stayed in we were quite happy with One UN and would be happy to stay again. The hotel we found was in a good location and we quite often walked to 5th Ave, Times Square etc which is about a 25minute walk.

The reason is because my home office is located just a couple of blocks awayMy wife and I tried the hotel the first time in September. It was our anniversary and we were spending the weekend in the cityI booked this hotel and called when I saw online the had me next to the elevators. The person I spoke with at the front desk was OUTSTANDING. She put me into a corner room that had the UN/bridge view along with a view downtown. The room was very large and we were both impressed. Raved about it until 1:00 in the morning and the fire alarm went off. It was a false alarm which we were informed of within 5 minutes but the alarms didn't go off for a least 1/2 hour. Being startled out of bed by a fire alarm and then having the loud piercing noise go on for 1/2 hour and not being able to get back to sleep destroyed all the great things we were saying about the hotel. When we checked out there was not even an apology. Was very disappointed. We decided to stay again this past weekCheckin was just OK. Front desk was quiet. We arrived earlier than check in time. Was just looking to check my bag and would have waited for a room. Front desk person did not verbally acknowledge my Diamond membership. I asked if there was any upgrades available. She said she did upgrade me. We got to the room and while a corner room, it was a handicap room. The view was uptown (not much to see) a blocked view of the UN and bridges. The handicap room has a very large bathroom and a large open shower that allows water to overflow onto the bathroom floor. No doors separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom. Water is lukewarm and because it's only large bathroom, you get the chill from the room. It will not get a warm bathroom because of the lack of very hot water and the size of the bathroom. So much for a nice hot shower. Not a great way to start your day in the morning. Hotel is beautiful and very large rooms, but have missed out twice with me.

Not that late in the city that purports to never sleep...It somewhat put a dampener on the evening, especially as there aren’t very many other places to visit in this part of town.

Forget a quiet lie-in: we were surrounded by the constant loud slamming of doors around us and along the hall, either by guests leaving or by housekeeping staff going in and out of neighbouring rooms. Most entertaining was the minibar checker who, every morning around 9:00am, went down the hall using his key to knock on doors, announcing his visit, slamming the door going in and slamming the door going out. Clickety-click, ""room service"", slam, slam. Then on to every single room on the floor.We didn't use other hotel facilities as the whole place was on slow holiday mode.

However, I'd say that this place has definitely been below standard in most aspects. I'll start off with the good points:- Easy to find- Well positioned for Grand Central Terminal and midtown- Lobby is stunning- Bellhops were very pleasant- Small coffee and light bites shopA few other bits, like the view was alright, but not every room can have a stunning view over mid/downtown.When we arrived, we'd been travelling for near enough 12 hours. We went to check in and instantly felt unwelcome. It seemed as though the lady behind the desk just wanted rid of us. There was no ""Welcome to"" or anything. She just looked at us until we spoke to her. We checked in with no idea where anything was and had to ask one of the bellhops where we needed to go. We had no idea where the restaurant, bar, or any other facilities were.There's nothing more welcoming than a stony glare.We got up to the room and went to make a coffee, but found that the machine hadn't been cleaned or emptied. On top of that, there are only 2 regular coffee pods and 2 sugar packets in the room.After our room had been cleaned one day, one of our toothbrushes was absolutely disgusting. I have no proof, so will not make any allegations, but a toothbrush that has been out of the packet for 4 days does not end up looking like that by itself. Take from that what you will. For 2 days on the trot there were fire alarm tests that started an hour before they were due to. We were only notified of this by letter the day before the second set of tests. Whilst I understand the importance of these tests it's not really acceptable to say that they'll be at a certain time and then start them an hour earlier. Again we went to the desk to enquire about leaving our bags for a few hours after we check out, but before we leave. We were met with the same stony coldness as before, but from a different attendant this time. As I said, we've previously stayed at Hilton hotels elsewhere, and had nicer experiences mainly in terms of staffing. I personally wouldn't stay here again, unless the deal was unmissable.

The hotel itself is beyond cement barriers and police dogs check guests’ baggages. We felt safe in the neighborhood and it wasn’t a problem. The room size was good, especially taking into account the NYC average size, I loved the awesome view of the Chrysler literally from bed, our Chinese housekeeper (sorry I can’t remember her name) was very friendly and the room was clean. I also must thank the front office manager for giving me instructions to get a package delivered before arrival. Yet for the future I don’t know if I would go back for a couple reasons: the elevators were too slow and could not serve all the guests causing long waits especially at peak hours, the facilities weren’t clearly displayed (gym floor, lounge hours) and on the last morning we had to clean a table ourselves to have breakfast, the hotel doesn’t have a spa area and during the freezing days there it would have been useful, but above all some people of the staff have a bad attitude towards customers who are just visitors. To me this is unacceptable, my money is not less worth because I’m a tourist instead of a UN member, ex. I approached the reception two days before checkout to ask for a late check-out and the lady (Dianne) quickly got rid of me saying I should ask on the day of check out, she then started a call on the phone even though I was still standing there because I had to ask something else. Useless to say the I found her at check out on the morning of check out and without knowing the room number or whatever info she quickly got rid of me saying it was not possible to have a late check out because it is on an availability basis. When I made her notice the room number and that I was a gold member, again quickly, she said I could arrive at 12 instead of 11 but over I would have to pay an extra, so this was a confirmation that the hotel was not full but she simply would not take into consideration my request.

The complimentary soaps, shampoo and conditioner smelled amazing as well. I know that is an odd thing to note, but it is true. The only downfall to this stay was the location of the hotel. It was a good distance away from some of the more popular main attractions. But that was on us, not the hotel. We booked the hotel based on price and not knowing what we wanted to exactly do in the city. We ended up taking a taxi to different parts of the city which was not a problem at all.

Also saw an armed officer with his K-9 in what appeared to be a routine perimeter check outside the lobby along the sidewalk. Nothing unexpected considering proximity to UN. Pleasantly upgraded to a suite up on the 37th floor with a view of the East River. Very spacious. Separate room with bed and bathroom/shower from main suite. Suite has separate washroom, wet bar, TV, round dining table, seating area and large work desk. Had a fridge in the suite with the wet bar, not sure if the fridge comes in the standard room. Room décor was modern, dressed in light colors. The lights were all automatic operable from several wall switches and a wall mounted touch pad near the desk. Heard some room noise from the floor above but otherwise a quiet stay. Decent black-out curtains worked well. As a HH member, standard WiFi is free. Not sure if you have to pay if not a HH member.Executive Lounge on the 30th floor had the typical Hilton breakfast spread in the morning, room was a little small but is wraps around to the south of the building creating separate spaces which was nice if you like to seclude yourself. I was in and out and didn't have time to explore other amenities or check out the bar or restaurant. Couldn't be closer to the UN plaza. An easy walk (about 15 minutes) over to my business meetings due west on Ave of the Americas/ Bryant Park. Wanted to try a steak and a cocktail around the corner at The Palm Too but will have to wait until next time.If you are traveling in/out of JFK or LGA airports, it helps that the hotel is on the east side and near the Queens Midtown tunnel therefore virtually eliminating the hassle of crosstown traffic and that nightmare.","Los Angeles, California","xtytan94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,5.0

The hotel was SUPPOSED to have an indoor pool, that was the entire reason we picked this location. Otherwise we would have stayed in Times Square. Priceline is advertising there is an indoor pool with windows all around to give a view of the city, but the concierge advised the pool had been closed for THREE YEARS for renovations. The hotel was a little out of the way of locations we were visiting, but we chose it solely for the pool, so we were very disappointed. It was my nephew's first time in NYC, we were celebrating his 13th birthday; I really wanted to make it fun for him. The concierge did comp us breakfast for this inconvenience, however, I am really glad we did not pay $30 apiece for that breakfast as is normally charged. The food was cold, flavorless (like hospital food), and no food was present to warrant charging that much per person, especially a child. We also had numerous issues with the elevators going up to the 37th floor. We got stuck and had to call for help TWICE, and the elevators dropped us off on the wrong floor twice. Each time we got on the elevator, it was mild anxiety, but it wasn't really possible with me being 6 months pregnant to walk up 37 floors to our room. The room was nice, for the price I would have expected some nicer toiletries. I've stayed in a beautiful Best Western (believe it or not) in Cortez Colorado that was a quarter of the price, but the amenities were top notch. I understand it is New York City, but it is also a Hilton, it would not hurt to put a little more time and attention into the details. The bellmen were very gracious and helpful, as were the restaurant wait staff and two out of three concierges we interacted with.

At that time, the ""pool in the sky"" on the 27th floor was a major draw with spectacular views. Unfortunately, it has been closed for a while now. In those days, the Ambassador Grill offered one of the best Sunday brunches in Manhattan, offering champagne and fresh oysters. Now to the present. I love the location. It's quiet, safe and there are many dining options on 2nd or 3rd Avenues that will satisfy any budget. I can walk to Grand Central Station in under 15 minutes, Times Square in 20 minutes, Central Park in 25 minutes and Union Square in 45 minutes. The rooms are commodious, especially by New York standards. I like the design and use of space that they offer. Of course, the views are spectacular. In the west wing, where I usually stay, odd numbered rooms face the city and even numbered rooms face the East River. I really don't think there's a bad room in the hotel, in terms of the view, as it starts on the 28th floor and goes up to the 40th. No looking into adjacent buildings or inner courtyards, as is so often the case with properties downtown. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows afford an elevated sense of space.Now that the property is managed by Hilton, elite members can look forward to the usual benefits, such as late check-out, lounge access and/or breakfast, among others. The Skylounge on the 30th floor, offers a limited, but good quality continental breakfast, and a nice selection of hot and cold hors d'oeuvres, snacks and beverages in the evening. Wine and beer is available at a reasonable cost of $5. The views to the Chrysler Building are especially lovely during breakfast, when the sun bathes the spire in gold. I've been visiting New York for 45 years on my own, and up until April, 36 with my late wife. This hotel has always offered a reliable product, in terms of service and accommodation, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting NYC, be it for business or pleasure. Of the 30 hotels in Manhattan we visited, this was, and still is, amongst our favourites.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","flyme2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",38,5.0

The hotel has amazing views, walking distance to subway, Grand Central Terminal, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, etc.The reason for my stay at this hotel was for a wedding. I had the pleasure of working with Esther Song, Assistant Director of Sales to coordinate a wedding in a short period of time. Three weeks to be exact. To say she was incredible would be an understatement, she addressed all our concerns, recommended and coordinated, flowers, cake, etc. On the day of the event, I also had the pleasure of working with Matthew Flood, Director of Banquets and his team who oversaw all the food service for the evening. Both Esther and Matthew were present during the entire event to ensure that all went according to plan. When they were given a last-minute request, they handled it like true professionals and accommodated the family. The wedding was held in the Landmark Room which was spectacular with a skyline view of various New York City Landmarks. Should you ever be looking for a venue for an event whether large or small you should definitely consider the Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza Hotel.

( You don’t always get the hotel room in the pictures so was a bit skeptic). When we arrived everything looked very fancy and we had a doorman open the door for us and took our luggage of us until we had checked in at reception.The only bad part about the hotel: (nothing too major as still gave the hotel 5*) - when we went to reception we were asked to pay all up front including a $200 deposit, we wasn’t given a receipt until we checked out. We arrived around 11:30/12:00 however reception was advising we couldn’t have the room until 16:00. I was told when I booked I could check in at 15:00, but reception wasn’t budging and we was very jet lagged so couldn’t be bothered to argue. Reception staff were quite rude and not very polite however the Bell men and concierge men were very helpful and lovely and we tipped them quite often. You can get taxis from outside the hotel also, just ask and they will stop a yellow cab for you. However, this isn’t needed much as you are close to everything, you can easily get to Times Square, central station, madison square garden and Central Park and all other places in the area. We went out roaming until 16:00 when we could finally check in. We was put on the 34th floor in a corner room. The elevator took us up there which took 45 seconds most.The room was the most amazing thing I have ever stayed in. This is due to the view we had of the whole city.. Being a corner room we have one view of the river and one of the city, both day and night this is a view I will never forget and definitely didn’t want to leave. The windows were squeaky clean so could see everything and the room in general was extremely clean. The bed was queen size and big enough for 3 people, memory foams pillows also. Bathroom had bath and shower, all toiletries were there and plenty of towels. Maids came in everyday and made our bed so the room was always clean. They have a small variety of tea and coffee available and a small fridge (not stocked with anything) TV in the room is humongous and you can sign in to Netflix etc. WiFi not great any where in the hotel so struggled to use internet, some days was brilliant but over the whole trip more days off than on. They also have a small cafe / Tour desk open in the hotel which is handy.Very good for the value we paid especially being in New York City. All in all this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and would highly recommend to anyone thinking of spending that little bit extra on their hotel as it did make our trip!If I return to NYC I will definitely be staying here.

This is not the typical annoying NYC sardine can hotel.- Location means generally a higher class of guest (business + political travellers, less worry that you will have noisy neighbours keeping you up at night).- Quiet rooms (based on my 2 stays thus far.). Seems like good sound-proofing between rooms.- Restaurant / room service quality is great. Pricey, but not relative to other offerings in similar class of hotel. It's what one would expect.- Internet: higher speed than the typical offering these days in Hilton NYC properties. Not always perfect, but decent enough for serious work / VPN etc. Sometimes the upload quality was slower than ideal (difficult for modern day working with automatic uploading, Dropbox, etc...).- For Hilton Diamond members: executive lounge is wonderful. There is usually one hot offering in the morning (eggs or some such), but if you're like me and need a proper bit of protein after a morning workout, you'll need to go to the buffet / restaurant on in the lobby and pay the full price, which can be quite pricey if you want a proper balanced breakfast to fuel your NY work day madness. A suggestion to the hotel would be to provide some more options other than ""Free with very limited choice in the executive lounge"" or what ends up being ""$50 for going hog-wild at a huge buffet"". Typical business travellers need something in between, such as a few more protein choices in the executive lounge, or a $10 charge or some such for access to the main breakfast area. Notwithstanding the above, the staff themselves are however very understanding and accommodating.- Transportation: not the most convenient options for subways, but you can still get where you need to go if you're willing to do a bit of walking first.SERVICE- Apart from being a top-class property where you will not find fault with any of the rooms or have any lack of comfort, the service by the staff certainly sets this property a cut above.- They staff go absolutely above and beyond to make you feel welcome, appreciated, and important. They will bend over backwards to help you, and are clearly hospitality professionals. This makes a very noticeable and positive difference to business travellers who are weary of being on the road all the time. The extra care and attentiveness is very welcome.- Particular mentions: Erika and Avery (simply because I have not interacted with many others yet) - they are absolutely WONDERFUL and are for sure a big part of why this is now one of two Hilton properties that will be my default choices when in NYC.

A beautiful view of the Chrysler building and the Empire State Building. Delicious coffee (free of charge) from the coffee maker in the room. Wifi is free and fast, which is essential. The safe was quite large. Now, if I have to think of something that wasn't perfect: I did not manage to make the large overhead shower work, so I relied on the hand shower. Unfortunately no bathtub, but the shower cabin is very nice. I don't think there was a bath robe, which would be a nice addition. Maybe they would have brought one if I had asked. There were times when getting an elevator was painstakingly slow - I think I waited close to three minutes on one occasion, which is not great when you are in a hurry to go to a meeting. Front desk staff are very friendly, but you may have to wait a bit to get someone's attention during busy periods of the day.

Check in and out were efficient and friendly. Rooms start on about the 30th floor and with no close taller buildings (apart from the hotel's other tower) you are assured of a good view. We chose a corner room which had stunning views down the East River towards lower Manhattan, as well as across to the Empire State. The hotel has had a great refurb since I was last there. The room was an excellent size with a huge (larger than king size) bed, long desk/dressing table, desk chair, easy chair and sofa. Plenty of hanging space and shelving for clothes. Bathroom was a very good size with a powerful shower over a low rise bath (which could get a bit slippy and could benefit from a hand rail.) The room had a safe, a coffee machine, and a fridge (not a stocked mini-bar - but handy for keeping water and juice). The hotel's location is good - about 10 minutes walk from Grand Central Station which is useful for the subway, but also walkable to the Empire State building, Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue and Times Square. There were 2 issues that prevented me giving this hotel an ""excellent"" rating: 1) We decided to eat in the hotel on the Sunday. I phoned the Ambassador Grill and was told we didn't need a reservation. When we arrived the restaurant was closed (that hadn't been mentioned on the phone) but food was being served in the Bar. That was fine, there was a table available - but the service was appalling. There was one poor member of staff who was rushed off his feet being both barman and waiter. We waited over an hour for just two main courses. Something had clearly gone wrong in the kitchen as we were asked after about 30 minutes what our order had been and then had to remind them a second time before the food arrived. We received a brief apology but no offer of any reduction in the bill or a complementary drink (that did happen after we complained but we shouldn't have had to). 2) On our last day we were woken by housekeeping at 08.30 a.m. trying to enter our room and asking what time we were checking out. Luckily we had the security lock on. We had forgotten to put the Do Not Disturb sign on but even so, we thought that was aggressive and unnecessary as they knew we would have to have checked out by 11.

In addition, there were no hidden fees, unlike our last experience on Price Line - Name your own price. In that case, my bid was accepted by WestHouse in NYC and only after it was accepted did I learn that there were mandatory fees. So much for Name Your Own Price!A couple of minor gripes: The bath tub was slippery - it did not have a no skid surface nor a rubber mat.

When I measured the bed, it was about 110cm wide!! For two people! Sadly, this was not mentioned to me when making the booking, so I just assumed a ‘deluxe double double’ would be quite a nice room for the three of us!Eventually, I had to ask for two more duvets so I could sleep on the floor - no other offer was made.And then the additional kick in the teeth was to be told by Hilton Honours that my booking didn’t count for their rewards program!

From the moment we checked in, he was condescending on the simplest questions. He repeatedly told us the guaranteed check in time was 3pm so could not be any earlier. We came back on time for him to tell us the hotel changed the check in time to 4pm and he didn’t know. It’s fine if someone makes a mistake. But how do you give a long explanation of how he was away on holiday last week and he didn’t know the check in time had been changed WITHOUT ONCE APOLOGIZING for his mistake. So blatant is his rudeness that you have to applaud his skills for not taking any ownership over a clear oversight in his part. When we asked him for the bathroom key, he once again gave us the wrong key so we had to by this time stand in line already 3 times at the front desk. And let me tell you, that line is not short or fast given who’s operating it. (BTW, what sort of hotel needs a key from the staff to use the lobby bathroom! This is not a dingy, back-alley restaurant!) But this is just a simple problem with one person, Avery. The bigger problem with this hotel is that it’s not a hotel. Nobody has been trained in customer service to help you with issues you may encounter while travelling. Misinformation among staff is rampant. (Ex. We called front desk to make sure the food delivery person could come up to the room to deliver, we were assured that wouldn’t be a problem by a female staff, just to find out that they weren’t allowed in when they arrived and we had to change out of our pajamas to go downstairs to get the food) The bellhop who keeps luggage by the door is efficient but will make you carry your bags in and out of the closet and pull them down the shelf yourself. We saw the other guest in front of us holding a couple of dollars to tip and after being asked to do the work himself he put the tip back in his pocket. We did the same. Seriously, we don’t ask to be spoiled or for a 5-star service. We know what we payed for. But just common, human decency now and then would be nice. Don’t put condescending jerks like Avery at the front desk to be the first person we meet at your “”hotel”” (double quote marks for this as you don’t deserve to be called a hotel)",,katty890,43,1.0

The area is less densely populated and it was lovely to feel some open space. Transport worked well for us too, it being 10 mins or so from Grand Central and we also used the ferries a couple of times, to make a pleasant change and for the lovely views. The ferries were a 15 minute walk.We got the sky train from JFK and the metro and then a taxi for the final leg - all perfectly doable in the early afternoon. On return, we got a taxi which was slightly cheaper than the airport bus for the 3 of us.There were no shortage of eateries in the vicinity and we ate at Patsys, Le Pain Quotodien and Pershing Square diner. Le Pain Quotodien was a particular favourite.The hotel staff were all exceptionally pleasant. We did need to change rooms however. We had booked a double, double room as we were accompanied by our 12 year old. However, the room was not as described, and as my husband had an existing shoulder injury, he had to sleep with my 12 year old to stand any chance of getting any sleep. The beds looked scarcely larger (if at all) than singles. The staff did move us the next night without any fuss, however, that room contained beds only marginally larger (not doubles) and the room was not as nice in other respects; there was no bath as the bathroom was less than half the size and the view, whilst great, was not as amazing. The rooms really should not be advertised as suitable for sleeping 3, unless they are small children; my husband still had to sleep with our son and we were relieved to get home to our double bed! To add insult to injury, we had to attend A&E on our return as his shoulder had got much worse and he is now on even more heavy duty painkillers! The aircon was good, but noisy, in both the rooms that we had.The rooms had good coffee machines, although we had to ask daily for refills and we also had to ask for supplies of shampoo/conditioner etc in our second room - I have to say though, that when asked, the hotel staff appear like lightening! It would be good if the hotel were able to supply a 'courtesy room' so we could have freshened up prior to our late night flight back to the UK.The hotel was much nicer than our stay in a midtown 4 star previously and I would have rated this 5 stars if the room description had been accurate.",London,"Womble769</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",21,4.0

We dropped off our luggage and decided to go to lunch.We checked in again later in the day and our keys were ready and waiting for us. We were in room 3343 a one bedroom suite. The room was bright, large and clean. The room was almost perfect except for a few large tears in the carpet in the living area. At this point we decided to cool down and relax in our room for a little while. Around 6 we went to the 30th floor to the Sky Lounge for the cocktail hours. The snacks weren't to our liking (and not dairy free) so we opted to spend $10 on two glasses of red wine.

Didn't arrive back until 7:30pm and were quickly given our room keys. Rooms are spacious and unique (to me) as when you walk in the door there was a hallway to the right that led to bathroom and to the left was the bedroom. Kind of nice as you have some privacy if in bathroom. King bed, very soft, as were the pillows. Not my preference but my wife had no problems. Flat screen HDTV that worked well. Bathroom was spacious but could have used a light in the shower as the toilet was separated from rest of room and had a half wall separating it from the vanity. There was light over toilet and one over vanity but not in shower. Customary toilietries, hair dryer were offered as well as a magnifying/lighted mirror attached to wall. Shower had both a fixed shower head and another flexible one which was nice. Water pressure was OK, nice and hot. Room had a good size closet that had a complimentary safe in it. Dry cleaning was offered with the bags/tickets in the closet. There was a iron/ironing board also in closet. There was a mini fridge/empty for your use that kept stuff good and cold. also a coffee maker that my wife tried that was not good. Big picture window overlooking the UN and the river. there were plenty of lighting options but bulbs were all dim. so if like me you are farsighted makes it tough for reading without holding it right up to light. was a nice flexible arm reading light on each side of bed. ihome clock radio that you could dock your iphone on to charge/play music. however not enough outlets in this technology age around the bed. 2 outlets on my side both take by a lamp and said ihome clock radio. Desk on opposite side of bed had couple outlets and usb ports for your electronics. room was very clean and made service was good. Check out was 12 noon which was nice/later than accustomed. There was a coffee/breakfast/convenience store in lobby. Coffee was pretty good also pretty pricey. 2 blocks away on 3rd ave there was a D&D. Lobby also had the Ambassador restaurant which we did not go in. Would definitely stay here again if price was right. is a bit of a walk to time square, grand central. and being this far from times square less dining options that hotels closer to the action. real easy exit (by car) to FDR and out of the city heading north to Boston.","Bridgewater, Massachusetts","bri11164</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgewater, Massachusetts</strong>",308,4.0

The view was fantastic, as expected from what I'd seen in the photos when booking. We were surprised though that there was no drinks in the mini-bar and it wasn't stocked during our stay (though we didn't request for it to be). The windows in the room and especially the Skyline bar really do need a clean! I found a number of hairs in the bathroom and around the toilet when we first got to our room, and throughout our stay it was obvious that the cleaner didn't bother at all to hoover the bathroom up. One major annoyance was the soundproofing, or lack of in the rooms. There was a door into the room next door which must be paper-thin, we could literally hear every word the guests next door were saying to each other, which then made myself and my partner very aware of our conversations and thus had to whisper to each other. On one occasion they were playing music at 5am, which was probably not of a very loud volume if the walls were solid, but because of the door into next door it woke us up straight away. The breakfast was rather basic, the only hot food on offer was scrambled eggs, but were of a good quality. There were plenty of pastries which were very tasty too. The other options were selection boxes of cereals, toast, and some fruit. It was always pretty quiet at breakfast and again the views were great with it being on the corner of the building.

The rooms are large and I had a little walk-in closet and you can store your luggage, so you don't have to see it. The bathroom is fairly large and the room overall is huge although awkwardly designed. There was a large sofa against the wall with a round table and a large chair but no place to work. The TV in the room is HUGE, must have been 46 inches and it is a smart TV, so you can log into your Netflix account but remember to log out before you leave. The hotel is a little dingy and could use an update. The windows were filthy and I could not see outside very well. This seem to be a problem around the whole hotel as the executive lounge also had filthy windows. This is really too bad, since the hotel offers some excellent views of Manhattan.I think overall the place was decent but could use an update and cleaning. Now for the executive lounge; as a gold member you are given access to their happy hour and continental breakfast. What a mess that place is! Of the 4 days I was there, I visited once and left immediately. No utensils, no cups, half the food had already been consumed and under staffed. Almost all the tables had dirty dishes, so many of us were standing around trying to find a place to sit. There was some fruit and bread to toast and that's it. It was quite depressing and really too bad not a full breakfast is offered. I did visit the restaurant on the ground floor for breakfast one day but expect a 42$ bill pp. Outrageous! As for the area, there is practically nowhere to eat. The choices are limited and because you are from everything you have to walk several blocks to catch a subway, nearest place is grand central. Now it is not at negative, I prefer to stay in more central areas and this place didn't work for me. I walked to my office 1.5 miles a day each way. The area is safe and mostly residential. You'll just have to walk a little to get to the action.

The receptionists were reasonable not the fastest and were a bit confused about this whole Hilton Honor scheme which you need to get the free wifi, in the end we spent about 20 minutes wasting our time so that I could give them the Honors code.The lifts are a bit annoying as you need your keycard to go up to any of the floors from the lobby, which is ok I guess as it means the homeless population of New York cannot access your floor and try to rob you.We chose the Deluxe King size room, this came with a big king size bed, fridge and coffee maker machine. However, the coffee maker machine made horrible coffee I nearly threw up drinking it.There is a good size bathroom with a shower with two heads. Overall I was pleased with the room as it came with a reasonable size TV allowing me to watch some good shows when we stayed in. The room service was excellent, cleaning the room to a good standard. However, they woke us up in the morning if you did not put the sign on the door. Saying that, even when we did have the sign on the door they still knocked on the door asking if we would like coffee.The hotel location is ok, it is about 25 minuets walk from times square and 10 minutes walk from Grand Central Station. What let this room down was the fact that my wireless Bluetooth 60$ headphones were stolen by the cleaning staff. I was very upset, I left the headphones on the table and I could not find them. I believe they were stolen as they looked quite expensive. As a result, I will never ever stay in this hotel again as they made me feel vulnerable with leaving my belongings in the hotel. I am not sure why the cleaning staff would feel that is it ok to steal from the guests when they are effectively paying their wages.I would like Hilton management in this hotel to make the cleaning staff aware that stealing is a crime in the USA and is not acceptable in such a upmarket hotel.Also note that you will face heightened security entering this hotel if there is an event going on at the UN. Luckily, we left the day the UN General Assembly was going to take place. I however, feel for the UN people as their possessions are not safe and would not advise anyone to take expensive belongings to this hotel unless you store them in the safe or chain them somewhere somehow. The pool was out of action when we went to this hotel so I cannot comment on this.","Feltham, United Kingdom","Jason M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Feltham, United Kingdom</strong>",43,3.0

They are just plain rude but thankfully the lovely guys on the Concierge are just happy and helpful!

A customer shouldn't have to call down to reception to ask for toilet rolls in their room , it should be part of the daily cleaning routine . Then again none of the toiletries in the bathroom were replaced for 5 nights Please get the basics right you will then have happy customers!

And, of course, coffee pods were not restocked. It became a daily routine of requesting service, not once was it serviced properly...it became a running joke.

We stayed here with another couple in August 2017 and chose this hotel due to a great deal we found online. We encountered several unacceptable issues during our stay:1. When we first checked into our room, the toilet wasn't working properly and the sink was clogged with dark floating particles inside. We called the front desk and asked to switch rooms and they quickly switched us to a different room.2. Right before we were about to check out from our room, the cleaning staff knocked on our door only once, and proceeded to walk in on me while I was in the midst of changing, causing an incredibly embarrassing and uncomfortable situation for me. The cleaning attendant should have waited for a response to check if anyone was inside the room. Completely unacceptable! 3. At check out, we let the front desk know about the embarrassing encounter with the cleaning attendant, and they told us they would compensate us for the preventable mishap. The next day we noticed my credit card, which was provided at check-in, was not charged, and the hotel double charged my friend's card instead. Trying to correct this, we called the hotel and let them know about the billing error. - The hotel told us that they were going through a ""Name Change"" and could not resolve the issue for at least 3-4 business days, as their entire staff was in a super important meeting and very busy for the next little while. Being patient, we waited 4 days and, after no follow-up from the hotel as promised, we called back and they assured us they would credit my friend's card and charge mine instead. - What should have been a 5 minute process, did not end up happening for an ENTIRE MONTH! The manager said he would fix the billing error and follow-up with us, however he did not follow through on his promise. We had to play phone tag for an entire month to have our issue resolved and our concerns listened to! This is by FAR, the WORST hotel experience I have ever been through. Management at this hotel clearly DO NOT care about their customers and their concerns. We had countless e-mails and phone calls ignored by staff.

Instead I am going to take this opportunity and give you a more accurate depiction of my time at this hotel. Before the summer was over I decided to take nine days and stay at this beautiful hotel. It has been one year since my father passed away and it's a place where he always loved to come. The hotel offers great views of New York City skyscrapers, as well as the East River. The room was excellent and clean when I got there with the exception of an empty bottle of KY jelly under the bed that all in all did not ruin that beautiful room for me. The Big screen television was nice I used it to watch a few movies as well as do some work off of my laptop. The bathroom was carefully stock with towels, soap, bath gel and an excellent shower head with excellent pressure. One of the best part about staying here was I felt that in the beginning especially the first two days the people who work at the hotel were very courteous. This hotel is near the United Nations so of course security is priority at the entrance of the hotel there is a dog trained to sniff out any unwanted materials that may be in anyone's luggage or possession. Taxis lined up by the entrance of the hotel for anyone that needs to make a speedy trip anywhere around the city. Like in most other hotels every morning you get the option of having your room serviced or the option of more privacy. On the sixth day of the trip I had to make a few trips around New York very early in the morning and I had left my laptop computer, my DSLR camera, my iPad Pro, my towel and the iPad Pro pencil. Because all of these things were on the bed and I did not have a chance to lock it up in the safe that every room has what's the reason why I requested no service this day I did not want anyone to be going through my things. When I got back to the room that night I saw that the room had been serviced because the laptop was moved to the small table and my iPad and camera were also moved. I noticed that my iPad Pro pencil was missing something that I paid $100 for. I went to the front desk and they said that housekeeping and the manager was gone for the day and that I would have to get in contact with them in the morning. The following day I called housekeeping and told him what happened, they apologized and said that I'm sure it was not stolen but they are pretty sure that it was a mistake. They also asked what they could due to correct the situation. I told the housekeeping manager that I would be happy with the replacement of the product that was lost/stolen. She then said that she would be up to the room. She never came, instead this day but I stayed outside for hours waiting for someone to turn to me instead housekeeping came and said if I needed my room serviced? I told her not until I get to speak with a manager or security that I have been waiting for for more than three hours. And hour later security arrived started his preliminary investigation and eventually the manager would arrive and I told them exactly what happened and what the housekeeping about it we said about replacing the product and all they had to say was that they will continue their investigation and promised that they would call me back. It's been more than two weeks since I checked out of this hotel I was given four different numbers to call and not one of them has called me back I have a notebook full of names and numbers but yet no one has even bothered to respect any of the things that you said and promised. While I was checking out the hotel attendant all he said was this usually doesn't happen here. When I explain to him what happened he says don't worry someone will call you back. Like most people I like to go to good places I spend my money of places that have some kind of value and reputation many times you don't know the value of a place until you actually are faced with a situation where they have to show their character. I am not sure if they will fail you but they have definitely felt me and I will think twice before recommending this place to anyone before I recommend another place. I'm sorry I was not someone that Deserved to be treated as a guest and perhaps security measures will be improved for other guests I'm sorry for the long message, but this have really left a very disappointing feeling inside of me.",Nw York City,"neversaycant1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nw York City</strong>",27,1.0

The beds are not double beds however! I am not sure if beds are a different size in the US, but they were between a single and a double. I knew it would be tight with the 4 of us sharing a room but the beds were just too small. I rang down to reception and was offered an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite for an extra 150 dollars a night, or some duvets and pillows to make up a bed on the floor. I discussed it with the kids and we decided to make do, and whilst it wasn't a massive problem because we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, it did grieve me that I had travelled all that way and spent all that money for one of my kids to sleep on the floor. I had done my research very thoroughly before I went, but had never seen it mentioned anywhere that the beds were small.

That's the only positive feedback I can provide. I requested a room by others in my party and received a complementary upgrade to accommodate my request. While this was appreciated, the room was a disaster. There was a huge stain on the carpet and stains all over the curtains. They were also ripped at the top. There were nasty gouge marks in the shower, too. There was also a mild vibration in the room. It couldn't be felt from the bed, but could while standing up. (It was enough to shake the TV on the wall.) I'm assuming it was from the air conditioning from the room above or below me. I should have requested a new room, but didn't. I did mention all of this during checkout and received a wince and an apology. I hope other rooms in this hotel are not as awful as this one was. I, however, won't be staying here again. By the way, neither me nor others in my party could figure out how to make the regular shower work. We could only get water to come out of the hand-held shower head.

I stayed in what I think was a renovated King Corner Room. The views were fantastic and the new Japanese toilet with remote control a very interesting and hygienic experience. Amenities were great: free wifi, complimentary coffee/tea facilities (illy coffee), laptop safe, mini fridge and big flatscreen tv with sufficient channels. Room was very clean and the bed slept wonderful. Housekeeping came to ask if I had everything what I needed, which is a rare service in most other hotels I have stayed in all over the world. Breakfast buffet is good with plenty of choices although expensive. You better go to one of the diners or take out places around 2nd Avenue. There is plenty of choice starting right opposite of hotel. What is nice though, the hotel has an illy coffee bar with simple sandwiches, bagels and the like for take out if you are in a rush. The room prices vary depending on the season and events that take place at the time of booking. This time was over 300$ a night while I have paid a bit over 200$ for a same room on another occasion.

That said, I do have a question for the hotel-- do you have policies about how people sit in the lobby chairs while waiting for their room to be ready? I arrived early and, as a result, had to wait about ~3 hours for my room to be ready. That's fine-- I was early and the hotel seemed busy with other people in a similar situation. I found an open chair across from an older gentleman who was happy to share the table. I proceeded to work on my laptop and take a few brief work calls. As the hours rolled on, I became increasing uncomfortable in the chair and slowly slouched over to the side. Out of nowhere, a male hotel employee approached me in a very harsh tone and told me I needed to sit a different way. I did not have my feet on the furniture and nothing was showing-- I was SHOCKED by the comment and by the frank disdain in his voice. He spoke to me like he would to a child. The man across from me was even shocked and voiced that I wasn't doing anything wrong. I firmly believe that he wouldn't have made a comment like that if I were a man. I don't like be spoken to like a child-- I'm an adult, professional woman who was a paying guest at the hotel waiting for my room to be ready.

Concierge/other staff were very pleasantNegatives/Comedy of errors I'd requested a room with a bathtub, so when we arrived, we were told our room wasn't ready yet because of our ""special request"". We checked in two hours later and were given a room with a shower. We called down and they told us to come back to reception, with our luggage. We were then moved to a different room in a separate tower. We were told by the man escorting us to our room that this tower was better as it had the gym, spa and swimming pool on the roof.The new room had a bathtub, but no sheets on the bed(?) We were heading out for dinner, so just asked them to change the sheets on the way out. We also noticed that the wifi wasn't working.Getting back at 1am, they hadn't. So I tried to call down again to ask, but the phone didn't connect so I had to go down to ask and then waited about 45 minutes.I had a little bit of work to do the following day, but the internet still wasn't working. I asked at reception, and it appeared that the internet wasn't working anywhere but the foyer which was packed with guests and laptops.We decided to go for a swim, so went up to the pool. On walking in, I was hit in the head by a bare wire that was dangling from the ceiling. Having a quick look around, the pool was void of water but pretty full of debris. Clearly there was some construction work going on that was neither signed nor apparent to the staff. This 'spa area' was a claim waiting to happen.

All rooms have nice views of NYC (west) and Brooklyn (east). The strange thing is that the windows are relatively small for the views that this hotel has. Rooms are more spacious than we expected. In the same room category some of the rooms have walk in closets and a couch, while some have smaller windows and others top-down.We prefered west views through large windows sacrificing the extra space. Floor is not a great matter since all rooms are high enough. We had rooms on 34th and 40th floor and could not tell the difference.Their current condition is ok except from the old rooms doors and windows, that do not provide isolation. So you might have a problem with rooms near the elevators. Bathroom is nice and modern, with amenities. Wi-fi effective as anything in the room. Mattress is acceptable but could be better. Illy coffee machine and a fridge for own use was more than welcomed.

Wifi worked fine for me except for the last day when I had poor connection for some reason.In terms of location, unlike some other reviewers we didn't think it was too far out from the tourist attractions at all. Grand central is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel and from there you can get a really short shuttle to times square or get a subway anywhere. If you want to walk to Times Square it takes about 20-25 mins.For breakfast, definitely visit Cafe Olympia on 2nd avenue, just a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Great selection of freshly made food & drinks!We agree with other reviewers that the hotel lacks character/doesn't have much liveliness but I suppose it's more of a business hotel and that wasn't an issue for us as we were always out anyway.Aircon was greatly appreciated in the boiling weather! Though the aircon was quite noisy so we couldn't sleep too well with it on.As at most hotels they ask for a card at check in to open an account on for any expenses to be charged to during your stay, what they didn't make clear which I only found out after enquiring/noticing a drop in my account is that they took a hold of £1,400 which is then supposedly returned on check out...though I am yet to get this money back to my account. I'm surprised they didn't mention this amount would be taken as a hold, because whilst it wasn't an issue for me, for others this could be an issue potentially putting some guests in their overdrafts for example.Overall we had a pleasant stay and would probably stay again if in the city.","Jersey, United Kingdom","Tatiana147</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey, United Kingdom</strong>",15,4.0

Cons: we had 3 people in each room, so 2 people stayed on the king bed and the other in the sofa bed (which housekeeping comes and fixes for you).

My husband and I stayed in New York for our 1st Wedding anniversary and this was special for us , I emailed the Hotel explaining this and asking for a wine menu in advance so I could order a bottle of champagne , no reply, I also had a query ref the online booking as something wasn't right, so I ended up sending two emails, contacting them on Facebook- no reply, so had to call in the end to solve the query I had about the room, When we got there there was no acknowledgement that it was our anniversary , I also found out that my sister wanted to plan something special for us, and she tried to contact the hotel with no success and no replies either very disappointing . The male on the desk when we checked in was helpful, but the women were rude, mostly on there personal mobile phones and when I asked a question they were not interested. there were no robes or slippers in our room on arrival which they should have been so I had to request these, the coffee facility was not replenished with new coffee etc The room had a fridge , and safe which I liked, and great views, the bellman, people that handle luggage where very helpful, polite and welcoming . The Hotel is to the east of Manhattan, we walked to most places, and this was fine, I liked the location as it was quite and out of the hustle and bustle . Needs to improve customer service ...",,Derbylou21,15,3.0

If you are planning to see major things such as Times Square or the Empire State Building the walk is a little far but I still enjoyed the city experience.

First of all I booked this hotel at the end of March. Something went wrong with the hotel reservation and 2 rooms were booked. I called to see what was going on. The receptionist made changed to one instead of two rooms. I was told I won't get charge for two. I got charged for two rooms on my card. And I called almost everyday for 3 weeks. Left messages and no return calls and when I did speak to someone, no one can help me besides accounting. I keep leaving messages and no return call. Now it's aprol 20th, time to check in and the reservation manager said she solved the situation and it's going to get fixed. She was nice but it's been 5 days after my stay and no refund yet. It's my birthday weekend and I just want to enjoy my trip. On my last day I got charge $150 on my card.Of course I am already upset. I called the hotel; they said it's a deposit but why am I getting charged on my last day of stay. He said i would get refunded once everything clears. When I checked in they did not tell me I would get charged. I was only told my card would be on file if any damages or services occurs. With my stay the room was nice but I found some trash under my bathroom sink and my room service did not restock my coffee or tea supply. Another con was that I didn't know how go use the Wi-Fi.I do not recommend this hotel go anyone. I did not appreciate the search dog (though I understand the reason).",,Rany M,1,1.0

Its right next to the UN building and has a diplomatic feel as a result. The room I was in, 3527 was huge. Well appointed and stylish. The view was perfect of lower Manhattan.Free WIFI with a $10 charge for faster wifi?? Didn't really see the point in that but the access I had was suitable for my needs. The lobby is stunning and has sniffer dog security. Given the location I wasn't surprised by this and it was nice to see a retriever working every morning! Staff at the front and bell desk were excellent and couldn't do enough.Free coffee in the rooms and a large widescreen tv. The bathroom is well appointed although the shower is in the bath which I thought was strange for a hotel at this level. Iron and board, large laptop digital safe and wardrobe area. Blackout blinds and nets around whole room. AIRCON/Heating in every room.All the usual services are available and there is a coffee/pastry type shop in the lobby. Al in all a great hotel. WE had our room serviced and on one of the occasions our coffee cups weren't replaced or the coffee pods and on arrival our bathroom had no robes and few towels. On the booking the receipt stated the room was for a one person occupancy and I have seen various reports of this when people book for couples. This is common and will not cause you an issue when you turn up as a couple. It just seems to be the way they book the rooms out.I would absolutely stay here again. Just a few tweaks required on the servicing team for the rooms. All in all a great hotel and worth consideration if you are visiting.PS the current taxi fare from JFK is $70ish. Uber is cheaper by about ten dollars but if you can, share an uber from the airport with someone else going to Manhattan. They will drop off on route to the final destination. May charge slightly more for this but will be cheaper individually. Get the app!","Wiltshire, United Kingdom","236philu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wiltshire, United Kingdom</strong>",44,4.0

When we left the hotel we were advised by the reception desk that no charges were made during our stay, only to find out on our way home that $40 has been charged, with no communication as to what this payment is for, no prior warning just the hotel deciding to take payment for something that hasn't been advised, which I find very disconcerting and unacceptable.

The room was clean but we stayed for 4 nights and the cups and coffee making facilities were only replenished once after the first night. A bit disappointing given the hotel's rating and the price of the rooms. Unfortunately, our stay ended on a very bitter note due to a truly unpleasant member of staff. As we were collecting our luggage to head to the airport, a dog sniffed at my leg and, being dog owners and thinking nothing of it, my partner and I stroked its head. The man - in plain clothes- stood with this dog then snarled 'you should have asked'. We then after some confusion and somebody else explaining it to us realised that it was a working dog trained to sniff out explosives. The dog nor the handler were wearing anything that identified him as security or the dog as a working dog, as we normally would in the UK so it was clear to see it was an honest mistake and we apologised immediately for not having realised. Where we're from its not unusual for dogs to be in pubs and hotels. However, this was not sufficient for this member of staff. This member of staff decided not to accept our apology and started shaking his head and verbally abusing us by loudly and aggressively snapping (swear words omitted to get past filtering) 'are you ------- kidding me?' 'Are you ------- serious?' and 'jesus ------- christ'. We were so embarrassed. I know that security, particularly in the US, is taken very seriously but this man was disgusting. It was an honest and not at all serious mistake in the scheme of things but this man treated us with utter contempt. A simple explanation was all that was required but we instead received abuse. Had we not had a plane to catch I'd have taken this up with somebody there and then, but instead I wrote an email from the taxi. This was 4 weeks ago and the hotel has not responded.

Secondly, we dealt with a very sweet Bell man for most of our trip, however the day we checked out someone we had not seen before who insisted before he could check our bags he needed a tip.

I enjoyed my stay and will more than likely return to the hotel in the future. What stood out most to me was the courtesy and professionalism of the staff. People seemed genuinely interested in making sure guests needs and questions were taken care of and, for the most part, with a genuine smile. My room (a corner room on the 37th floor of the “West Tower”) was clean and comfortable and appeared to have recently been renovated. The large bathroom was well equipped and mostly functional. The amenities were of high quality. In the hallway there were a couple of closets and a small refrigerator. Although there was a warning sign on the fridge noting that it was meant for mini-bar use and placement of personal items in the fridge would incur a $50 charge, it was apparent that there hadn’t been an automated mini-bar system in use for some time so I took the risk and placed my own items in the fridge – and there was no charge when I checked out.The work desk was large and functional. I brought my own internet cable so I can’t speak to the quality of the wireless connection. The hard-wired internet speed was great throughout my stay.The bed was comfortable but, for some reason, the sheets didn’t fit and stopped a couple of inches short of the end of the mattress. It was a minor annoyance but it did bug me so I essentially remade the bed each day to adjust the sheet depth… I’m just strange like that.The view from the room was great, with the UN building in the foreground, the East River and Brooklyn in the distance.There were two issues I had with the room that others may find are no big deal but… Firstly the noise from the room next door. The corner room I was in seemed to be able to be a connecting room to the room next door. The connecting door was not sound proofed at all and I could pretty much hear every conversation the guest next door had, which made me aware that they could hear any conversation I had as well. I found this distracting to say the least. I don’t know that the guest next door was particularly loud but that didn’t seem to matter. This may only be the case in regards to connecting rooms (because of the door) and may not be an issue for other rooms in the hotel so it shouldn’t necessarily be a deal breaker.Secondly, the heating/cooling system in the room did not function too well for me. There is a touch screen panel on the wall with a pleasant display that provides a series of buttons to control the temperature for cooling and for heating as well as a means of controlling the fan speed. I went through all sorts of combinations to try and get a sensible setting for the room (it was reasonably cold in the city during my stay with intermittent snow and rain). I found that, when I tried to set a given heating temperature and fan speed the system would simply stare back at me for several minutes until I walked away from it. It’s possible it was shy or simply slow to respond but it was frustrating. Also, the “Current Temperature display setting for the room never varied from 73 degrees Fahrenheit, despite the room being obviously either much warmer or colder that than. I managed to get it to either get very warm by setting the Heat way up (77 degrees) or very cold by switching to “Cold” and setting the temp way down (69 degrees) but it was a challenge. Finally, I really want to find a place where I can set the fan on low or medium continuously when I am in the room for some background noise and also set the temperature for the room. It seems you can have one or the other, but rarely both.I had breakfast and dinner at the Ambassador Grille restaurant and enjoyed all meals there as well as the excellent service from the staff. I can heartily recommend a meal there whenever the restaurant is open. I also used the “Grab and Go” café many times for various coffees, fresh fruit and other small items. The staff there were also great and I have nothing but praise for the service and the food/drink there as well.The issues I experienced were minor and wouldn’t stop me from trying the hotel again but if they persisted it might put me off in time.","Fairfax, VA","JGVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, VA</strong>",15,4.0

The rooms are well appointed and cozy with very comfortable beds and nice furnishings. The bathroom, while on the small side is well equipped and modern. Although I had requested a high floor room with a view of the city, the room that I eventually received instead wasn't that bad of alternate choice (a room on the 30th floor facing the East River and Long Island).

The first time I booked the room using Priceline's ""Name Your Own Price"" feature, and so did not know what hotel I was getting until my offer was accepted. This time I booked directly through the hotel's own website, because I knew I wanted to stay here again.The first time I stayed, I had a room on the top floor with an astonishing view of the East River and Long Island City. This time I stayed two floors below, with a similar fantastic view. The first time I stayed, the room was tranquility itself, and I didn't hear a sound from outside the room. I am very happy to say that two floors down, the same peace and quiet prevailed.After I caught my breath from looking at the fabulous view, I began to notice other features of the room. First of all, the room size is large, and easily accommodates a king sized bed with bedside tables on either side, two chaise lounges piled with pillows which flank the large window, a caramel colored leather wingback chair, a sleek desk with an office chair, a pole lamp, and a small round table. The furnishings are sleek and there is no art on the walls, but with the view of the river, art would have been superfluous. The room color is a calming taupe but the accent wall is a deep cinnamon, which gives the room warmth. The room is well lit, and each person has their own reading light. All lights can be controlled by a small panel set into the wall which also controls the room temperature. The TV is wall mounted over the desk and offers Netflix.The room had plenty of closet space with both shelves and hangers. A small room safe is also provided. Opposite the closets is a small coffee bar area with an empty mini fridge below it. Although (thankfully) empty, the interior of the fridge is still cool enough to store snacks. There is a coffee maker, with a supply of Illy Café and two nice sized mugs. Tea is also supplied, however to my dismay, there is no electric kettle. However, the tea provided is from the Parisian firm of Dammann Freres, which makes wonderful teas.The bathroom is a dream. The walls and floors are covered in a travertine inspired tile. The quartz vanity offers plenty of space to work. The water glasses are beautifully decorated with a swirl pattern, and are definitely not your standard hotel drinking glass. Underneath the counter is a shelf that is great for storing personal items, thus clearing the counter above. The modern toilet is by Duralit. The faucets in the walk-in shower are by Grohe, and include both a hand-held shower and a rain shower. The drain on the side works perfectly and is out of the way so you don't have to step on it. Also provided were two comfortable bath robes.As noted by other reviewers, the hotel is very close to the U.N., and is quiet. However, it is only about a six minute walk from Grand Central Station, and so convenient to the subway. About 2 blocks up from the hotel at 3rd. Ave. and E44th Street is a Pain Quotidian, one of my favorite chain restaurants, serving organic and very delicious food.All of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and gracious from the moment when I arrived until the day I left. I did have one small problem with housekeeping, which was quickly remedied when I notified the night manager of it. All in all, the staff were smiling, friendly, cheerful and accommodating.The next time I come to New York, I will definitely want to return to the One UN New York.","Williamsburg, Virginia","Berkeleytraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williamsburg, Virginia</strong>",101,5.0

The grand entrance with its marble, stainless steel and glass interior appears dark when walking in from the street but when your eyes become accustomed to the myriad reflections and skilful lighting you feel like you are permanently in a Rolls Royce interior. The staff are polite and efficient, even the housekeeping teams keep a discreet distance and there are no unsightly trolleys abandoned in corridors for hours at an end. All employees said good morning and the internal coffee outlet barristers were a delight. Plenty of waiting space in the lounge although the bar was a bit on the pricey side.The corner room we occupied on the 31st floor was amazing with dual aspect views over the East River and the United Nations Building. Leaving the drapes open we woke to New York waking up and lazy river traffic ploughing through the still grey water. The bed was amongst the most comfortable I have ever spent a night in and the bathroom beautifully appointed. The floor at our corner of the building was very quiet and once the corridor door was closed we were totally isolated from the world outside. We felt pampered and spoilt and stress free.

I heard him on the phone say specifically ""we would like to see if there is a same priced room on the other side of the building"" They were very accommodating and said that we could come down and exchange keys. When we got to the new room we were surprised because it was bigger and had the awesome view we wanted. When we got back and checked our bank account we saw there was another charge from this hotel for $50!! There was no mention of an upcharge and we clearly stated we wanted the same price room over the phone. We just thought it was really great customer service for giving us this upgrade and we wouldn't have moved had we known there was an extra charge.

We pitched this to our son saying ""this way you get to see BOTH views -- East Tower river view tonight and West Tower city view tomorrow. Both rooms were great.

There are two towers with different views. I recommend trying to stay in the West tower with views of the City. After I arrived, we walked in the door and it was odd to have a dog sniff my lady's bag but we thought it was funny. I was immediately greeted by Justin who was ultra helpful. My lady had reserved a room for two others who was accompanying us. While my lady went to another person to help, Justin asked me about our reservations and wanted to help get us on the same floor in the same tower. I requested a high floor in the West tower and was initially going to go to the 38th floor. My lady returned with our guests room number and it was in the East Tower on the 19th floor. So Justin sprang into action to help us out after my lady realized the difference. We upgraded to a 2 story/2 room suite on the 29th floor that was amazing. We had 180degree views of Midtown, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn. The room was modern and cozy and one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in. Justin was just as awesome with recommending things to do in the area and being there if we needed anything. I also stopped by just to chat with him while he worked overnight.

I had a room on floor 38 and had a view of both the Hudson River and the Empire State Building. This was the best view at a NYC hotel that I've stayed in. I love that it's in a less busy neighborhood and also very easy to leave the hotel and get to LaGuardia. I would absolutely stay here again.,"Madison, Wisconsin","kailx003</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",1,5.0

The room is spacious, the bathroom is huge (that spa feeling) and it's very quiet. O and I had a perfect view of the Hudson River (it's really beautiful at night). This hotel is one of the safest hotel because it""s actually linked to the UN Embassy which is highly full of security so I had no problem staying here at all. If you like to walk it's about a 20 min walk to Times Square (also depend on how fast of a walker you are). The employees there are great too, they'll help you any way they can.","Lindenwold, New Jersey","gina B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lindenwold, New Jersey</strong>",0,5.0

This also has to be one of the safest hotels in the city which was very reassuring. would definitely stay here again when we come back. Close walk to everything and we booked last minute and the price was super reasonable compared to much smaller rooms we have stayed in in the past. The first night the room next to us was very loud and inconsiderate, they had security at their door in a matter of minutes which was very much appreciated. Parking was also very reasonable.",,Derek G,1,5.0

This hotel is located one block from the entrance to the UN, so was quite convenient. It is also within walking distance of Union Station, and several good restaurants. The staff was very friendly, and the room was quite spacious, especially for NYC standards. From our window we could see the Chrysler building, the Empire State building, and the new World Trade Center.","Fairfield, Pennsylvania","John G K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfield, Pennsylvania</strong>",25,5.0
