I'll get right to the issue I had: the water in the shower and the sink (both Hot and Cold) became scaldingly Hot. I was taking a shower and everything was fine but then the water became too hot. I tried to adjust it but it didn't become cool or cold. Just very hot. And I mean dangerously hot. Ok. Not great but I was able to sponge off the soap and figured I could wash my hair in the sink. Nope. The water coming out of the faucet was also only Hot. No cold. I called Front Desk from the hotel phone. Got connected to an operator named ""Maria"". She said an engineer would be up shortly. Called at 8AM and by 8:30AM, no one had come. So I dressed and went to check out. Front Desk person really didn't seem to take me seriously. Offered zero compensation. But he did say ""Have a nice day."" Very frustrating.","New York City, New York","CWConnolly0100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,3.0

The location of the hotel is ideal. 9th Avenue next to it can look pretty run down but the places to eat around there are great! We ate in the Westway and also Hudson's Bar and Grill. Would recommend both of these, especially Hudsons. We also had take away from the Lincoln Deli on the corner and it was amazing. Just disappointed we chose this on our last afternoon. The breakfast is not extensive but is good enough to get you set up for the day. I had bagels with Philadelphia or peanut butter and jam most days. My husband opted for the eggs and sausages. I was really disappointed that there was no bacon available the whole time we were there. The coffee is really nice too and is available all day which is perfect for when you get back from a long day. It is actually nicer than Starbucks!We had issues with our room due to water coming into the bathroom from the room above. Also on check in they asked us if we wanted our room cleaned every day or would we prefer a late checkout instead. We opted for the late check out and just had to ask at Reception to get our bins emptied and towels changed. We had to chase things up with Reception a few times and it looks like they either don't communicate with maintenance and housekeeping or maintenance and housekeeping don't listen. The room we had was absolutely fine and while it was small it was still ideal for what we needed. A bath would have been a bonus after a long day out walking. We had paid for a city view but the view we got was looking at the building across the road. No city view at all. I will take this up separately with hotel.com. Also the noise from outside can be quite bad especially with fire engines and police cars. I asked at reception for ear plugs and they were able to provide me with them. Not the hotels fault at all, just the area it is in.All in all if you are looking for a place to crash while you visit NY and don't want to spend a lot of money I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",United Kingdom,"Nicola52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

The room we was fine with little noise, which we were grateful for being in times square. AMAZING SHOWER. Comfy beds. Room was a little small for two people, but it's fine as you don't spend much time in your room when you're in NY. The hotel is massive and with only 2 lifts which was a little annoying but being in NY you don't spend too much time at the hotel so wasnt an issue. The big issue for me was after agreeing to the go green policy at check in, (no housekeeping for duration of stay and you get a late check out as a reward, which I thought was great, as I'm all for the environment and late check outs) I was gobsmacked when it was evident that there was no go green policy whatsoever at breakfast. Paper plates which are not reusable, single use plastic knives and folks, single use coffee cups, is it too much to ask when I'm paying for breakfast to have a normal plate, knife and folk so I can cut my waffle? The breakfast itself was poor to say the least, but giving the cost of our stay I honestly cant complain, I simply grabbed a coffee and bagel and left. If you're looking for a cheap stay in NY, if you need somewhere simply to sleep as you will be out all day and night, and don't mind going elsewhere for breakfast, Hampton inn is your hotel. But if you're environmentally conscious, maybe don't stay here. ","Swansea, United Kingdom","529bolt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Swansea, United Kingdom</strong>",25,4.0

When I went to check out I asked the front desk about these charges and she stated they will all be removed and I will only be charged for the night of $126.88. Days later I check my statement and I have been charged $126.88 PLUS $172.12. I called numerous times to the hotel and left voice messages until I finally got ahold of someone. They said that they will check and contact me back. I received an email stating that the safe (which i NEVER used or touched) was “broken” and that is why I am being charged the extra $172.

Stayed here recently for 4 nights. Location is so convenient. On a block with other properties, in fact there are 3 together 1 after another. All 3 are currently under refurbishment with scaffolding in front covering so a little difficult at first to see the correct entrance. Lobby is small(ish) but has a couple sitting areas. Check in desk is split by a large column, so creates a break in line of sight in case. Initial check in was rough, not the warmest welcome and actually a little standoffish. Follow up with all other staff was better. Welcomed back each time upon entering, hello from everyone! Breakfast was traditional HI offerings. Staff worked extra hard to keep it all clean and stocked in this smaller breakfast area and did a good job. As others have stated, seating is at a premium in the breakfast area. King room was fine for 1 but would be tight for 2 people to stash belongs and maneuver around the room. Closet contained ironing board and iron as well as the safe. Bureau had a couple sliding drawers on as well as concealed the fridge. Desk was appreciated. Loads of outlets all over, included wifi was fast and appreciated. Bathroom is small. Small. If the stall shower wasn't narrow enough, there is a grab bar smack in the middle of the wall. There was no way to not touch it constantly when showering. There are 2 elevators for this building. Arrival day, 1 was down and there was an operator working the 2nd. To come down, you had to call the front desk and they would come fetch you as no buttons were working. This was corrected during my stay and both seemed to be working properly. That said, I requested and received a room on a low floor (4th) and took the stairs most of the time to avoid the waits. That worked well until I noticed the handle from the stairwell to the 4th floor was off and laying on the ground. I let them know at the front desk and was told an engineer would be sent to remedy. Returned late that evening after walking the entire city to climb the stairs...to find no handle at all. Trudged back down and got in line for an elevator. Property has an excellent location just need to pay attention to the workings. That said, there was constant sawing and hammering all day everyday (thankfully not at night).

The usual value and quality we expect from Hampton Inn were there. As far as the negative reviews are concerned, remember that this is located in the busiest spot in one of the world’s largest cities. There is construction, prices will be higher, there are poor people, hotel rooms in mid-priced hotels are smaller, and you may have to walk half a block to hail a cab. If you’re not a total rube, you’ll be fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there were ample vending machines, ice, free coffee/tea/hot chocolate 24/7. One of the elevators was out, but stuff happens. You squeeze yourself into the next available and have a good laugh. The rooms are clean and have coffee makers, a safe, a closet, a huge tv, free Wifi, an iron and board, outlets near the bed, a desk and chair, a refrigerator and an ice bucket. The bathroom was well-stocked. The rooms are smaller than other Hampton rooms we’ve stayed in, but keep in mind that we’ve stayed at another boutique hotel where the door barely cleared the bed when opened! Again, space is precious in this metropolis. Breakfast is free, but the eating area is small and cramped and the food is standard meh. On a busy day you can just take your food back to your room to eat or visit one of the various diners within walking distance. The only negative about the stay is that the staff could warn customers ahead of time that one of the elevators was out and to plan for an extra wait.
