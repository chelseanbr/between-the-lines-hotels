This is in fact not available..everything is closed up and outside food orders get dropped off on a table with everyone else’s orders, purchases, etc.I’m Disappointed & hungry but not surprised.Also, Rooms (while clean like you should expect anytime) are tight and bathroom door hits the toilet.

Actually, they’re going just a bit further. Along with remaining open during these uncertain times when most of us were ordered to stay home, they are hosting Healthcare Workers, providing information regarding transportation to Hospital facilities and complimentary dinner for registered guests. These unsung heroes are coming into work everyday to support the Essential Workers currently at the forefront of this crisis. During my stay I had to make my Very First groggy noise complaint about a fellow guest in the middle of the night. I became frightened being woken up by what I thought was fighting or roughhousing at 12am and again at 3am. The Guest Service Agent who answered the phone was alert, professional, and patient when I called both times. I’d like to take this opportunity to mention: Q, Olivia, and Stacy (I may not have remembered her name correctly ☺️) who were professional and helpful. I read many years ago that 80% of loyalty to a brand is due to Service Recovery. As a traveler and simply as a human being, I’d like to share my favorite quote from Maya Angelou. “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” Thank you so much Park Central Hotel!","Brooklyn, New York","Nikki_Travels_Well</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",3,5.0

It has such a calming and relaxing atmosphere. The staff is exceptional and they always go above and beyond for my needs. They are all very attentive, professional and kind. I always come back to a clean and comfortable room with fresh sheets. I also have a beautiful LED mirror in my bathroom, my selfie game has been on point because of the mirror. My room is spacious with a great view of Times Square. Times Square is only 4 blocks away from the hotel and also Central Park is just a 5 min walk from the hotel. The location is prime! The hotel really became a home away from home. The housekeepers were exceptional! I also had an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel at the hotel.

Cheryl at the front desk was amazing. She’s an asset to the hotel. The room was clean and efficient. Ten minutes after checking out I called the hotel because I left a brand new necklace that was a birthday gift on the desk in the room. I was connected to housekeeping and security who located my necklace. Trudy from housekeeping took my credit card number and address to send me my necklace and that’s the last trace of my necklace. Numerous phone calls and emails failed to produce any answers.

That was our bigger struggle during our New York trip.On the other hand, there are only two elevators available for all the guests, so you have to wait a lot to go to your room or outside.

I thought for sure he broke the bank for this trip but I finally got the pricing out of him. All I can say is WOW, for the price, I don't think it can be beat. The hotel itself is really nice, the staff is wonderful and very helpful and did I mention the location? It's probably a 3 to 5 minute walk to Times Square and about, if I remember correctly, a 5 to 8 minute walk to Central Park. There are great places to eat and even get midnight cheesecake right around the corner. I usually stay in the East Village area, Alphabet City and the like, or Queens. You can get a lot for your money in the East Village. All that being said, this was the best week of my life. You really can't go wrong with Park Central Hotel.

Unfortunately, there was one issue regarding my room which wasn’t dealt with in a timely manner which was absolutely inexcusable for what a quick fix it could’ve been, BUT that being said- I recommend not responding to any texts sent from the hotel if you have a complaint or trying to communicate issues with them that way. Even guest relations were overwhelmed and had to be asked a couple times to deal with my issue. Instead, if you have a big/consistent problem, ask for Darren who was beyond wonderful. He’s the hotel manager and it’s very obvious how much he cares about the quality of your stay. He was quick to fix the problem I had been dealing with and communicated with me every step of the way.

Our room was clean and nice. The hotel in general is clean and nice, and is within walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. It is not directly by Central Park though. The bar is beautiful, and the cafe next door is really good.That said, we experienced a number of issues with this hotel:-The staff: Aside from the room service staff, everyone else in this hotel seemed angry or like they were doing you a favor to help you. Basically, they were rude. -Expect to wait for a very long time for an elevator. We were on the 8th floor, and people were waiting so long for the elevator to arrive, they chose to take the stairs. Us included. In fact, this is the worst wait for an elevator I've ever experienced, hotel or otherwise.-Our room key deactivated itself at least 5 times over our 2-day stay. One time, after numerous attempts at reseting a card, they ended up sending security up with us to let us in our room. Just like the elevator, this was the worst experience I've had with a room key.-Even though our room looked nice, there were issues. The hardware holding the shampoo and soap bottles in the shower kept falling apart. Very frustrating when you're taking a shower. Also, the shower curtain was too small for the shower, meaning that the floor was soaking wet when you get out of the shower, and it took multiple towels to soak the water up.-Speaking of towels, we called the front desk to get towels delivered one morning, and 20 minutes later we still had no towels. Called again. Fifteen minutes later, no towels. We finally went down to the front to retrieve our towels.

Check-in the staff were offhand and not particularly friendly. Room and bed were large but the aircon unit was the noisiest I have experienced so was turned off immediately. No proper bedding on the bed only a sheet and thin blanket (we went in January whilst it snowed). The next morning we asked at reception for a blanket to be sent up as we had been cold the night before, to be told the aircon would also heat the room, I informed her that it was too noisy and could we have a blanket. The blanket was dumped on the bed still on a hanger when we arrived back. When we checked out we were charged the facility fee, I am at a loss as to what this fee was actually for.

Upon arrival we were greeted with smokers outside the front lobby and a major construction site. Checking in was simple and quick. Then we were off to the 1...yes the 1 small elevator that serviced the property the full 4 days we were in town. My mom is unable to climb stairs so we had to wait up to 10 mins each time to use the elevators. We asked several times about service on the other elevator and were told "" We aren't sure when service will get here""....really? Lines were lonnnng to the elevator! When you'd leave your room, again would have to wait 10 mins or longer for the 1 elevator to stop on your floor and have room for you. WIFI didn't work the whole time we were there as well. The rooms are completely outdated and dirty. We laid towels out on the carpet for a walk path because the carpet was so dirty. The sheets had holes in them and pillows are completely flat. We had 2 towels in our room and no wash cloths. So weird! I will say the cleaning ladies are extremely nice. I'm not sure if this hotel needs a new manager or what the issue is but definitely not a 4 star NYC hotel. After all of this at check out we were charged $174 fee....fee for what? No WIFI? Long wait lines at the elevator?? Holes in sheets?? Flat pillows?? I have reached out to the manager to have this fee refunded to me but no luck as of yet and we checked out Sunday.

Carpet in the breakfast lounge is much like your parents in 70’s just theirs has been replaced several times & this had lots of use & everywhere is the same. To eat here is extremely expensive maybe no more than comparable hotels but quality has to reflect that, $80 for breakfast is just too much. We were on the 24th floor & it was noisy if your a light sleeper try & get a higher room.When you check in they tell you that you’ve got $40 to spend in the hotel, two coffees & muffins costs @20 so it’s just a ploy to get you to spend more than your $40 trying to get it back.Make sure the $40 comes off your bill when you check out as they’ve already got your credit card & want to charge it to that.Excellent position for what we wanted to do, staff pleasant & everywhere was clean.Never a 4* in our opinion maybe we’ve been lucky elsewhere, suggest the hotels stop saying services are included when clearly they’re not otherwise there would be no need for mandatory charges.

It's about a five minute walk to the entrance of Central Park and about 10 minutes the other direction, takes you right into Time's Square.

I wish I never had. The first hurdle was construction in front of the hotel with no way to pull your car up to unload. We had tried to call the hotel earlier to determine if they had valet parking, but for hours, we only got a busy signal so we decided to take chance. No luck. After parking elsewhere, we arrived to find chaos in the lobby. The people at the front desk, while not outwardly rude, seemed as if they were annoyed with having to register us. The elevator situation is awful with people crowded into a small space waiting for only two elevators. The room was comfortable enough, but the first night, the party in the next room started singing and shouting with loud music at 4:30 a.m. I called to reception to ask them to send security. A half hour later, when nothing happened, I called again. I was told they were on their way. A full hour after my first call, I called again and was again told they were on their way. I asked whether they were coming from Hoboken! At that point, my husband got dressed and went down to the front desk. Shortly after that, I heard security knock next door. The music stopped, I could hear talking, and then security left. Ten minutes later the music was back on. We later went to reception and asked to have our room changed because I couldn't go through another night like that. The man at reception waved me away to a customer service desk. After much maneuvering, another room was reserved for us but we had to check our luggage as the room wasn't ready. The second night was better but we couldn't wait to leave. I was hoping we could get a bellman to get us a cab since the street was blocked with construction, but no bellman, no doorman. We walked a block to get a taxi.

It’s the perfect location and its easy to find with a huge bar and sitting space for quick client meetings . This visit was a slightly different because of the construction around the building and some reservation changes that I needed to make due to my clients scheduling. My secretary had tried to update my reservation several times but was unable to connect with a person who could help and was connected to several voicemails or the central reservations people who said they could not help her and they justified this because the reservation was from a booking agent and not from them. This explanation didn’t resonate with me because the issue was more so not being able to get a live person from the front desk and being connected to voicemails. When I got there I was obviously shocked because of the massive roadblock and construction fencing at the entrance. At reception I told the lady of my frustrations and I’m not sure why but I was asked to wait for a manager and became frustrated because it was taking longer than I anticipated. I have stayed here before and there have been hiccups but this was annoying and I complained, the lady at reception Jet? Offered me a drink while I waited and eventually I was put in contact with Mr. Hightower who remembered me from a previous visit?? Listened to me and reassured me that he’d take care of the room request and make sure my stay would go well. He issued me his card and less than 10 minutes returned with my room keys, a gift bag and said that my preferences were noted and the room I was assigned to was away from the noise and on the side of the hotel with the faster elevators and asked me to give him my secretaries information to help her with last minute changes in the future- wow!

We reserved the Premium Corner with two Queens. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and open. The hotel has scaffolding around it that interrupted our room view slightly. If we had known it was under construction we wouldn’t have splurged for the view. We were very disappointed in the cleanliness of our room. There was old toothpaste splattered on the bathroom door and walls. The tub had grime inside and the shower sounded like a machine gun when turned on. There was also lipstick smeared on the door. The cabinet under the sink was corroded and peeling. The window tint in the shower was also peeling off. There was a significant layer of dust on our headboard and the desk lampshade had food splattered on it. Our comforter had black dirt on it. I expected this hotel to be of higher quality, especially for over $400 per night. I spoke with Guest Services who offered a discounted rate, waived the facilities fee and a reclean. We were happy with that and left for the day. We returned later in the day to to a clean bleach smell and clean linens. However, nothing else was really tended to. We contacted guest services again. They kindly offered to comp one night stay. We accepted the offer as we were running out of time on our trip and didn’t want to move to another room or hotel.

Every time she would give us confirmations of what she had done via what’s app. So Khianna if you get to read this thank you so much. A couple of gripes, the Wi-fi didn’t work in our room on the 8th floor, eventually got sorted out. The scaffolding outside was a bit of an eye saw but not the end of the world. Also wasn’t expecting the outside noise to be quite so noticeable, again not the end of the world, I’m guessing it’s just typical New York life!One last thing could have done with some tea/coffee facilities in the room that you even get for free in most other hotels, would have been nice to start our busy New York days with a cup of tea or coffee.

There are a few tips/thoughts I have to share about staying here...When checking in, stand between the two green boxwoods in the front of hotel and wait to be called over to the desk. We did not realize this because we were brought in from the side, where the sister hotel that connects is located, (after dropping our vehicle off for valet.) A worker behind the front desk very bluntly and rudely told us where we should be...we literally just walked in and we’re trying to figure out where to go....not a great first impression...but it got better. Carolyn checked us in and out; she was very fast and efficient and friendly. She answered every question I had and was very patient.  I booked two rooms for this stay, requested early check-in for both, not really sure if rooms would be ready early but one actually was...I was so happy about this!!! Also when booking, I requested high floors with views; the only disappointment I had is that only one of our rooms had a good view. I even asked to be moved after seeing our room...front desk was supposed to be contacted but never reached out. If you want a coffee pot and coffee in your room, simply ask! They will accommodate!!! Also, Starbucks is two doors down from hotel. The small sandwich/pastry shop in the hotel was good but is more like a grab and go. There are good restaurants nearby-The Redeye Grill has a great breakfast. Ask for extra towels daily. Elevators are a little slow but our wait was not bad to go up/down. Just research this hotel on the website and call to ask specific questions before booking, so you know more of what to expect. The bellmen/doormen were wonderful to help us get our luggage in/out and our vehicle parked and brought back to us quickly. I think Bobby helped us—cannot remember his name—but phenomenal service.The front of the hotel is under construction but it was not a problem for us. I didn’t hear noise at night either but I also brought a sound machine and have a sound app on my phone to drown out noise. The only problem we had was making a right turn to the sister hotel so we could valet the vehicle upon arrival. The street was closed and we told the policeman we had to get to our hotel so she let us by. We were asked daily during our stay if we needed anything and every request was made, with exception of room change. Thank you Kurt, Michaela, Mandenise, Erika! Location is great. Very clean & modern—Gloria was our housekeeper—what a sweetheart! All the staff who helped us have been very well trained; they work hard to accommodate, give them a raise—they deserve it.

Close to subway station. Reception nice but underging some building work so lots of scaffolding and unable for taxi to stop outside. First room was simply grubby and tired - complained and were instantly moved to a slightly bigger and better room so fair enough - still looks tired though. comfortable beds - lifts bit slow and small for number of guests. Had pre ordered breakfast but not realised this is just a muffin coffee a piece of fruit from the small outlet in the foyer. Was ok but otherwise buying from there pretty pricey. Had to request coffee and tea making stuff - wasnt in the room but again sorted with minimum fuss. Just would expect that as standard in this class of hotel. Overall ok sort of sums it - staff mostly pleasant and helpful but not always. Rooms ok but far from standard I was sort of expecting. Excellent position though.

If you don’t want to walk, the subway is very close and easy to figure out. There is a cute boutique right beside the hotel along with two coffee shops (Starbucks and Tissere). There is also a little cafe inside the hotel. There are several restaurants within walking distance. If you come here around Christmas I recommend that you check out Haven Rooftop. If you are looking for a liquor store, Oak and Steele is a 2 minute walk with a good variety of liquor and wine. Room:We had a standard room (2 doubles or 1 king - we had 2 doubles). A mini fridge is available upon request and dependent on availability, however we were lucky enough to get on. The room and bathroom were both very clean and pretty. The TV allows you to cast your phone which is awesome for listening to music and watching Netflix. Our floor had an ice machine and a vending machine (for drinks) which was very convenient. Our room was restocked with towels and beds were made every day which we really appreciated. We never had to ask for anything.

But, they have been on under construction and have not disclosed this on their website. Our driving could not even drop us off as the entrance was blocked by barricades from the street. He had to beg the doorman at the hotel around the corner to allow us to be dropped off there and walk around. It says there is food. No just a bad convenience store and a lounge, no food that only serves if you are at the bar. The rooms are dark, can't tell when daylight is. The bathrooms have no fans so if there is more than one to shower you will never see in the mirror, even if you could the bathroom is red dark red so you cant see well in the mirror if you are a woman trying to put on make up. I ended up using my mirror and putting it on while sitting on bed. No mirrors in the rest of the room. Also no doormen either. There are other hotels close by and they may cost a few extra dollars.

I literally couldn’t wait for our nyc weekend and thought I found a gem in the heart of NYC but I was so wrong. I called the hotel a few days prior to check in to ask about the valet parking. The morning of arrival we pulled up only to see that the front entrance is completely under renovation and there was nowhere to pull over, we pulled around to the side of the hotel and there was no one there, just a bunch of cabs. We did two laps before a valet from another hotel told us that we have to go inside to the front desk and tell them we are checking in and they will come out to get our car. Um, what the heck? First of all that is completely inconvenient and would have been nice if the person on the phone told me that. We finally go to check in, our room wasn’t ready which was fine, we were early. My boyfriend, a military vet who served three tours overseas, asks the gentleman if they offer a military discount to which he answered “yes but you would have needed to book that ahead of time.” I get it,but seriously, someone is asking and it’s something that you offer for a reason, you couldn’t have honored it? That left a really poor taste in my mouth. The only thing he could offer was an early check in for $100. When our room was finally ready, we check in and ask the bellman to grab our bags, to which he starts dragging them on the floor to bring to us. If they were too heavy please ask for help, don’t drag my stuff! We finally get to the room and it’s a room with two beds, I booked a king. I call the front desk and the concierge, she transfers me to the front desk where I am on hold for five minutes before I am disconnected. I call back, voicemail. So now I have to back downstairs and I am pissed at this point to say the least. The front desk claims I booked a “deal of the day” where there is no room assignment Until check in. I definitely didn’t book anything that said deal of the day, did I book the best available rate, yes of course I did, with a photo of a king bed. I wait to speak to a manager who literally could have cared less and sent me on my way. The only way they could help me was if I paid for an upgrade. Again, the only time they can help you with anything is if you want to pay extra. I go back to my room and check on their website and low and behold they have rooms available for tonight, at a lower rate than what I paid, and king beds available. The manager claims i was upgraded to a room with two queens instead of the two twins that I booked, I have a queen at home, these are not Queen beds. The room is tiny, the bathroom even tinier and I am looking out the window over roof top machinery. Do yourself a favor and RUN! There are a million other hotels in the area, stay at one of those. My stay isn’t even over yet, wondering what else can manage to happen here before we head out tomorrow?",,Nicole P,1,1.0

Can’t rate the bar or coffee shop as we didn’t use them . Check in was rapid even though we were a bit early and the room was comfortable. There was scaffolding outside the hotel and a work platform was directly outside our window which meant we had to keep our blinds drawn causing the room to be a little dark. The scaffolding didn’t otherwise impact on the comfort of the hotel.I think our only complaint would be the additional facilities charge that was added daily to the room rate basically for using things that we are used to having included.

The attention to the guest and their satisfaction with their time and stay was unlike anywhere I've ever been, and I've traveled all over the world. There was a real connection with every employee. They asked me many questions about my stay and how they could improve if needed. And I must say they all seemed so happy, that they were actually really enjoying their time on the job at the hotel (has to be the new management because that's the first thing management fixes...employee satisfaction in their job!!). It meant a lot to feel like I was ""family"" and not just a ""head in a bed""...My room was perfect,. King bed, great bathroom, lots and lots of clean white fluffy towels, great tub. Very clean.

Its also very close to Central Park. The hotel is right on top of a subway station on the NRQW lines so you can get to most places you'd want to go from there. The hotel is hidden behind scaffolding and with major works taking place on the street you cannot get a taxi to the front door. The Premier King room was spacious - very important on an international trip - and spotlessly clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was compact but had a great shower. Lots of street noise despite being 12 floors up. The chambermaids were friendly and did a great job. Only two lifts served the 12th floor so it could take a while to get one in the mornings.The hotel (like most in NY nowadays) charges an obscene mandatory ""facilities fee"" of $40 per night for things that should be included (like storing bags) and things we would never use (like local phone calls, the business centre, and gym). In fairness they are upfront about this but its still appalling.The check-in and checkout receptionists were very unfriendly and robotic (upon checkout we were told to go to the concierge desk to drop off our bags, we said there was no-one there but she told us to wait, only after five minutes when a line formed did she do anything about calling a staff member to that desk).Overall its a good hotel in a good location (if they didnt charge the ""facilities fee"" it may have got five stars)","Navan, Ireland","Robert F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Navan, Ireland</strong>",50,4.0

Things seemed a little unorganised but we were seen quickly enough. We received a nice welcome and all seemed to be going well until the lady that was assisting us picked up the phone and began to scold a colleague on the phone, she swore and had this conversation right in front of us, instead of just waiting for us to head to our room. We were asked for a credit card for a deposit - which we handed over but we got a little frustrated when we realised that no explanation to what the deposit covered or how much they had charged. We stayed on the 16th floor. The room had a huge bed which was comfortable. The only problem with the bed was that there was blood on the duvet cover which I felt was pretty disgusting. I discovered this on the morning we checked out. The rooms are outdated, old and tired. They just simply need a good clean. The carpets are tired, stained and dusty. The shower and bathrooms were small and dark. There was toothpaste all over the walls and fingernail clippings on the towel shelf. The temperature in our room we couldn’t seem to get control over. The room seemed to be naturally warm already and then the air-con blasted out warm air also. Unfortunately I fell ill during my visit to New York. Staying in a room which is at 25degrees celsius when you have a 40 degree fever and unable to open the window wasn’t an enjoyable experience. Annoying, despite there being almost 20+ floors, there are only two lifts in the hotel. So be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for a lift to your floor. If that one doesn’t fill up. We had paid for bed and breakfast. Breakfast consisted on a stale pastry, a bottle of water or a coffee and an apple. A hotel breakfast? Obviously this was disappointing. And there is no tea/coffee or water in rooms either. I bought a bottle of water from the hotel and it cost $7. The hairdryer in my room was broken. Concierge didn’t answer the phone and didn’t return my messages, nor did they replace the hairdryer. We feel that this hotel is in a wonderful location, the neighbourhood is busy and exciting and there are local delis, tourist hotspots and so close to Central Park. Perhaps this hotel would benefit from new management that are excited about running a hotel. From our experience staff are tired and fed up. We stayed in New York for 3 days and travelled from Milan Italy.

Didn't use the bar however drinks prices seemed quite expensive. Room was nice and again modern with chromecast TV which was useful. Downside was that the view from the window looks into other rooms so need to have blinds down most of time and even with them open its very dark which so need lights on all the time. Bathroom is ok, small but it is New York so as expected.

One of the lifts broke down regularly and there was always a queue for the lifts every time we needed to use it. On several occasions we walked up and down the stairs. The hotel doesn't really have much of an atmosphere, the reception area isn't very inviting as there are barely any seats to sit on and there is no food apart from the little coffee shop.

I was however disappointed. First off when I booked I put a note asking for a park view. My husband also messaged the hotel as it was a special trip for my 40th birthday he messaged through email, and messager which took forever to get a response back from the hotel saying there was no park view because the hotel was covered in scadfolding (this would have been good to mention at booking).Anyway not to let it disappoint we left for our holiday, stopping first in Canada. While in Canada I got a confirmation email saying that I had only booked for two adults. I panicked as I had my son too. So I messaged the hotel no reply, and then had to use my mobile to phone them. I got through to central reservations who could not help and told me to phone the front desk, front desk told me to contact inhouse reservations, 5 times I was passed from pillar to post getting cut off each time! It wasn't until I got through to someone else at the front desk she was able to say it wasn't a problem as they don't charge for children. May I say tho when we got into the room it was set up for three with towels!Check in was OK, we arrived early and was given the option of getting into the room and for $90 as it was ready (no thanks). We checked our luggage in and went exploring. Came back to pick up the room key and the guy at the desk was not pleasant at all.Our room looked on to a building site and there was a note in our room saying we may wish to lower the blinds for privacy due to the work and there may be noise which would start at 8am. The first two mornings this did not bother us as we were up early, this morning after three full busy days in New York we could have done without the loud banging especially when my son was knacked.Also I got my period by suprise one day my hubby went down and asked if they had anything to hand until we went to the shop, the hotel does not keep any incidentals like that by the way and was shown the way to the nearest chemist. As for the resort fee, yes I would say its a rip off. $135 for storaging some luggage. No water or coffee in the room (Sheraton in Nigara had water and coffee), no fridge I really don't see how they can get away with charging the extra. I would not say any staff were particularly welcoming or pleasant but to he honest this time we found the most of NY like that. Also everytime you left the hotel the front was full of people trying to get you to buy the buses, and stuff. Surely this could be moved away from the door? The room was fine although a bit dark and bed comfy Yes the hotel is in a good location from the subway and times square but really I wouldnt say I felt I had good value for my money and wouldn't stay here again.

We were told that one was available with a smaller bathroom, so we went ahead and grabbed it, ready to get some rest after a long flight.After our first night in our room, we decided that while we enjoyed the hotel, we didn't like our specific room for a few reasons of our own. We approached the managers the next day to discuss what our options were. Darren helped us out and gave us some options that we could swap to within Park Central or at their neighboring sister hotel, WestHouse. He very patiently and politely walked us through each option, showed us a potential room we could move over to, and took the lead on handling the entire transition to the WestHouse the following day. I had booked through a third party, so there were a few extra steps involved, but with Darren's attentive help, things were handling very smoothly and seamlessly!

While nothing in the US is a patch on what we take for granted in Asia, the staff at the hotel was bad by American standards as well. For instance, the woman at the front desk did not say clearly if breakfast was included in the package or not.We reached the hotel a little after noon and but there was no clarity on whether an early check-in was possible or not(we had put in a request for it). Finally, got the room at 3 pm with the staff advising checking with them periodically (the “confirmed” check-in time is 4pm).It’s an old property and the room was comfortable with the basic amenities.

That should have been my first clue to ask for a refund and run away. Pics below of my ""good view"". I also had no way of knowing there was construction going on. I called the front desk to ask for the name of the lady that checked me in, because i wanted to spk to her about my view and someone stated they couldn't tell me that. Ridiculous, i didn't ask for her SS# or first born!! So i spoke to the manager- Andrew told him of my Good View & he said to go see him the next day before noon to change my room. Like i want to go back down with all of my luggage to check out & check in again. He also said that due to the construction there were no good views. THEN WHY WASN'T I JUST SIMPLY TOLD THAT?? The next morning I decided to sleep in, had my ""do not disturb"" sign on the door knob and as I'm getting out of the shower i hear a banging on my door!! I listen again because maybe it wasn't my door, i had the sign up. I think i heard the door trying to be opened but i always have all locks on and hear someone say ""but no one is in there"". I open my door with a towel on my head and one wrapped around me and the lady looks at me and says ""housekeeping"". I reply NO THANK YOU literally pointing at the DO NOT DISTURB sign. Then she asks if i need towels!! WTH, did the two towels i already had on my body suggest i was in need?

Large, clean with amazingly large bed. Very clean bathroom. Room cleaned daily. Read of problems with lifts but we had none even on the busy weekend. Cafe in lobby was adequate for breakfast/snacks, with plenty of variety locally as an alternative. Can't understand reviews complaining of views from room? You don't go on a visit to NYC for views from your room you go outside and experience the city! Only 2 minor gripes. Firstly safe in our room was broken and still not replaced when we left (room 665), but we worked around this so not a major issue. Secondly, the cafe seemed run out of lots of breakfast food by 8ish and then bring out same goodies about 9ish for lunch. Why they didn't just keep replenishing items as they run out in the morning without the pause? Most people are out and about for luncheon. Only a minor gripe but it meant people went elsewhere locally so hotel lost that revenue.Can recommend the Italian restaurant a block or so to the left or the Stagecoach Tavern to the right for local eating. Would also highly recommend Patsys on 56th st behind Hotel. This is Frank Sinatra's favourite place. Food was best Italian I have ever had, including that in Italy!

It’s close to subway station, couple of short rides to Hudson Yards Vessel; walkable to Time Square; the Big Bus double decker is right by the front of the hotel, was able to purchase tickets and hop on right away (double decker bus is my favorite way to see the city and off the ground away from crowds at popular sites); nice clean room for us to rest after a long but joyful day. A special thanks to Elizabeth at customer relationship. We had some trouble with our reservation through Groupon. She was so patient, helpful and pleasant while helping us resolved the issue.

Overall the hotel is really nice as you walk in and all the staff are very helpful. A lot of people mentioned to me in the lift that they were a bit disappointed in the lack of Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room, but little did they know that if you asked at reception they could provide you with this and a fridge at your request. We were expecting to be charged for this but we weren't so take advantage of it!Being in Manhattan, be expected to pay more than usual and venture a bit out of the way for cheaper eats and drinks. The hotel itself is huge and only has two lifts which can be very frustrating at times, but people have places to go and places to be. I would say if you are feeling fit, use the stairs as there is some really nice Jazz artwork in the stairway. (Floors 3-Ground if I remember).The Room: We had a room with two double beds and it was big enough for us both. It had a few flaws which I would have expected better from a posh hotel. The drawers did not close in the chest or bed side tables. The bathroom mirror wasn't glass, but a sticker which was peeling off and the bathroom also smelt a little bit damp.Cleanliness: I am a bit of a neat and dust spotting freak so I was dusting myself most of the time. I also left a hair on the back of the toilet to see if this would be cleaned...it was there for 3 days!However, we were only sleeping in the room, so to me they are all little things to me, but could be big for others.What I also found weird (may have just been because I have never experienced this before) was that if we did not want our room cleaned for that day, reception left us a message advising that if they did not come the next day, we may be ""charged""? So keep that in mind if you want a lay in!It is a bit on the pricey side for hotels, but it is worth the pennies as it is a nice hotel and the staff are always very eager to help and chat.","Warwick, United Kingdom","Kazz L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warwick, United Kingdom</strong>",7,4.0

Our problem began with the elevators - they were a big pain because out of the two, one elevator was out of service and the other one was extremely slow. Every time we had to wait for at least 10 -15 minutes to get into an elevator. Plus, the elevator would stop at every floor making it very slow and time consuming. The exteriors had scaffolding all over - presumably the building was under repairs!The room size was rather small for a Double room to accommodate four adults - we felt very cramped as there wasn't enough space to keep our luggage and move around freely. Add to it the lighting in the room was very poor and dim because there were inadequate lights! There was no brightness in the room and the dull atmosphere was depressing.The room had no view. The 1st room assigned to us had a very small - prison cell - like window which opened to a wall outside! When we requested for a change, another room ""with a view” was assigned to us, but it was marginally better. The window's size was a little bigger and the view was of the terrace of the adjoining building and the scaffolding of the hotel.The hotel staff declined our one-time request for some empty plates and did not assist us by providing any connectors/sockets to charge our cell phones. Water bottles in the room were also at a charge! Some of the staff 'demanded' tips which was surprising as to tip is the guest's discretion - cannot be demanded nor should the guest be forced to tip.This was the 1st time ever and hopefully the last time that we will patronize this hotel. We had moved in from another hotel in the neighborhood where our experience was far superior and extremely satisfying. Unfortunately, we had managed to get a reservation for only one night there otherwise would not have had to change the hotel.To sum it, we were very unhappy and dissatisfied with the overall stay and experience.","Ithaca, New York","manavdost</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ithaca, New York</strong>",1,1.0

We got the corner room with a nice view but with all the construction equipment surrounding the building it was obstructing, we however didn’t notice any sounds or inconvenience because of all that so kudos !! Lobby and helpful staff are excellent. Rooms are dated with holes in drapes, visible cracks etc but I can ignore those. Liked the $1 breakfast package (pastries, coffee/tea/water) - very convenient. Maintenance/ Housekeeping was very responsive. I read many reviews where folks were misguided by resort fees. We were charged those at the time of booking from hotel site so there were no surprises for us but the only thing I used was WiFi. It’s Manhattan. Even SF union square hotels charge such things - just location based I guess.

Was told it’s been like this a long time and will likely remain that way. If view is a top priority take that into account. Scaffolding and nyc not uncommon but not told under construction. The elevator issue appears to be an ongoing issue at the hotel. ( read reviews Before reserving) The elevator is not working, again and again. You must use the service elevator. There was a wait for that in excess of 15-2o minutes, more than once. If you have an appointment in the city and don’t want to be late, be Early to elevator to try to be on time.

Stayed around this area in various boutique hotels as well as UES because it’s close to Central Park. We checked in to this hotel with my husband Saturday afternoon and our worst NYC hotel experience started. When we arrived at the valet parking, there was another car pulled up in front of us, so we were ignored as if the valet boy couldn’t see a full size SUV right in front of your hotel door. We had to take out all of our own luggage, no trolley for us to use, and no help offered. We dragged our luggage inside, it’s only when we got into the line to check-in, a man hurried over and gave us a slip - which they charged us EXTRA because our car is bigger than standard. See the irony here? When it’s your turn to service us, you couldn’t us even if our car is ‘XL’, but when it’s your turn to charge us, all of a sudden our car is ‘XL’.Fine, a little bit extra, who cares, let’s move on.We dropped off our own luggage in the room, and headed out to Broadway show. BTW highly recommend To Kill a Mockingbird in Schubert. We returned to the hotel room 11:30PM. When we got into the room we heard a high-pitch squeaking noise from the bathroom. Went in to check what’s going on , turned out the shower faucet was making the constant noise. It was so loud that with a closed bathroom door we couldn’t even hear our TV. Called the Maintenance number, lady on the phone told us she put in a service ticket but no ETA for the fix, and that most likely tomorrow morning. I turned on the speaker and asked if she could hear the noise herself. She confirmed she did - so she sent a guy here around midnight. The guy checked around and said there’s nothing he could do right there then. He suggested us sleeping with a closed bathroom door. We asked him to try it himself to see if it’s possible. He realized it’s still crazy loud but he couldn’t do anything. We told him to report this to the front desk and we would need to change rooms.Then the front desk called us, saying they are 100% booked for the night, and no other room available. We offered to pay extra for an upgrade but were refused. The lady offered to waive our resort fee - which is really nice of her but didn’t solve our problem. As we were not ready to repack our luggage again and try to find another hotel room in NYC after midnight, she said she would send us some earplugs. Then a maid came with ONE pair of earplug , when on the registration it clearly said TWO guests. She whined about how she had to go back and get another pair for us , and made us wait until 1:30AM. We were both too tired with the drama for the past 2 hours so we fell asleep with earplugs and headphones of our own music.The next day around the plumber banged on our door SO loud when we were still in bed. Understood he's got his work to finish off as well, we hurried out of the room.When we returned the same night, we didn't hear the noise again so we assume it was fixed. Oh boy were we so naïve. It was only the opening to the worst hotel drama ever. 1:30AM when we were asleep, the Fire alarm went off - wasn't a loud panicking noise, and it only went for four beeps and stopped. Assuming everything was fine, my husband and I tried to go back to sleep because we didn't hear anything in the hallway. However the concierge started to speak on the broadcast saying 'Attention Please! Attention Please! Please Disregard the fire alarm.' It served as a trigger for EVERY SINGLE HOTEL guest to start running around. We could hear footsteps upstairs, screaming in the hallway all of a sudden after that broadcast. The concierge went off to broadcast the exact same message 4 TIMES within 10 minutes. Come on, obviously your message is NOT understood by the guests (otherwise they would have stopped running), say something else? Use some empathy please? Most of your hotel guests are from places where English is not their first language. All they heard is 'Attention……. Fire alarm' , of course they would run!Finally it took him 5 times of try to say 'It is a false alert'. But people were still running, and the chaos finally died down around 2:30AM.Finally we thought we would get some rest - until 4:01AM - the high-pitch squeaking noise in the bathroom CAME BACK - so loud that it scared me and I jumped out of bed. I went to shut the bathroom door and had to put on my headphone + earplug to sleep through the rest of the night.The next morning at 10AM AGAIN, a guy came banging on our door when we were still asleep (after only being able to sleep for 6 hours). Said he was the plumber and tried to fix the problem. My husband was polite enough to tell him that Service Request was sent on Saturday and someone already showed up yesterday - but the problem was not fixed. He immediately took off without even further examine it. Good luck to the next guests in our unit - you are going to have quite a few more nights of high-pitch squeaking noise in the middle of the night from the bathroom.In short, the reason why I wrote out my entire horrible experience is to help some other people to NOT experience it again.

Keep in mind that individually, these items are not that bad but all together, they made for an unpleasant experience when we were expecting a seamless stay.1. Room change with no reason provided. We arrived in our room and promptly received a phone call from the front desk telling us that our room needed to change. No reason was given. We were told someone would be by with our new room key. We waited a few minutes.... no one came. We were just sitting there with our 4 year old, waiting to unpack.... So we called down and were told someone would be by shortly. When we met the employee, he asked us why we were moving as even he didn’t know. This was disappointing after we had waited around most of the day to check in and all we wanted to do was unpack.2. Elevator out of service. 1 of the 4 elevators was out of service for our full week stay. We understand this happens. There was no warning at the desk however and waits for the elevators were quite long every day. To make it more annoying, there was a sign on the elevators telling guests to use the service elevator unless they were carrying luggage. Quite an interesting experience when you get on the service elevator and surprise the employees who are moving dirty dishes and had no idea guests would be using the elevator. Employees we met on the elevator were very nice and we just made a joke out of it. Still, not a great experience.3. TV not initially working. When we arrived in our room and when we arrived in our second room (see point 1.), the TV’s were quite fuzzy, to the point they could not really be watched. Only after we spoke with the front desk, and they sent someone to look at the TV, were we told that they had just changed to a new service and the TV would work fine after being on for a few minutes. Would have been great to receive a warning at check in. Completely understandable if we had known in advance. 4. Under Construction. As many buildings in NY seem to be going through, this building has scaffolding everywhere. Not an ideal view. Would have been nice to have this at least acknowledged at check in. I know the staff cannot prevent this. 5. Tub drain plug kept coming out. This seems very minor, but we had to fiddle with the drain plug to get it to actually work. This was necessary for me to bath my 4 year old. This is the sort of thing I would expect to not have to deal with.6. No floor mat. Some days we would have a floor mat for the bathtub and other days, there wouldn’t be one so I used a hand towel to step on after getting out of the shower. Again, quite minor but annoying when added to other things.7. Key deactivated early. On the day we were set to check out, my husband went to the gym at 6 am. When he came back about 45 minutes later, his key did not work. I’ve never had my key deactivated prior to actually leaving the hotel. Not sure if this is normal?Overall, the hotel was clean and many of the staff we ran into were pleasant. But based on other reviews and the level of hotel, I would not have expected these items to happen or at least not be acknowledged prior to.",Canada,"Nicoby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",1,2.0

I wanted a location that would allow us to walk and only use public transportation but see several highlights (Central Park, Top of the Rock, Statue of Liberty and 9/11 Memorial). We walked 1.5 miles with our backpacks from Penn Station (Amtrak) to the hotel so we could see Time Square on the way. It was totally doable. We saw all the attractions on our list (love that they give you a free hour bike rental w/ purchase of one hour from the place in the same building) and the super sweet concierge gal helped us with questions about the subway and bus (which is free in the summer!). The subway/bus to La Guardia was $5.50 for the two of us versus $60 for a cab. The hotel manager, Daron, was very present and helped when the front desk was busy and when one elevator had trouble (showing us to another). They gave us two queen beds instead of a King (which we preferred) and an end room so we had windows on two sides. Rooms are small as is customary in NYC, but I did not find them cramped at all, and in fact, felt the design was great. View was slightly obstructed by summer maintenance scaffolding, but we still people watched out of them briefly in the evenings.

The hotel is close to Central Park and very close to the subway. All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. Our room was large for typical city size-this is one of the few hotels in the city that actually had 2 queen beds. The room and bathroom were clean and the beds were very comfortable with king sized pillows. The downside was that only 1 (ONE!) elevator was working to get guests up to their rooms. This became extremely frustrating as we had difficulty getting both up AND down to/from our room. (Especially in the 98 degree heat when all you want is to get to your room and relax.) They offered the service elevator for guests to use but that was glitchy also and our average wait for an elevator was ridiculous. Also, the ice machine on our floor never worked, despite letting them know it was down. However when I spoke with a manager about the situation and asked what they were doing to remedy things or to compensate guests, she made an offer that I felt was fair, which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. ( I complained, she responded appropriately and did what she could-that's what you want from decent customer service.)

Windows without a view, overlook, what I can only describe as a junk yard and views into other guest rooms. So had to kee p blinds down most of the time for privacy, which left the room without any natural light.6. Not enough lights in the rooms - very dark.7.

Walking distance to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Macy's, Empire State Building, Central Park and other popular tourist attractions.9. Check-in and check-out was relatively straight forward.10.

I was taken aback by the fact that they added $35 to each day of my stay--a facility fee (or something to that effect). Apparently that's common in New York. Pretty slimy IMHO. The front desk seemed a little embarrassed when I called them on it and asked them to waive it, which they didn't. Other hotel details: Great room, super-comfy beds. Could hear the noise from the street (I was on the 4th floor) but still slept like a baby. The lobby bar had weird hours. Always seemed to have to wait for an elevator as the other 2 elevators were taken over by the Manhattan club, whatever that is. The location is great (near theaters and Central Park) and awful (it's a very high density of tourists, meaning you're constantly getting brochures shoved in your face as you leave the building). Not sure I'll stay there again. That facility fee is pretty unnerving. ","Denver, Colorado","Craig A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",3,3.0

Much of the meeting space is in a windowless basement - fine for an offsite, bad for a wedding. There’s also an odd quirk where some elevators from the meeting space take you to a different adjacent hotel; apparently a common issue since we had it happen to us and saw it happen to others a half dozen times over 3 days. Food at meals was generally not great - greasy sandwiches, wilted salad (one meal it was just lettuce ... really just lettuce), but let’s put that on my company versus the hotel - since our one dinner there featured a surprisingly perfectly cooked filet!I valet parked on arrival and - it turns out at $60+ a night ... ouch, even for NY... and was blessed with a small scratch on my car when it got delivered after a 30+ minute wait.

There is a concierge on between 8-6. On arrival there was a mix up with the room. We ordered a twin accessible room and were assured by our agent that the hotel had arranged this. The room was a king and we were told by the member of staff that took our bags up that all accessible rooms were king. There were no accessible twins so they wouldnt have told the agency this so seems fault lies with agency. He went out of his way to help and arranged for a roll away bed to be brought up, for which we were not charged. The room didn't have a view but made up for by the room itself. Massive compared to other hotel rooms, a large TV, a lovely arm chair with foot rest. The accessible bathroom is great, with a choice of two different showers.

We waited the housekeepers to “clean” our room and they said we will call you when your room is ready. (Which they never did.) After 2 hours we FINALLY checked-in and we went to our room.

I stayed there for 6 nights and the Facility Fee was nearly $250. That then pushes the cost of the hotel into another price tier and it just doesn’t offer enough amenities to warrant being in that tier. After a conversation with Elizabeth and Nancy at the front desk they agreed to waive it. Thank you to them both. The good: when you take the fee out of the equation there is great value for the money here. The basic room is adequate size for 1-2 people with an average hotel size bathroom. It’s nothing noteworthy but it’s very reasonable for Manhattan at the price point (excluding the fee of course). There’s a lounge area and a gym but not a restaurant or much else in the way of amenities (for instance no in room fridge) but again compared to what other nearby hotels are charging, I’m ok with those not being there. The location is perfect for exploring midtown. A 10 minute walk will get you to Times Square, Columbus Circle, Central Park or 5th Ave. There’s a good mix of restaurants within walking distance, both in terms of price range and cuisine. Carnegie Hall, Broadway, Radio City are all within walking or short cab ride distance. Were it not for the Facility Fee I’d probably give them a 5 star rating but I’m taking a star off because when you factor in the cost of the fee, the amenities and size of the room are sorely lacking for what it ends up costing. No fee: 5 star. With fee: 3 star, so I’ve split the difference and given it a 4. ","Chapel Hill, NC","cptspalding</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chapel Hill, NC</strong>",14,4.0

Aside from the usual hand soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner, no other toiletries were privided. No electric kettle in the room, we had to request for one. No chiller in the room also. Another thing I must add is that there were not enough elevators! This is a very busy hotel due to its location. There is a constant line at the elevators.

We chose this hotel because of its excellent midtown location close to Central Park. It didn’t disappoint!I have to say that I’m not a fan of the NYC practice of hotels charging daily fees. It’s far simpler to include them in the room rate, paid up front. I understand it’s not just this hotel, but all NYC hotels, but nevertheless it’s extremely irritating. Park Central did include some extras though, such as a discount at the hotel bar, which was nice. The fittings are in good condition, albeit somewhat dated. If I could point out something, it’s that the shower curtain in the bathroom was too short. We enjoyed our stay in a family room with 2 double beds. The staff were pleasant and friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay easier. There are no coffee and tea facilities in room, but there is a Starbucks on the ground floor, and the hotel lobby also has a small coffee shop. The best thing about our stay was location - Central Park is 5 minutes walk away, the major museums like the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are reasonably walkable distances away too. So is Times Square. For anything else, the subway entrance is practically on the same block. There’s no real reason to stay in the hotel, so we didn’t really make use of any in house facilities.

It is very convenient to the Theater District.The property is an older property but has been very well maintained and it did not feel like an older property. The rooms were clean, quiet, and more than adequate.There is no on-site restaurant, but there are many restaurants within a block or two for breakfast or lunch.The Bar area is very upscale and comfortable. The bar hostess, Nancy, made us feel very much at-home and treated us like family. Meeting her was one of the highlights of our trip!The only real negative to the property is the elevator situation. At one time it appeared that this property had a total of 8 elevators, 4 for each side. There are now only two elevators per side. One side serves the higher floors, one the lower floors. This works OK when the elevators are all working. During our visit one of the two elevators serving our floors was out of service for about a day and a half. This caused major queues to access the remaining elevator.The outside of the building is also under some sort of refurbishment, so our outside view was somewhat blocked by scaffolding and safety screening. We were not in the room much so this was not a major issue.This was our third visit to NYC and our third hotel. If this hotel is available, we will likely stay here on our next trip!","Hudson Oaks, Texas","stevenv599</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hudson Oaks, Texas</strong>",3,5.0

We had booked two rooms ideally adjoining or at least next door or opposite as we were travelling with our two daughters. Whilst I appreciate that these things cannot be guaranteed it was confirmed on our booking. When we arrived we was not even booked on the same floor. The hotel was fully booked and the best they could then offer was to move us to another floor but both rooms were king beds and meant my daughters sharing a bed. The lady checking us in was understanding and went to see a manager. Initially the response was well we don’t guarantee it but it was clear and then they showed us our agent who was far less helpful hadn’t actually even made the request. They offered to move us the following night into the rooms we had booked, whilst waiting only 10 minutes for our temporary rooms to be made ready they gave us complimentary drinks at the bar and vouchers for a breakfast in the morning and were really helpful.The hotel itself is lovely and it’s location is great for exploring the awesome NYC, we especially wanted to thank Nancy who oversaw the bar & took great care of us in the evenings especially our young daughter who she really looked after. We normally stay at a more expensive hotel when in NYC but this does all you need when visiting and will certainly get our business when we return.A great find.","Hadleigh, United Kingdom","JJ3105</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hadleigh, United Kingdom</strong>",25,5.0

I told them to go to reception as the reviews shown how helpful they had been and they would probably move them.

The hotel is very conveniently located across the street from Carnegie Hall, just south of Columbus Circle and Central Park South, and about 10 blocks north of Times Square.

The staff at the hotel has been excellent, and I especially want to acknowledge the expert assistance from front desk personnel Nancy and Darren, and the cheerful housekeeper named Kim. I also wanted to give an honorable mention to another housekeeper who turned in a set of Lincoln Center tickets that I had mistakenly left behind during a room change (complimentary upgrade)! What an unexpected relief it was to get those tickets back in time! This would be a 5-star rating but for the often poor elevator service. The hotel is host to many tour groups and large choruses visiting Carnegie Hall, and the elevators can get very backed up. One additional tip, get the $1.00/day breakfast option if it’s offered.

First of the location is a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park and the Subway entrance is literally 20-30 feet from the front door. Upon arrival we were able to checkin fairly quick ( less then 5 mins ) My room was upgraded one level up and we took our luggage upstairs. The room was king size bed. Very neat and contemporary style. Loved it!! The bathroom was a bit small but that kinda given when it comes to majority of NYC hotels. After staying there for a couple of nights we wanted to change the room because we were facing the 56th St with a office building across from us, I went down to get some bandaids from the front desk coz my girlfriend new shoes gave her blisters (Walking about 20,000 steps) I see a guy by the name Darren at the front desk, after getting the bandaids I brought up my request to him thinking he probably will tell me that he can't do anything blah blah and to my surprise he turned out to be manager and an awesome dude. Very professional yet very helpful. He said he can't guarantee anything but he did make all the necessary notes and suggested that I call the front desk in the AM. Which I precisely did that and than I was transferred to Guest Services, at this point I find myself speaking to another gentleman by the Quimby T. who's in charge of BRAND INTEGRATION AND GUEST EXPERIENCE ( BTW I grabbed his business card don't know what all that really means lol) He was very polite, professional and helpful as well. I was still skeptical until the point he said, I see all the notes made by the manager Darren. He said no worries. we want you to have a pleasant stay and put a room from us with a King size bed for tomorrow ( couldn't do anything for that day because all King Size bedrooms were booked ) on the 16th floor with partial views of Times Square. I was so impressed with the genuine urge to help a guest staying at their hotel. Also when I walked into my new room I can't help to notice a bottle of Champagne and couple of champagne glasses and some chocolate. They really didn't need to do that but the fact that went out of their way specially Quimby to make our stay even more pleasant I can't be appreciative enough. Bottom line is the location is just one of the best traits of staying at this hotel but they have truly exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay here on my next visit to NYC and recommend this hotel if any of you ever stay in NYC because I for sure am.

The first one was at 8am!!I work In the hotel industry and I would have thought it is common and best practice around the world that you do not start cleaning occupied rooms at 7:30/8am let alone have Hsk asking guests what time they’re checking out. That conversation should be had with reception and not the guest.In any case I’ll be back, however I thought some constructive feedback to management was due.",,968janinem,7,4.0

(its been 3 years) Why? The accommodations? Location? Bedding? Cleanliness? Yes, all those are very important to me but what I most treasure is how i'm treated during my stay. The staff here in NYC is by far the Best! No matter when I visit the first man I see when pulling up is Carmello with his smiling face followed by a hug and a warm greeting. (the staff here speaks highly of him to). My car is always parked with care! What a wonderful happy man. Then I see Melania at the front desk. We always laugh for a bit and the happiness she exudes while checking me in is contagious! She is a pure Joy as well! And of course you have Quimby : Guest Relations Executive. I had a problem one time with my car key missing from my key fob when I got home and I had to communicate from home with him to have my key returned. He was just like everyone else...so joyful, happy and accommodating as well. I got my key in 2 days! I usually grab a coffee before going up to my room. Carolyn works at the Coffee Market in the hotel. We always talk, laugh and share a little to. She makes me feel right at home. Each time I pass her she asks if i'm having fun in the City and a good day! Such a wonderful woman. And lastly? Betty. She's in Housekeeping. What another Joyful person to converse with. She is a wonderful listener, happy and inspirational to me as well. What more can I say? I don't mind what the rooms cost, ever! When you come in contact with such joyful people like I do here, WHY would I want to stay anywhere else?

I was absolutely disgusted, and after speaking to front desk got moved to another room which was great. However my issue is that I’m not too pleased about the level of customer service provided. I think the hotel staff hide behind the exterior of “I work at this fancy hotel and you should appreciate being able to stay here” type of attitude. On the night of being moved to another room we had spoken to one of the managers at front desk, I believe his name is Darren and I told him that I was not happy about the cockroach, especially because I’d found it in the bathroom I felt that I couldn’t use any of my toiletries and replaced my toothbrush amongst other things. I explained to him that I felt it fair to have our room fees waived for the duration of our stay. He agreed almost instantly, told us it would be absolutely no problem and to me that was the end of that. Fast forward to the next morning, and I have an email from another manager summarising the events of the night before. The only difference is this new manager claimed that Darren only offered to waive room fees for 2 nights and not the remainder of our stay. When I replied to correct him he disagreed and stated that this was not the case. Even after going down to speak to him at the lobby it was as if he was explaining the conversation I had with Darren as if I had not been there. I even explained that as a business focused on customer services and hospitality they should honour the agreement originally made. However instead we had a manager speak to us in nothing but jargon and try to find a way to okay finding a cockroach in our room. I have to say I’m not happy with this. Especially as I felt that I was made out to look like a liar. What shocked me the most is how kind and helpful Darren was when I had spoken to him, only for him to tell the AM manager a completely different story.

We were told it was quieter and would be better for our longer stay (8 nights). Not sure it the reason was true, but it was quiet, away from any stair wells and lifts and though our view was uninspiring (just looking in to a 'well' of other bedroom windows) we were not in the hotel much at all. So quiet...suited us very well. When there we just wanted to rest and sleep. Room was very comfortable and perfect for our need. The breakfast is from a small shop in the foyer if you choose. You can prepay for breakfast and collect from here but we did not include breakfast in our reservation and were glad. We were able to catch breakfast on the fly, depending where we were going and what we fancied. The shop had a good variety but when buying adhoc, it was expensive. So buying a croissant and tea outside the hotel from a little cafe was much cheaper than the shop in the foyer. I think they had the most expensive banana's anywhere!Hotel was great for us, we slept very well and the couple of occasions we used the hotel bar it was pleasant. Though we did encounter a waitress, who seemed to think an apathetic attitude still justified a 20% service tip.....having ignored us for over half an hour and not just once, I disagreed and she was not happy, but it did not taint our stay.

The moment you walk into the hotel there is this incredible aroma in the air that helps you to transform from the busy streets of NYC into a spa like environment. The people at the front desk greet you like you live there, as park central also has a section of permanent residents, similar to other well known hotels like the plaza. But the gem of this place, hidden discreetly behind the front desk, is the bar and lounge area.

Definitely needed to be brighter. Also, our room was extremely warm. We basically had it turned off the entire time - set the thermostat at 65, but the room was consistently registering at 75. Didn't feel that warm, but it was hard to cool it down. Bathroom was clean, but I think they could have made sure the walls around the sink were wiped down.Some positives to note were:- Very comfortable beds! - Big area with seating and tables on the first floor.- Fast check-in.- Good security. You need your room key to access the elevator.- Starbucks next door if you're into coffee or want a quick breakfast.- Easily walkable distance to Broadway shows. - R and W Subway lines only a block north.- Taxis always available.Lastly, I'd like to send a shout out to the concierge.

Location is obviously the reason why this hotel is so expensive, although it was even pricier than what I’ve paid for hotels in the heart of Times Square. Exterior & lobby/bar are attractive, but the rooms are standard, small NY fare. Rooms were also lacking what I’d consider basic amenities - coffee maker & fridge(extremely frustrating, as we were in NY for an event, and often needed to eat on the fly, in our room). Rooms a bit tired (stains on carpets, walls), and didn’t feel completely clean - the bathroom, for example, felt like it could use an extensive wipe down. I found bed very hard. Wifi was complimentary, although the website indicates that it is a daily fee- this was a pleasant surprise. The coupons for free coffee/breakfast pasty at in-house breakfast area were much appreciated. Cleaning staff were very friendly. We were “upgraded” to a deluxe room (ie., 2 queen beds), but I’m pretty sure the extra bedroom space cut into our bathroom square footage - our bathroom was a similar size to a cruise ship bathroom, and much smaller than other NY bathrooms I’ve had (I was touching the walls every time I got a shower...)","St. John's, Canada","Meaghan M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. John's, Canada</strong>",15,3.0

So, we had never stayed at this hotel before, but we wanted something near Central Park. We found the hotel online, so even with pics on the website, you still never know, right? We were pleased to walk in to a beautiful lobby. Check in was fast and friendly. I wish I could remember the front desk associates name; she was so helpful and friendly! We needed two beds so we chose the Premium Corner Two Queen Room as it advertises higher floors 8th-18th, and would be an exterior room, with some kind of view. Initially during check in, we were informed that there was no guaranteed minimum 8th floor, but she would try and accommodate us. No problem as we were placed on the 11th floor, but this is a disconnect from what is advertised. The room was very nice; windows on two sides (corner room) with a decent view, bright and airy. The room wasn't wide but longer than a traditional room, with an easy chair and desk/chair, and was clean and comfortable! Just like the website photo. This hotel, located on 7th at 57th, is a couple of blocks from Central Park and a short walk to Times Square, Broadway theaters and many restaurants! When looking for hotels in Manhattan, just remember that the Avenues; 5th, 6th, 7th, Broadway, 8th, for example are very long blocks. The Streets; 59thSt, down to 42nd.,are much shorter and a quicker walk! Our friendly concierge was very helpful for restaurants and subway directions, however, be aware the concierge is only available until around 6pm, so help with dinner has to be done beforehand! Upon departure, the doormen were helpful securing a cab, and helped us with our luggage. Additionally, you can store your luggage before check in and get started having fun and leave it there after checkout before you depart! Overall, this was a very nice hotel. Really, everything we hoped it would be! Hints: Use your mobile device for reservations to get the best rate! Be aware there is an approx. $30 facility fee per day.

I checked into the hotel around 11:30 pm. The entire 11th floor smelled like weed. I thought the smell would get better in my room but the smell was no different. In fact, the smell of marijuana worsened throughout the night. Within 2 hours into my stay, at 2 am, I started having a really bad headache due to the smell and went to the front desk about this matter. The front desk gave me two options: clean the room or go to a different room. I requested housekeeping to clean the room because it was 2 am in the morning and I've had a long day due to flights/meetings. The housekeeper spoke to me in a very hostile and threatening manner as she entered the room. She said, ""The room doesn't smell. What are you talking about? Where do you want me to spray?"" Further, she sprayed the odorizer DIRECTLY on my pants as I was standing right next to it. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. I didn't expect this from a 4-Star hotel. I talked to Darren, the manager of Park Central hotel, about this incident. While he provided a waiver of the facility fees, this was NOT a 4-Star experience.

This has never happened in the past. Then he set my bags down on the counter of the desk and went back to the street - which again was a pleasant surprise since at this point I usually get asked if they can bring my bags up or they wait for a tip. Then when I left my room the next day, I ran into the most cheerful housekeeping attendant, Marissa, who was so very pleasant, asked me about my stay and thanks me for coming. This again, never happened before. And when I walked out of the hotel, the doorman wished me a good day and told me to keep warm - and thanks me for staying here.

The lobby and check-in experience were reminiscent of a Four Seasons, and seeing the flashing lights of Time Square down the street seemed almost too good to be true. Little did I know, however, that my first impressions of the hotel were not characteristic of my stay. Here is a list of things I felt took away from my New York vacation. Housekeeping: By far the worst housekeeping I've ever had in any hotel, ever! The rooms were clean enough--my person forgot to clean my restroom several times, but I can look past that. What I can't look past is having housekeeping staff outside my door every morning and every night loudly talking on their cell phones. My first morning, I was awoken by someone screaming ""SISTER, SISTER!"" Curious to what was going on, I peaked out my door only to discover a member of the housekeeping staff shouting on their phone. This happened on more than one occasion, with a different staff member each time. Other members of my party, who were staying in completely separate parts of the hotel also experienced this. This is an easy fix, and I hope this review changes that. Construction / Lack of Soundproofing: Be warned, the hotel is undergoing construction and is wrapped in scaffolding. The noise can be inconvenient to guests, especially considering that the windows of the hotel are nothing near soundproof. The walls are also paper thin, and I could often hear the conversations of my neighbors (and the hotel staff!) late into the night. Worst of all, the lack of soundproofing meant the rock band from the nearby club often made its way into my room--even at 1 am.Lack of Food: For a hotel that advertises itself as 4 Star, the universal expectation is that it has some sort of restaurant option for its guests, especially for breakfast; the Park Central, however, has none. Even Holiday Inns and other 3 star hotels have some sort of breakfast spread for their guests--it's not that hard! The only thing the Park Central has is its overly priced Central Market, where you can buy $12 mediocre grab-and-go sandwiches and $6 bottles of water. As a side note, a staff member informed me that I would be FINED if I brought in outside food to eat in their vast, empty seating area. Another staff member told me it was fine to being in outside food. Regardless of whoever was right, this is of evidence of a clear lack of communication between management and staff.The Elevators: This is the first time I've ever found fault with the elevators of a hotel. The Park Central's elevators are bizarre, inconvenient, and in need of repair. Namely, pressed-buttons don't light up, causing a sense of momentary anxiety as you wonder if your elevator will really stop at your floor. Additionally, the layout of the elevators is so confusing, that it really needs a map--somehow, the elevator directly outside my room took me the lobby of a different hotel? Most inconveniently, there is not nearly enough elevators for the size of the hotel. I would often wait 5 minutes for an elevator, only for it to be full. The moral of my stay: take the stairs! But this shouldn't have to be the case for handicapped people who don't have the option to take the stairs (or the time to wait 10 minutes for an elevator!) Overall, the Park Central Hotel has a great location and is affordable when compared to its competitors in the area. But considering that a night's sleep is nearly impossible, I wouldn't risk staying here.","Westlake Village, California","yelp_is_better</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westlake Village, California</strong>",59,1.0

It was clean, gorgeous and very impressive.

I also knew that because of the rate charged, that the hotel would more than likely be less than stellar. This was absolutely NOT the case. I felt safe the minute I walked into the hotel each night - there is security at the door of the hotel and they take the time to discreetly recognize you. The staff (in all areas of the hotel: front desk, bar and lounge area, convenience store downstairs, maintenance and all those on the phone that I didn't have the pleasure to meet) were pleasant, professional and genuinely happy. The room was modern, clean, quiet - just everything I needed. The first night I wanted an additional blanket (I'm always cold) and I called the service number to ask for a blanket. Immediately, not one - but two warm blankets were delivered. I then received a call from someone in maintenance confirming that my blankets arrived. What???? Who does THAT anymore?

First of all, this time the room had more synthetic pillows! Yay! I also felt that the elevator situation wasn't as bad as before, but maybe that's because I was on a top floor, so the elevator was always empty when it got to me. It appears they had just re-grouted the bathroom tile from the room I was staying in, because some of the stain from the black grout ran down the side of the shower when water was splashed on it. The bathroom door could use replacing for sure. In fact, in a small bathroom like that, it would be smart if the hotel went to using pocket doors! Now, in terms of complaints, I will say that the only reason I didn't rate this hotel higher has to do with their front desk. We encountered a few issues with our check in and reservation, and the attitude that the front desk took with me didn't help. They claimed that we didn't pay ahead of time for our group rooms, which we had proof of otherwise. On check out, we requested a late checkout for one member of our group who was sick, which they gave us, but again, there was definitely some attitude.

Its 10-15mins walk from Times Square and the shopping areas along Fifth Ave.The room was clean, and room/bathroom had reasonably modern décor and amenities, however there was a couple of things that dropped the experience a bit.First there was no luggage service that we were aware of – we hauled our luggage to our room ourselves and upon checking out brought the luggage down ourselves as well. There is a concierge so not sure if they offer this service or not.Second the lifts at this hotel area absysmally slow and inefficient. There’s no other way to put it. From what I understand, this is a large hotel (around 600-700 rooms) but there were only 2 lifts servicing the floors. Each day we’d have to pass up multiple lifts to get one that is suitably empty. (going down to lobby). This was only an issue in the mornings. In the evenings we got an empty lift first time each time, but they were still slow…Finally heating/cooling unit in the room was quite loud when it was on, it sounded like the motor was installed somewhere nearby which is what was audible rather than just loud passage of air.Other than that, this hotel wins on location and convenience and if you’re intending to be out and about the whole day and using the hotel just to sleep, it’s a suitable place to do just that.","Perth, Australia","Jeelan A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",29,4.0

You have to try their macaroons they are amazing.We honestly enjoyed our stay at Park Central, and the bed was extremely comfortable which was great after going sight seeing all day.

The ONLY good thing I can say about this hotel is the location.... and thats literally it. My mom and I just visited New York from Jan 4-8 as a celebratory trip, and this hotel ruined our experience. We had been in touch with the hotel prior to our arrival, and we were ensured that the staff would do everything in their power to ensure a special visit. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a rude woman who each time we saw her she would hide her name tag so we never got her name despite speaking with her on several occasions (was working Jan 4 at 230pm). She had an attitude each time we saw her and seemed as though she despised her job.Upon reaching our room, we were immediately disappointed. The room itself was tiny, despite upgrading to the King room (I forget the specific name of the room), but for some reason had a long, strange hallway. The hotel faces itself, so everytime we looked outside we could only see other people in their rooms, including a couple that made us very uncomfortable as they would be intimate by the window. This resulted in us having to keep the window shut. Additionally, the thermostat needed a new battery, so we had to call down because the room was way too hot. We had to wait a long time for someone to come upstairs to replace the battery, despite being told he would be up, ""immediately"". He ended up opening our window to which it became way too cold, but whenever we would shut the window it was way too hot. Additionally, the sounds of New York (i.e., sirens, music, honking, etc) would keep us up.Additionally, we had requested extra towels, a coffee machine and fridge upon avail... none of which was presented. Two days in a row (Jan 6 & 7), we were woken up at 6:00am on the dot by the alarm on the end table despite us never touching it. We suspect that when it was cleaned something was hit by mistake. Both days we were up late the night before, and after it went off we were unable to fall back asleep. Completely exhausted us. When room service came they did not replace the soap or hand towels. We asked for hand towels and were told, ""there were no more"" and that, ""once the next load of laundry was complete, we would receive them"" (we were on the 16th floor and this was at 9am....?). So, we went out for the day and returned in the early evening and still did not have towels or soap. The little cafe or whatever it's officially classified as in the hotel lobby is extremely overpriced, and the staff there are extremely rude as well. The woman working there (again, didn't catch her name but she works the morning shift and has should length strawberry blonde hair), just like the woman at the front desk, makes it extremely evident that she hates her job. She literally rolled her eyes at people and maintained an extremely rude attitude. There were two groups of children who were running around the lobby and each floor (they would take the elevator down one floor at a time) who were screaming and laughing late at night, holding up the elevators and waking people up. The lobby also had many people who were not staying at the hotel, some of which creeped my mom and I out. For a contrasting point of reference, I have stayed at the Sheraton one block down who always have staff and security members in the lobby. On multiple occasions I have walked past them politely, maturely, professionally and respectfully asking people to leave. It always made me feel much safer staying there. The bathrooms in the lobby are also always filled with people who are not staying at the hotel waiting to use the bathroom. I have never witnessed this being an issue at any other hotel in New York. For another point of reference, the Millennium at Times Square will not even let you approach the elevators unless you present your room key (or they recognize you). This hotel did not present adequate procedures as such. Anyone can walk in at any time in the lobby and hang out for as long as they wish. As if this wasn't enough, the elevators are also ridiculous. There are only two in the lobby, and the wait time for one to come would sometimes be up to 10 minutes long. They are also so tiny that once an elevator finally came, you couldn't squeeze in. Not only that, but the elevator would stop at every single floor despite there being no room for someone to fit on. So, you wait ten minutes for an elevator to come, and once it comes you most likely can't fit on. If you can, it takes another 5-10 minutes to finally reach the lobby because it stops at every single floor with disappointed people. Each time we were in the elevator (10+ times a day), people were ALWAYS complaining. I've never seen such tiny, poorly operated elevators in a hotel in my entire life.... and we were only on the 16th floor... I can only image how much more frustrating it was for people higher up.There are many more reasons, but this review is long enough. Do NOT stay at this hotel- you will just be frustrated and disappointed. There are countless hotel options in New York in every area, choose another.",,dnrnbr,1,1.0

So, we arrived at 2pm and waiting in a crazy line to check in. Only to be told to come back at 4 and leave our luggage. Well, the luggage like was also very long so my husband and I went to the bar. About an hour or so into our wait someone told us to give the front desk our phone number and they’ll call when our room is ready. I wish they had told us that when we first checked in, but I went back up and did it again. About 15 minutes later I noticed people getting keys and heading for the elevators. So I went back to the front desk just to check. Turns out our room was ready...but we did not get a call or text. We went to the room to drop our stuff and meet up with the family. The problem with the staff telling everyone to come back at 4 means there are now lines for the elevators...Other than that debacle the room was fine and clean just for one night. However, they do really nickel and dime you for the facilities fee. I purchased a groupon for the hotel stay. But then ended up having to pay $41 just for whatever a facilities fee is.

Second, the remote control in the room never worked so we were never able to change the channels in our bedroom and had to deal with not being able to watch the TV. Thrid, the hotel only had one working elevator at one point throughout my 6 day stay at the hotel which with the amount of guests at the hotel you can imagine how long the wait for an elevator during any time of the day would be. Coming down 8 flights of stairs with an injured knee is not the most ideal thing to do. Which at one point is exactly what I had to do after waiting 15 minutes for an elevator! Incredibly inconvenient. And lastly, I also had to deal with opening my own double doors in and out of the hotel because the handicaped automatic door button was not functioning.

My girlfriends and I decided we wanted to do a girls trip to NYC, and we decided to look at Groupon and found this hotel. Researching reviews, it seemed like an ok deal. We read the small print and knew about the $20/person fee above 2 people in a room and the $35/night amenities fee. We booked it. Getting to the hotel was easy. Location was great. Check in - awful. The man who helped us check in, couldn't be more awful. He was so rude and dismissive. We were there at 3:30. He said your room won't be ready until 4. He was still able to check us in, and took the credit card info. But once that was done, he just stopped talking to us. We observed others coming in and going to a desk to get door keys so we figured that is what we would need to do at 4pm.We opted to store our bags so we could get coffee after a day of traveling. This is an amenity that you pay $35/night plus tax for. A man standing at a different desk literally takes your bag and throws it into a room 2 steps behind a door. When we came back a little after 4 to get our room keys we picked up our bags. The attendant literally said ""I would like a tip"". I wasn't happy with that as $35/night is excessive and the only 'amenity ' we would even use would be the bag store service. Not the attendant's fault for the hotel policy. However, the attendant didn't do anything to get the tip. If I could get my own bag from behind the door, I would have. Its not like they put them on carts or carried them for us. Nothing to me that was 'tippable'. And I'm typically a generous tipper. Elevators always seemed congested. We often had to wait more than 5 minutes, mostly less than 10 minutes for an elevator. We were on the 10th floor. Our housekeeper/maid Mariska or Marisha was the nicest person we met from NYC. She was so welcoming and helpful, and so positively happy with each encounter. We left a tip the first day and requested some extra towels. She delivered wonderfully. Talking about tipping, I do feel bad we didn't leave a tip the 2nd night. Our Lyft came a lot quicker than expected - within a minute and we knew the elevator situation so we grabbed our bags and flew down 10 flights of stairs to catch the Lyft. In the shuffle we forgot to leave money for her.The restrooms on the ground floor are clean. The lobby shop has a good selection but closes early. It is a great location to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. Small rooms. I was in a room with 2 queen beds. Overlooked an alley. Could hear the garbage trucks, horns, etc all night. Even 10 floors up. If we were to go back, I think I would try to find a nicer hotel. Again, the housekeeper was great, and the nicest person.

Arriving to a less than warm greeting where we were told we had already checked in at 10:30am (we were at 41,000 feet and over the Atlantic at this time so check in would have been difficult) this confusion took 20 minutes to sort and was largely the colleague at the desk frowning at the screen in complete silence with a couple of “Card Please” and “Name Please” thrown in for good measure. The room itself was great, a nice big bed, really clean and a lovely view of the Xmas shop on the street below. A little bit noisy but you don’t book New York for a quiet getaway. The bar was also a great chill out spot for us too.Back to the staff at the hotel though.....I spoke to a guest relations about how I was planning to propose to my girlfriend and could she recommend any nice restaurants to celebrate. “No, you’ll have to speak to concierge was what I had as a reply and we actually counted in passing how many times this lady actually smiled when passing (It was zero) In comparison the concierge shook my hand, congratulated me and took the time to tell me about all of his favourite spots.We also went to ask about the hotel facilities but noticed the person at the counter was actually shopping for dresses on our way out of the bar which must have been why she didn’t make eye contact or acknowledge us to the point where we walked away.On checkout we had our bill posted under the door at 6am with some lovely additional charges from the person who had been checked in under our name in error. These were removed after we proved we weren’t even at the hotel at the time.So the common theme was the service here. The hotel is really nice and in a great location.

Our accommodations were very good and there is a great bar in the lobby; however, on our first night which was Thanksgiving night, they ran out of any kind of hors'douvres - no meat for the charcuterie tray and no olives for the cheese tray (the cheese that they did bring was a bit stale) but as we were quite a big group, it gave us a great place to meet and mingle. There is no restaurant in the hotel, just a place to get coffee, snacks and pastries.

Very convenient for what I was in NYC to do. Friendly, professional staff at registration desk and concierge was helpful. The hotel lobby area and bar are very nice. Conveniently located to Central Park, subway stops, about 10 block walk to Times Square. Nearby restaurants - Applejack Diner which is good for breakfast, and Serafina - good Italian, both about 2 blocks from hotel. (Hotel does not have a restaurant. There is a place to purchase coffee, muffins, pastry, fruit, small snack items, but we found it expensive. (2 medium lattes and 2 muffins were almost $20. You then can then take it to the bar area to eat.)Our initial room was a king room (1408) and the light in the bathroom mirror was so dim, you could really not see well. There was no chair in the room and it was tight between end of bed and dresser. We called for maintenance concerning the dim light, and they said this particular room had “different bulbs” in the bathroom mirror than most of the other rooms and nothing could be done. After speaking to guest relations, we were able to move to another room 3 doors down. This room was larger, had a chair, a well-lit bathroom BUT, was very hot and stuffy, even though we turned the temp down. Maintenance was called to this room and they explained due to age of building, they either had to have air conditioning or heat on, but could not switch back and forth; and since it was now winter, heat had been turned on, so only way to cool the room was to open a window. (A little noisy, but we did this to cool off the room.) Totally understand that this is because of age of the building, but just something to keep in mind. Room price changes for weekend and weekdays may be a little less. A facilities fee applies automatically. Hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, soap supplied.

Upon arrival, we were greeted promptly and friendly in a manner that made me feel less rushed (on a busy city street, yes!)and instantly relaxed. Doing anything with a three year old can be tough but there was nothing but smiles to be found. Making our way to the desk to check in, the decor is modern yet familiar with bright tones and clean lines, classically modern would be a decent term. The ladies at the desk were delightful, informative, and genuine as well as quick which was very much appreciated! Making our way up to the room, the halls seem a little narrow, but then you open the door to a large room which, compared to other places we have stayed, was a pleasant and welcome surprise! Comfortable and clean it lends to an air of quiet ambiance (of course if you listen closely you will remember what a busy area of a major city you are in)but that can'tbe helped. There are so many choices to get a bite to eat, and as for an adult beverage...I suggest the lounge! Perfectly mixed cocktails and a relaxed yet sophisticated feel! The next day sealed our Platinum stamp of approval. Check out was simple and easy, however, we needed to have our bags held for a couple of hours while we took an early afternoon stroll to the Central Park Zoo and surrounding park. Not only was it not an issue, Quimby Hightower made it a delight! He gave us his card for our bags stating that it isn't an issue at all and when we returned had a Park Central Hotel tote full of goodies for the ride home and a balloon, and presented it to our little guy for his birthday! Those little things, attention to detail, genuine kindness, personable while remaining professional...they add up to create unforgettable experiences and a top choice when returning to the area!

Moreover, throughout my entire stay at this terrific hotel, I was always in such a very good mood and I attribute this at least in part to a most welcoming hotel staff. Obviously, this hotel is located in one of the best New York City zip codes, which undeniably is the main attraction for booking a reservation. However, there are other good reasons as well to stay at the “Park Central Hotel”, which include: the hotel is extremely well run, immaculately clean and the daily room rates generally do not fluctuate much in comparison to other NYC hotels’ daily room charges. Although this hotel is very busy with over 900 guest hotel rooms, not once did I ever encounter a problem with hotel management when requesting to extend my stay and I did this at least several times while I was a guest. The hotel lobby is quite grand and has a lounge area that includes a huge bar with lots of banquet seating and where seasoned bartenders make excellent mixed drinks. However, there is no restaurant at this hotel but it is easy to order in food from several nearby restaurants. Also in the hotel lobby is an excellent coffee/pastry shop with very fresh daily selections. The coffees offered are all excellent and Gina who works there has to be one of the nicest people you will ever encounter. In addition to this, the hotel reception staff all are completely organized and sincerely friendly. I did want to specifically mention Angela as she made certain that my check in went smoothly and that any special requests I had were met. She was as perfectly pleasing as possible and this is an employee who obviously excels at customer service. In summation: The Park Central Hotel is an excellent yet less expensive hotel in comparison to other nearby hotels that are all in a prime NYC location and is an ideal choice to stay at. Many of the guests staying there that I spoke with indicated to me that they felt the same sentiments as I did and absolutely enjoyed the overall experience of being a patron at a hotel that knows exactly how to treat all their guests in a most special way. I highly recommend this hotel inasmuch as staying there made me feel as if I had escaped the busy outside city life in exchange for the serenity that awaited me inside at the very special “Park Central Hotel”!

It’s a nice hotel – with a strange setup. There’s no restaurant and consequently no room service either. This I have no problem with – generally speaking Id rather go out anyway and for some reason or another, hotel breakfasts in the USA are notoriously bad. Never quite figured out why – but rarely is it worth the money or the bother. The room we had was large with two double beds – in New York hotels rooms are not large in general. This was perfect. Either you could face inwards – with 5 meters to the next building/window – or outwards towards Carnegie hall, with the noise from the street as an added bonus. Again – this is New York, so it should come to no surprise to anyone. Only two elevators served our floor – and since the hotel was pretty full – at times you could expect to queue up for elevators. All in all I liked the hotel – there’s always a but, there were a few things I did not like. Some of the staff was great – in particular the concierge, the doorman getting taxis was absolutely great (didn’t catch his name) and the assistant manager who assisted me when we had a check out problem with the credit card charges. But the check-in and check-out staff were at best not interested, at worst rude. And not New York arrogant – I mean rude. Strange that the front desk from left to right can be so different. Our wedding anniversary was during our visit, so I picked up flowers – but the hotel could not offer up a vase – not in any shape or form. For what is supposedly a first class hotel - that’s a first for me. And the final part that I did not appreciate – although I liked the room size – it was far from clean. Im not particularly sensitive, but when I see the sense in going to buy a box of Clorox to wipe down the surfaces you get the picture. Picked up old bottle tops from the floor underneath the desk, etc. You get the picture – it just generally did not feel clean and wasn’t either from the look of the used Clorox wipes. That is certainly not acceptable. Will we be back – perhaps. At the right price … sure. At the price we paid this time around, no.","Hollviken, Sweden","HansR66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hollviken, Sweden</strong>",68,3.0

We stayed Nov 5-10 and the hotel was super nice, clean and well maintained. Yes there is no coffee maker, microwave or fridge but I think u can get that if requested but why would you want to since everything is so close to the hotel you can get coffee downstairs, across the street, next door or two doors down (Starbucks). And yes there is no restaurant but once again, so many great choices so close to you. Go out and explore. The hotels location is perfect, far enough out of Times Square to get away from the crowd but close enough you can be there in a few mins. Central Park, broadway and 5th ave are only a few mins away, and also subway stations super close (and super easy to use). The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are much more spacious than lots of other hotels we looked at that were more expensive than the Park Central. Even though a lot of reviews say upgrade to get a room on a higher level to get a quieter room and a view, you don’t need to, my husband and I booked the classic king room and we ended up on the 6th floor and it was perfect, you could hear a bit of noise outside but we had the fan on our heating/cooling system on and it was perfect. My parents booked a classic king room as well and ended up on the 5th floor and they had no complaints either. And if you book higher for a view I don’t think you would get much a view cause you are surrounded by taller buildings. Don’t trust a lot of those negative reviews, I am a very picky person when it comes to where I stay and this hotel met my high standards. We all loved the hotel and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to the city.

Housekeeping did a good job, they cleaned daily. However upon arrival when inspecting the bathroom there is some sort of something on the walls that doesn’t look like there has ever been any attempt to clean it off. We stayed for 8 nights, on night 2 we reported that our room phone wasn’t working and nothing was done about it. On day 3 we reported the phone again and nothing was done about it. The night before the Marathon my husband tried to call reception to request a wake up call and AGAIN the phone still wasn’t working. Numerous times we had to go looking for housekeeping to advise them they could make up our room because the phone wasn’t working and we couldn’t call them.Finally my husband for a 4th time went and requested for someone to fix the phone and it was suggested by the guest relations staff that we didn’t know how to use a phone and that it wasn’t broken and it was user error. This time they sent a lovely gentleman to come to the room to look at the phone, he was lovely, we’ll mannered and took a lot of pride in his work. This man is the kind of person they are luck to have working for them. He ascertain that the phone was unplugged at the back and that the handset needed a new battery. He fixed it quickly and but it would have been nice if it was fixed when it was first reported, it was a big inconvenience in our stay.Would I stay here again, no and my suggestion to others is factor in the “facility fees” to your budget as the faculty fee plus costs to stay at this hotel you might be able to find somewhere that doesn’t have the fee for the same price.Please note that all issues were raised with Guest Relations who committed to responding however at the time of writing this review upon checking out no response has been provided.

We arrived super early Saturday and didn't expect our room to be ready that early. We checked in and stored our baggage with the bellman. That process was the worst thing during our stay. We were in line for at least 15 min while the bellman went into the back room to track down a package for someone in front of us. Frustrating. Our room was good. We had a premier double queen room on the 14th floor. We overlooked the backside of the hotel, which was actually great because I think it was quieter. The room was clean and decent size. We had 3 suitcases and no issue storing things in drawers or even just in suitcases on the floor/bench. Decent closet space and there is a safe for securing valuables. One issue was AC. It was really hot in our room. We took to opening the window while we were out so it would cool down and we set the thermostat really low. It wasn't a huge deal because it's November, but I can imagine that being an issue in hotter months. Excellent location! We were a couple blocks from Central Park and about a 10 min walk to Times Square. I was not pleased about the $35 ""resort fee"", but it's not uncommon among the NYC hotels.

The class took place in the hotel bar and was hosted by their mixologist Jason, who was very professional and personable. We learned to make three delicious whiskey cocktails. I usually prefer gin or vodka cocktails, but the drinks definitely wowed me - our group agreed that the sage blood-orange one was hands down the best one. As someone who's never tried making cocktails beyond simple mixers, it was really satisfying making drinks that tasted like something I'd pay $20 for at a bar. More than that, it was such a fun way to spend an afternoon with friends (even our NYC native friend was impressed). We were shocked that the class was only $45, considering all the drinks and the charcuterie plates they brought out for us as well. A class like this could easily go for $100+ in LA.

The lift access is dreadfully slow and insufficient in comparison to room and guest members.My big issue with the hotel is that despite them issuing a final invoice for the agreed value for my stay I'm still yet to receive a refund of my $200 deposit for incidentals. Be very aware of this. it's not particularly clear at booking that this is required, but you get stumped for it when you check in. also consider that this may be a reasonably sized chunk of your spend budget if you go with X amount of USD to spend. also if you're visiting from outside the US be aware that they advise in their small print it can take up to 30 days to get this back. this in my view is complete rubbish as after speaking with both my card provider and MasterCard they suggest a refund should be much quicker. I've written several times, and have just been fobbed of with '30 days'. I'm now at 27 days and nothing, and I hold no hope for it turning up, so the inconvenience of having to persue a chargeback seems likely. all in all not fussed on this place and feel we could have done better for the money. can't recommend.","Trowbridge, United Kingdom","tim10500</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trowbridge, United Kingdom</strong>",5,2.0

Special note has to go to Quimby Hightower, who literally made every request a reality and went above and beyond to make sure our stay, and that of our guests for whom this was their first visit to the Big Apple, was a perfect one. I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly.","New York City, New York","Orphanedstarfish2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,5.0

We had to change rooms once due to ueber noisy neighbors, the new room was 2 floors down and 2 floors louder, although we requested accomodations NOT facing the front, that's where we were put under the headline of an 'upgrade'. In the new room, the safe deposit box did not work, the bathroom drain only worked without the stopper, the first day we did not get any towels at all and although I called housekeeping they never were delivered. On the 3rd day we got no room service at all. By then we were so frustrated, could not wait to leave the next morning. The music in the lobby is so loud that conversations are prohibitive, there is a huge construction site out on 7th Ave, where our window was facing, nobody with a conscience should have put guests there who explicidly requested a quiet room. All this we brought to the attention of the concierge upon check-out, but were made to feel we were hustling for a discount.

The only low point would be the elevators were slow. While there is no parking connected to the hotel there are a lot of parking garages half a block around the corner. I used a Groupon and the rate was excellent. Be aware however the hotel does have a $35 “resort” fee. However even with everything my room a king was under $200. For NYC that was a real bargain.

I visited the hotel website & struggled to find any mention of this charge, but eventually found the information in the FAQ section, which reads: 'WHAT IS THE FACILITIES FEE?The mandatory Facilities Fee of $35 plus tax per room per night provides guests with the following amenities: - Unlimited Local and Domestic Long Distance Calls - Unlimited use of the 24-hour state-of-the-art Fitness Center - Luggage storage on arrival and/or departure up until 9:00 PM - Apple workstations with printing, faxing and scanning offered through our Guest Relations Team - 10% off your experience at our lobby bar Park Lounge - 1 hour free bike rental with 1 hour purchase from our partner Fancy Apple, showing your room key.**Please note, the facilities fee is not inclusive of service gratuities.'So there you go, We are now preparing to pay an additional sum of $140 (plus tax) at the end of our stay for facilities which we will not be using (apart from possibly having to store our luggage before our departure - $140 (plus tax) for that seems a bit steep!) Quite why establishments insist on doing this is beyond me, as there is clear evidence from previous reviews that all it does is create 'a bad taste' and deter guests from making a return visit. If you must charge people for facilities they don't use, then bury it in the room rate - ignorance is bliss, as they say. Better still, charge guests for what they use, when they use it.Anyway, let's see how the visit goes in December & I'll return with an update on our stay. Perhaps the hotel will redeem itself - it will have to do well to convince me that I haven't been ripped off.","Sunderland, United Kingdom","2018FTM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunderland, United Kingdom</strong>",2,3.0

If you’re not familiar with NYC, it’s a fabulous location - easy walk to Broadway, Central Park, west side, east side, etc. the lobby is lovely - bright and inviting. Contrary to a few negative reviews, I found all of the staff helpful and friendly. I had booked in advance for the rate that included the possibility of cancelling. 3 days before, when I knew I wouldn’t need to cancel, I changed to a non-refundable rate for a significant savings and got a larger room. In fact, a nice sized room for NY, street view and higher level. Street noise and hallway noise were all acceptable.Now the negative and why I won’t return. As stated on other reviews, the room doesn’t feel clean. While the bed was clean and comfortable, the room felt musty and the bathroom had an odor. At first I thought maybe it was the plumbing, but I think it might have been dirty rags. Management needs to have the carpets cleaned well. There is what looks like dust on the floor by all of the walls. Also, it is strange that there is only one heavy, opaque window shade. With office buildings directly across the street, that means that the shade must be kept completely closed for privacy if you’re light is on Most hotels have an additional curtain or shade that allows light to come in, but can be closed so people can’t look in.It was also surprising that the lovely, large bar off of the lobby doesn’t serve any food at all. However, there is a small take out cafe, but closes early.The elevator security is misleading. As long as one person uses a key to make the elevator work, you can go to any floor. At most hotels with an elevator key slot, a key is needed to get to each specific floor.Location - perfectStaff - responsive Noise level - good for NYRoom size - good for NYRoom cleanliness - needs improvement ",St louis MO,"Groupworker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St louis MO</strong>",62,3.0

We came here last month and it still sticks out as a sore thumb in my memory. It is a lie to call this a 4 star hotel.Issue 1: Facilities FeeThis ridiculous policy they have of $35 plus tax PER DAY ""facilities fee"" which covers the gym and concierge and newspapers - all the things that should come as part of a decent hotel anyway without extra charges. I don't understand why it's not already part of the room rate. We definitely didn't know about this prior to checking in. Is it so they can keep a lower rate on search engines and then spring the fee on unsuspecting guests? We took up issue with this and spoke to the manager, who was very rude and said that it's a standard practice in all New York hotels. Having stayed in New York hotels many times before, we knew this was a complete lie. Her rudeness and dishonesty, coupled with this unreasonable policy, were an awful way to start our stay.Issue 2: HousekeepingThe housekeeping is abysmal. Every single day we had a different standard of housekeeping. Once our towels were taken and not replaced. I had to call and ask for new towels. Another time, the housekeeper knocked the door and actually asked me to bring our garbage to the door for her. What kind of housekeeping standard is this? Ridiculous.Also they do not have any slippers and bathrobes at all. I have never been even in a 3 star hotel that refuses to provide these basic comfort items for guests.Issue 3: FacilitiesThis is an old hotel and even though attempts have been made to modernise it, you can still see the upkeep is poor. The window shades in our room were blackened and tattered on one side. There are stains all over the walls, especially in the bathroom. The hallway carpeting looks old and tired and there are even glasses left all over the floor by housekeeping I presume. It is not a pretty sight. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything your neighbours are saying and doing. The elevators take forever, be prepared to spend 10 minutes waiting each time you need to go up or down. There are also no mini fridges or coffee machines in the rooms. What are the facilities fees paying for if these guests still have all these inconveniences?Issue 4: Staff AttitudeAs mentioned above, the manager's response to us was unacceptably unprofessional and housekeeping is pretty bad too (see the staff asking me to carry garbage to her for her own convenience). We also needed to pick up a package and we were told that we could pick up from the concierge 24/7. So we got back around 11pm and asked for our package and then we were told the package room had already closed and we had to wait til the next day. Why were we being told different things by different staff?The only thing I liked about this hotel was the seating in the lobby. It's a nice place to sit and have breakfast or meet with people. However this one aspect is not enough to redeem all of the others that went wrong.The location is also rather undesirable, it's located in what feels like tourist central with food carts immediately outside the door and homeless people on the corners. Some might like this environment because it's close to other tourist hotspots but I did not.In conclusion, do not waste your money on this hotel. There are much better experiences to be had at many other NYC hotels and there's no reason why guests should put up with all of the issues I listed above.",,KatieMG55,4,1.0

To be more specific: common four letters starting the last name. How about having someone who might actually pick up the phone, instead of minutes of numbers to push to try to do do it yourself?3.

It's nice. It's clean. It's actually quiet - at least on the 11th floor. It's as tourist central as it gets. A place to lay your head and then get out and go. Next to zero amenities for most. Example, no coffee in rooms (must request a pot), no 'real' housekeeping, no room service, no food, and for me, no real concierge service. My room had a faulty bathtub and a missing closet door (I would've never noticed the door - but the maintenance folks noticed when they fixed the bath - no complaints there. Tom was great).None of this is a deal breaker, but when my rate to stay longer due to an extension of meetings went from 400 per night to 1,000 per night, I skipped on out to a new location. It was mainly just odd. Never saw a bellman - just a doorman to hail a cab, never had a cleaned room - meaning, they make the bed and empty trash. NOTHING ELSE. Not a wipe down, not a straighten up, nothing. I never even had food I'd had delivered (no food in the hotel) removed. It was always just left on the desk (no trashcans big enough to place containers in)... I'm no slob, but I think stacked disposable dishware and empty water bottles/juice/ in room glasses would be an obvious thing to remove? Maybe not. I asked the concierge about recommendations to book me for a massage. He informed me he could 'google some places in the area"" - no thanks, I have the googles on my own phone. They do allow delivery of food. You can go down to the lobby to meet the delivery driver. I had no use for 10% off of a hotel bar (it's like the heart of the city right here), and I had no need for a gym, There's no pool or 'amenities' other than a 'business center' - but that 40.00 'resort fee' they charged was still front and center. Trust me, if you can buy in the same price range elsewhere, I would. You are only paying for location, not another thing. And 400 plus a night is a LOT for a bed. It's a 3 star hotel - but pretty - hence the rating. I requested a room with a view - and I got it - as I was told - of the building across the street. Fun watching people work! The photos show rooms with views - but I don't know that is the truth... I prob won't be back, but I guess my expectations of paying premium for premium services are too high. Pretty disappointing, but nothing to remove stars about. Simply having a few things that make visitors stay a bit pleasant and not 'work' to do anything hotel related would change it up a lot!","Little Rock, Arkansas, United States","JJC99999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Little Rock, Arkansas, United States</strong>",26,3.0

The difference between Park Central and the rest is that the other hotels lack energy and exciting vibe. Quimby embodies that infectious personality and a “let’s make it happen” type of leadership!

I found a pretty decent deal through expedia.ca and booked with Park Central based on the location and pretty good reviews regarding their customer service. It was just okay overall. The room was cleaned daily and replenished with fresh towels, which was nice but I wouldnt say they were deep cleaned, even upon arrival. Dust in the corners, left over hair in the shower, etc. The cards for the rooms are frustrating and do not often work properly...I had made it clear we were celebrating our recent wedding and were told we would be ""taken care of"" in terms of a nice room but that didnt happen...we ended up with a room with two double beds :S so confusing. Nothing else was done, not even a congratulations at check in.They also have a VERY steep daily fee, so expect a large bill at the end of your stay. I had been aware of this but for the dated nature of the hotel, the issues with the room keys, etc. 10% off at the hotel bar isn't exactly worth it. They charge resort fees in vegas but that is because they all have pools, etc. That being said the location is excellent, a few blocks from Central Park and Times Square. Would I recommend it? maybe, for location if you get a good deal.Would I book again? probably not, would rather pay a bit more for an initial cost at a more modern place with no hidden fees.",,LeahM1559,4,3.0

Yes, it did face an interior courtyard area and all I saw was a brick wall in the distance but hey, it was only for one night. It was blissfully quiet which is always a plus in NYC. The room was modern and clean and the bed was incredibly comfy. Large TV, enough conveniently placed plugs for charging and well lit. Was it worth that large sum of money? Not sure but I think I caught NYC on a particularly bad Wednesday night so I was grateful to get a room. It is convenient if you want to hang in that part of town and there was a Starbucks just steps from the front door. Yay. Would I consider it again? You bet.","Wilton, Connecticut","Ctmom90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wilton, Connecticut</strong>",103,5.0

Certainly not what we expected for the price we paid. I immediately called reception & asked if we could move to a room without an interconnecting door, I was told the concierge would come up & take us to another room.We sat there for 45 minutes & no one came so I called again, this time they said that they would get the manger to call me ""right back"" Meanwhile our friends were waiting downstairs so we could go out as we'd had nothing to eat since we'd landed. Another 20 minutes go by so I called again, this time I was eventually put through to the 'manager' I explained that this was the third call to reception with regards the room & she said she knew nothing about it ? I tried to explain the issues but she butted in to say there was nothing she could do as they had no other rooms available. When I asked why I had been told on the first call that the concierge would come up to move us she said they couldn't have done that as they were finished for the night ! She said the best she could do was move us to a 'deluxe' room the following day so we couldn't unpack & eventually left to find a restaurant 1 1/2 hours later than we could have done had we been told this in the first place.We did get moved the folllowing day & this room (652) was far better but not really what I expected for the price. Oh & the toilet seat was cracked in this room & the heaters in all 3 rooms did not seem to work. We then found on the second night the bar closed at 11.30pm, the 4th night it was closed completely for a private function & the day we left it was not open while we waited for our airport transfer ( between 1pm & 3pm) There is a little shop that sells very limited food, drink & coffee but that's it. No idea how they get 4 stars. No kettles in the rooms, no fridge ( unless you ask for one ) not even a bottle of water. As other guests have said the facilities fee of $35 / night is ridiculous & should be included in the price as it is compulsory. We had no use for anything it offered ( apart from luggage storage which most hotels offer for free ) & it didn't even include the wifi ? To recap, we found the staff on reception unfriendly & unhelpful, rooms with interconnecting doors could be very noisy, poor facilities for the price, a bar that's not open very late or not at all, standard room very poor, deluxe room just ok, nothing special or deluxe about it.The location was the only thing really going for it, 3 blocks from Central Park & 10 mins walk to Times Square. Would I stay again, no. Would I recommend it, not really, I've stayed in much nicer places for a lot less money.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","philip b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",10,2.0

The only gripes I have are minor but big enough for me to still remember. The hotel really does require more lifts to service floor 0 - 9. this was especially a problem on the morning of departure with bags to carry and the lifts absolutely full to bursting upon landing on our floor for a good 20 minutes. The TV channel choice in the room is limited, our hotel in Boston had Netflix facility so we could sign-in and let our daughter watch while we got ready for the day ahead and finally our room looked out onto 7th Avenue but we were only just above the level of the hotel foyer and to say the flat room we looked out onto looked like a post apocalyptic waste land would be no exaggeration.

Only downsides were that there was no basic coffee of tea facilities in the room so there’s no morning tea in bed option (no doubt to encourage you to go downstairs and buy a coffee).

On November 4th, 1928, Arnold Rothstein walked into the Park Central’s front door and few hours later he spilled out of the service entrance with a bullet in his gut. 29 years later, the Park Central would see blood again, but this time in its barbershop. October 25, 1957, Albert Anastasia strutted into Grasso’s Barber shop in The Park Central Hotel. The mobster took a barber chair with his back facing the door. The attack was a classic mob hit. Two identically dressed gunmen hidden beneath aviator sunglasses, fedoras, and scarves wrapped around their faces walked into the hotel lobby. A wheelman and lookout in the lobby were waiting for them outside. Five bullets tore into the mafia chieftain. The police never apprehended the mob hitmen and the crime remains unsolved. The barbershop is now, like everything else, a StarBucks.The rooms are nice. The old bathroom means the door doesn't open all the way, instead hits the toilet before even halfway open. The seat has a big crack in it after everybody hits it with the door over and over. Every day when I returned to the room at 4:30, the maid had not cleaned yet. Rather than have to leave for an hour while she cleaned, I called the front desk and told them no need for towels and making the bed, etc. This continued 3 days in a row. Then I got a message that I must allow cleaning or the management will be forced to open the door to inspect. I guess I understand, after all. the Vegas bomber refused service for days, but it was the late cleaning every day that upset me. All in all, the location can't be better for everything Manhattan, and I would definitely return, and I plan to. Check prices carefully, as the daily charge fluctuates wildly from day to day.","Austin, Texas","music-professor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",56,5.0

The bathroom is very small. Single shower. If you’re not planning to be in your room much and just need a comfy bed to sleep after a long day then this is a good choice.

My upgraded Superior King was way too small for two. If your luggage is larger than carry-ons, you won't find a convenient place to set and open. My room was very dark. They have an issue with proper lighting. The closet has no lighting. There are no clothes hooks to hang anything on - only the closet hangars, which are useless if you are trying to match a tie with a jacket or shirt, or just simply hang a robe. Small inconveniences like these are reason enough to go for a better place. The entrance door are is dark. So dark I couldn't see the umbrella I left near the door. With luggage opened, there wasn't enough room to walk around the bed, which by the way, wasn't great, either. No pillow choices, just huge way-too-soft worn out feather pillows. The desk lamp was absolutely disgusting, as it had not been cleaned since the day it was put on the tiny (TINY) desk area. No restaurant (or room service) at this hotel. Only two SMALL elevators out of four working. And each stops at every floor. If you're on a high floor, forget getting on - six or seven adults will fill it up. A completely unmovable 4pm check-in time. And a luggage line of at least a dozen guests pretty much all the time. One attendant.

The hotel is surrounded by places to eat/bars/shops. It is right in the heart of New York. You can see Times Square when you step out the door and Central Park is a 5 minute walk in the other direction. On arrival, our bags were taken to the room by staff and they told us if we needed anything, to call to reception. I found that this was very slow and we ended up spending the first night without a cot for our baby, even though I had sent an email in advance to confirm that this would be in the room, as were arriving late. Our room didn’t have enough towels for the family and we had to call to reception again! The beds were comfortable but the duvets had no covers and were instead put between two sheets. The room was extremely muggy and unpleasant, as the air conditioning was incredibly weak and made a loud noise when turned on. The bathroom has absolutely no ventilation so the mirror gets all steamed up and this contributes the humidity in the room.In general, the hotel is perfectly located but the hotel itself could be better!

Amazingly, the Westhouse exceeded my already high expectations. Upon being dropped off at the main entrance, my wife and I were promptly greeted by a team of doormen. What I immediately noticed, and then what I discovered to be a theme throughout our stay, was how genuinely friendly the staff is. Not the ""I'm friendly because it's my job"" friendly, but the ""genuinely happy to see you"" friendly. Doormen, front desk, housekeeping, terrace staff: every single person we encountered was super friendly and accommodating. The hotel manager, Petr, checked in with us throughout . After learning our tastes and preferences, Petr made spot-on restaurant recommendations. Not the touristy ones the everyone already knows about, but the small hidden gem restaurants that could otherwise go unnoticed except for a dedicated local following. Clearly, Petr genuinely listened to us. One of the many amenities that comes with staying at the Westhouse is the morning breakfast and the late afternoon ""hours of indulgence"". Going in, I thought wrongly - oh so very wrongly- that this would be a generic continental breakfast and a little meat and cheese spread in the afternoon. The breakfast always had freshly made eggs, meat and lots of other goodies. The coup de grace was the afternoon hours of indulgence. In addition to a wide selection of cheese, Italian meats and very delicious wines was a daily, freshly made hot item worthy of New York's best restaurants. Once, manicotti was offered, and on another day, the best seafood paella that I ever had the privilege to savor. I have been to NYC dozens of times in my life. I have stayed at quite a few very fine hotels. Without a doubt, my most enjoyable and most memorable visit was our stay at the Westhouse.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with exceptional hospitality and asked if we needed any recommendations on places to eat/things to do, and given a city map. Once we went up to our room, we noticed a smell (like a musty/wet mop smell). It was quite strong, but we figured that room was just cleaned and that the smell would go away. Approximately 10mins after checking in, someone knocked on the door to inspect the room and make sure we were happy with it. We noted the smell and she figured out that it was the shower curtain and said they would replace that ASAP for us. We left for the afternoon and when we got back the smell was completely gone and the curtain had been changed (we were more than impressed with this service). Despite some comments, I did not find the room AS small as most people stated. The A/C worked amazing, the beds/pillows were extremely comfortable, and to top it off, free wifi was given (which appears quite hard to find in NY).

It is my hotel of choice in New York City. This is why:Manhattan boasts hundreds of hotels to choose from with all the amenities you could imagine, but what makes a hotel REALLY special? THE PEOPLE! That is what the Park Central on 7th Avenue has. I could tell you about the great location right between Central Park and Times Square or the actual human size rooms (which anyone who has stayed in a New York hotel can appreciate) that are clean and stylish, but what truly sets it apart is the staff. Carolyn and Manny are at the front desk offering top notch check-in service and a friendly word when you come in from dinner or the theater. Gina is in the café ready with a cup of coffee or a pastry. Even the facilities staff are friendly and helpful at every turn. At the Park Central, the people make the place!

Awesome inexpensive food and if you order on grubhub they will bring it to your lobby. Cons: They are doing construction at Carnegie Hall and we were on the 4th floor. It was kind of loud during the day with jack hammers. We only really noticed it on check out day because we were out of the room most of the time. Room size is small. Bathroom is small.

Checked in on 7/13 and then on 7/15, I realized that two pair of very expensive glasses were missing from our room. One pair of Ray Ban sunglasses and one pair of prescription Tom Ford glasses that were tucked away in our suitcase were missing when we went to pack our stuff. We searched the room up and down, all over the place and nothing was found. These glasses were both tucked away in bags and did not leave the room. Saturday morning before leaving, we locked our valuables in the safe and left the glasses tucked away in our bag and suitcase. On Sunday, we filed a report with security, who was completely unaware of protocol and the appropriate procedures in this situation. He advised us to ask Customer Service about the next steps (because he was unaware of them himself). When we checked out, we stopped at Customer Service before leaving and they were of no help either. Quite frankly, they were condescending and patronizing towards us saying that they would ""check the footage on security cameras"" and the ""card access history."" Then when I asked up front what would happen next, they said their ""head of security"" would not be working until the next day, leaving us with no further information. Out of all the hotels I have stayed in, I have never thought twice about having my glasses STOLEN. In addition to this very disappointing event, every time we would come back to the room in the evening, the entire third floor reeked of marijuana both nights. My only hope is that there is some sort of resolution/recovery when/if I hear back from the security director. We will NOT be coming back to this hotel.

My lady friend and I went here in April of this year as we were looking for a nice hotel that was close to the Metropolitan Opera House and other major attractions and this perfectly met our expectations. From this hotel, Central Park is about a 10-minute walk, Times Square about 15-20 minutes, the Lincoln Center, a 5-minute taxi ride. There is also an entrance to the subway conveniently located outside the hotel for those of you who would like to use public transit to explore other parts of the city like Brooklyn or Lower Manhattan. Customer service at this hotel was friendly. When making inquiries about buying tickets to the MET Museum and Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises, the staff were always willing to answer our questions and help us out. They also have a printing station conveniently located in the lobby that is free of charge if you need to print any personal stuff. The man who served us our drinks at the lounge area also made us feel very welcome there. On our last day, they also had a desk where we dropped off our luggage for safe-keeping, since check-out was in the morning and our flight home was not until the evening, so that we were able to continue with some last-minute adventures in the city.Our room was clean and had a nice view of the city from our window. I loved the wall divider that separated both of our beds, which gave each of us that extra privacy. Wifi signal was fast and easy to set-up as well. The furniture, decor, and the hallways also had a nice New Yorker vibe to it. We paid a lot of money for this hotel but it was well worth it.

My phone rang and a condescending voice asked me to come back down to the lobby to run my credit card on the room. I explained I was in my pajamas after an 18 hour day at which time he got more combative trying to explain to me that he was doing me a favor. I’m not sure what the flavor was. I asked him for his name and your name, at which time he told me you’d be available on Friday.On Friday when I came down to speak to the general manager, he was on the phone. Our paths never crossed because of the extensive amount of conferences we had to attend while in NYC.Each year I bring students to New York for the Columbia Scholastic Press Association National Conference. I have always stayed at the Park Central. I have also referred other faculty members that attend this conference to stay at this location. After this terrible treatment I will never stay at the Park Central again. Nahn’s lack of customer service and arrogance did not exclude the luxury brand he tried to proclaim about the Park Central. I’ve stayed at many hotels and been treated much kinder. In this industry, customer service is key. Nahn clearly are not ready for the position he has. Perhaps they should attend sensitivity training where they learns the value of customer service. As an educator I too am in the people business. I understand that kindness is a choice, it is one I choose to take. Perhaps the Park Central would be better served with someone that treats others the way they wants to be treated.","Las Vegas, Nevada","245debrak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",18,1.0

We got there about noon and we were able to go directly into out room. My son and family hadn't arrived and I requested a crib, a refridgerator and a coffee maker for them. They all arrived within 30 minutes. Impressive! The rooms each had 2 double beds and we were on the 4th floor, so we weren't high payers. We got a great package that included parking, which was important for my son. The rooms were really nice, with great bathrooms. Nothing was peeling, or broken. The beds were SO comfortable. The pillows were great! The housekeeps were some of the best we have ever met. If you stay on the 4th floor, you will have a housekeeper named Bebe, who will take care of you. She is the kindest soul there is....and so all of the housekeepers are kind because she guides them. I cannot say enough about the kindness about everyone in the hotel. There might be lines at the elevator, but they move quickly and the lines aren't all the time. Don't let it bother you. There are all sorts of restaurats within a block or 2 of the hotel.

Went to the lobby and asked to have the key that I had at the time to have it reset or issue a new one. The person behind the desk asked for an ID which I did not have at the time and was refused service because of hotel policy. I was not offered any alternative solutions nor asked for additional information. I felt very dismissed and the experience left a sour note. So I had to wait until for the other half to return to have access to the room.2 - the room smelled musty so I had to opened up all the windows to let some fresh air in. The room my in-laws were in had the same must odor. They had to request for a new shower curtain because the smell was soo bad.3 - the windows of this hotel are not sound proof meaning get ready for some restless nights. Sound from the street carries and you can hear it from you room. If you plan on a quiet night and this hotel, don't count on it.4 - the hotel does not come with its own refrigerator. So if you need one, you have to ask for it and count on a couple of hours or more to have it delivered to your room.5 - walls not insulated. You can hear people from the other room very clearly.As I mentioned, the location of this hotel is ideal. It is within walking distance from Central Park and Times Square.

The real problem came at checkout, when the front desk person then asked to put a 35/night “resort fee” on the same card where my $150 deposit hold lay. I had never been informed of this (granted I didn’t book it). The fee is supposedly justified by several amenities, such as fitness center access, but this is something I did not use, (and something most hotels don’t charge for). The place is not a “Resort” by any means, it’s a normal hotel. The combination of the deposit hold and resort fee, Felt like I was getting a little swindled.

The hotel reception staff struggled to make eye contact and if you asked a question you were greeted with a bit of a grunt or simply pointed in a direction. Way off the mark of what you should expect of an American 4 star.

Spacious room - at least mine was - with 2 double beds, decent bathroom with tub/shower combo, desk, dresser, plenty of closet space. Also toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, gel, soap and lotion all very decent.) They have a blow dryer and iron - and that's good. Plenty of hangers too. And that's where the 'what's good' ends.Improvements needed: Clean up the rooms - shades soiled, carpeting dirty, walls dirty. Bath towels thin and way too small. HORRIBLE LIGHTING! For women this no-decent lighting in the bathroom pretty much means you can't see jack-all when trying to put on makeup, etc. - so you leave the hotel kinda scary looking! THEY HAVE NO RESTAURANT ON PREMISE! AGH! You cannot access any food or drink 24 hours there - not at all. They have a little market in the building that is open some hours - but NOT 24/7. NO room service. So at normal NYC time - you've got no access to anything in hotel so must leave premises to get food/drink that you want to have back in your room. Concierge NOT friendly or helpful - and the right hand mos def does NOT know what the left hand is doing. Everyone gives constantly conflicting info! First they told me that the restaurant next door, the Redeye Grill, was closed. Then they said no it's open. Then they said no it's closed. But wait there's more! Then...they told me I did NOT have to come and re-key for my 3rd/additional night in hotel. Then they told me I did need to come re-key for my 3rd night. Then they said I didn't need to. Then they said I did. My gawd - no one knows what's going on. The have no umbrellas to lend/charge to your room if needed. NO bathrobes in room. AND EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE DO NOT DISTURB ON YOUR DOOR - MAIDS KNOCK AWAY! Do not disturb in ANY hotel that I have EVER stayed means STAY OUT. But they don't care there - they knock anyway. What's more is that if you just don't want maid service at all - doesn't matter - they will NOT let you go more than one day without maid service. They call you and leave you a message that they MUST come into the room to check. Lord. I also asked for a late checkout - I don't mean hours late - I mean one hour late - and they wouldn't do it. Net is - NOT A SERVICE ORIENTED HOTEL and little to NO amenities.In the more ramble category - do NOT let the door man get a taxi for you. He's getting some payola with the taxi drivers and he won't put you in the next one - he will put you in the one where he gets his payoff. And then the other drivers start fighting and get in front of the taxi that the doorman put you in. AND! - in my case - I watched all this ensue, knew I should get out of the taxi the doorman put me in and go to the other one / the one that was next in line - BUT - it almost looked dangerous out there -- the other drivers and mine were so getting into it. And I was going from Park Central to EWR and the door man put me in a city city city taxi - teeny weeny - the plexiglass burglary bullet proof glass was RIGHT IN MY FACE - it was hella claustrophobic - and for a NYC to New Jersey drive - they should have put me in a larger taxi or SUV. And well here again - I really should have gotten out; but I followed the instructions of the door man - but never again.Also, you could die of exhaustion or starvation, and *will most definitely be late for any meeting* you have, waiting on the elevators! Geez louize! The elevators are slow as molasses.Net net net is - the hotel is grossly overpriced for a little to no service, no amenities property. No room service. No 24/7 room/drink access without getting dressed and leaving the hotel. Horrible lighting in room and bathroom. No robes. And don't let the door man get you a taxi; get one yourself. And rooms majorly need a face lift. I would say most of the clientele are not very high class - so neither the hotel or guests are elegant by any stretch of the imagination.

This hotel is rated at 4*, I would say it is probably around 3*.The good points are its excellent location, very comfortable beds, very clean.The bad points are BE WARE there is a compulsory $35 plus tax charge per room per night for the complimentary services that we did not want to use, so the price we paid worked out around $500 more than advertised online by Hotels.com; very tired drab décor, all gloomy grey and brown colours (not a modern take on those, but closer to the 1980s), not powerful showers but they seem to have been refurbished, so are clean. The customer service is rubbish in practice but excellent in words. We wanted to change the location of our interconnecting rooms as we had a noisy bin lorry under the windows throughout the night (although we were on 11 floor, the windows are not very well insulated so can hear everything) ,so asked if anything can be done, the manager on the front desk offered to change our rooms to the opposite side of the hotel. We specifically asked if it would be possible to have interconnecting rooms (we had children with us) and not be near the lifts. So after spending an hour packing and waiting for new keys we were told our new rooms were ready, imagine our surprise when we found out that the rooms were not interconnecting, one was near the lifts and the other on the exactly the same side of the building as the original rooms and both on the lower floor, so closer to the lorry! We then spend 30 min more unpacking in our original rooms and were wondering what the manager was thinking in offering to change the rooms and offering exactly what we did not want!

This was the latter,Going to be as concise as one can be.Pros:Location - that's it!Cons: 1. Check-in is at 4pm. This is unheard of. I've never experienced any hotel in the world that has a 4pm check-in time. I tried checking in at 2p and 3p, my room wasn't ready. Was ready by 3:45pm.2. Rooms are OK, at least mine was. However, I did not get any sun whatsoever during my 4-night stay. The closet has no light. Rooms are very small. 3. On the day of check out, I called at 8am for a late checkout, they said they'll let front desk call me back to confirm. They never did. I called back at 9am, and they told me the same thing. They never called back. I called back at 9:45am and complained, they apologized saying they can't give me a late check out. So after waiting for almost 2 hours, I still couldn't get a late checkout. I explained how bad their service was, so they gave me a checkout till 1pm. So so generous of them.Class ""A"" Thieves:1. First day at the hotel, I asked guest services if I can ship packages to the hotel and they said yes. I asked if they charged, they told me it was free. (This can be verified with their phone records as all phone calls are recorded). Upon checkout, I was charged $30 storage fee. I had 3 packages come in, and it turns out they charge $10 per package. Again, I've never seen this done by any hotel whatsoever. We went back and forth about the charges for a good 5 minutes and asked them if they could waive it, they were so adamant that they wont, and never did. 2. Resort fees. Beware. They charge you $35 + tax per day per night (excluding the room rate). 90% of people won't use 90% of what is associated with those fees. I clearly explained upon checkout that I was unaware of this and it should've been mentioned clearly upon check in, and see if they can (partially) waive it. But It's like watching paint dry, they are useless. I spoke to their guest services manager (forgot her name, of Asian descent), and she was probably one of the most useless individuals I have ever came across, in the likes of which, I've never seen before. I came to find out that my friend stayed in the hotel next to Park Central who also had similar resort fees but they were nice enough to give him a one-time waiver as he was unaware of them. I paid almost $200 for resort fees and storage fees extra upon checkout. Never experienced such thing. I hope whoever reads this change their minds about staying there. I am more than willing to provide info about other hotels around the same area. Just please stay away from this.","Chicago, Illinois","lmasterz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",25,1.0

I know that at times, it is hard to keep up an impeccable level of service when managing a large staff that serves hundreds of rooms. However, this hotel has left me and my family impressed at how bad our overall experience was. From reception to our room to the disrespectful and dismissive manner of the manager on duty, I genuinely felt that they were trying to make our stay as bad as it was.First, when we arrived with our reservation, they told us that we had to pay a resort fee of $35 per night. When my husband asked what was the fee for, the agent said he wasn't even sure.When we tried to take the elevator, we didn't know how to use it, it would have been appropriate if someone explained this, but no big deal, we figured it out and brushed it off.The room. WOW!!! Nasty is not enough to describe, endless stains on the carpet, the walls, paint peeling off, the toilet paper holder was broken, the phone only worked on speaker mode. UNSAFE! We had our two little kids with us and they like to explore drawers, to their surprise, the drawers very easily come off to the floor towards their precious feet, not one, three of them! (make sure to scroll through the pictures on their profile, only the nice ones show up first, I guess paying yelp a monthly fee to enhance their profile goes a long way!).Even more disgusting: when we came back from our day out, I found a nasty smelly wet rag under our clothes. Obviously not ours.TWICE I had to use the stairs all the way up to 7th floor due to their failing elevator system. One morning we got stuck trying to go down to start our day and ended up waiting 30 min for the elevator (which never came). I had to use the stairs all the way down to ask for help, since I've worked in hotels I knew they must have service elevators, however, the ""manager"" apologized and said there was nothing they could do, she quickly blamed a guest for ""pushing the wrong button and breaking the elevator "" and proceeded to tell me it was gonna be 30-40 min before it was fixed and suggested we took the stairs with our two little kids and their stroller. Her manner that day was arrogant and I felt that she was very annoyed with my observations. After I ran back all the way upstairs to get my kids and husband, there was another family waiting for the elevator. Luckily, there was a staff member who overheard our situation and offered to let us use the service elevator, it was appalling to me that he quickly figured out what to do vs. his manager. The next morning I looked for the hotel manager again and tried to explain in very simple and friendly words our disappointment with the service and room. At first, her manner was again rather serious and non-empathetic, until I showed her pictures of the nasty rag we found and the drawers that easily come off potentially injuring our kids. At that point, she became very friendly, she offered a room upgrade, free breakfast, and to waive the resort fee. We didn't want to change rooms because it was more of a pain with our stuff and the kids than it was worth it, we didn't want to eat breakfast there, and she only waved 2 days worth of the resort fee instead of 3 as she said she would.When I mentioned that when we booked we weren't aware of the resort fee and kind of room we'd get, I explained we did it through Hoteltonight.com, to which she had the need to mention 3 TIMES that they had the lowest rates around. To this, I responded ""do you mean that we paid for what we got?"", of course, she denied it, but it was well implied. So yes, we got a cheaper rate, we still spent about $600 for 3 nights at this hotel, and we felt it wasn't worth it. These rooms are supposed to be $400 per night rooms, how do they get away with this is beyond me. Please save yourself the frustration and the extra few bucks and book elsewhere.",,Mudget,3,1.0

My feedback is:- they charged an additional $35 (plus tax) each night for 'services' like luggage hold, business lounge etc - even if you don't use them. This was compulsory but not included when I paid for the rooom online. Be warned that you will need to pay this when you check out as it's on top of the original room rate! - Cleanliness of the room was not great - the bathroom had dust and hair in it. - Didn't have the 'do not disturb' signs, so every morning the cleaners came knocking!- The bed was comfy though - but cleaning generally not great. - There were 2 lifts servicing floors 3-9, they were very small, and one kept breaking down. Which meant there were queues to use the lifts (and I am not climbing the stairs to 7th floor with bags!). - Breakfast was in the form of a little coffee shop - overpriced though. - Staff were friendly - Location was great","London, United Kingdom","Tash E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,3.0

It was very clean and well equipped, including a bathtub - something I've found to be increasingly rare in NYC hotels. Speaking of NYC hotels, the room was pretty big for a Manhattan property - the size would be considered adequate or better almost any place, much less in the Big Town. Check-in was quick and friendly, and the staff helped us immediately when one of our key cards decided not to work in either the room lock or the elevator (the key card is required for access to the guest floors, a good security feature). The neighborhood was very safe, and there were plenty of places to eat close by at OK prices. The hotel has a very attractive bar/restaurant, but we didn't eat there.For the record, because we were traveling in a large group (about 70 of our chorus members were staying there), we got a very favorable rate - but the rate would have been reasonable for NYC hotels in any case.We enjoyed our stay here very much and would be happy to stay here any time...","Washington DC, District of Columbia","GaNavy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",17,4.0

She told me to purchase at the hotel as they can often get deals for us, stop by when we arrived. We did that and purchased tickets from Jemel Spand, the Concierge on staff that day. He was behind the desk next to check in with the concierge sign right there. He told us we were getting really great seats, how lucky we were. He sent the tickets via email a while later.. The tickets we paid 149.99 each for had a face value of 89 each. I asked about the 60% markup, he said they got a deal, that was not what the tickets were really selling for. I went on line and found the same row for the same price... all in it would have cost us $99 per person purchasing directly from the theater. After sending several emails, leaving voice mail and talking with him again, we went to the hotel manager who said he understood our concern and said he would check into it. Later they said the Concierge is not a hotel employee, he works for the company that purchased the tickets. By putting him behind their counter, they are endorsing his pricing. I asked the hotel to help get some of our $120 overcharge back, they did nothing. PLEASE BE AWARE, the Concierge is not employed by the hotel and WILL rip you off big time!!! We also asked for a room with a view, they put us in the inner court, we could see the other rooms in the hotel via the windows and the roof below us. Horrible view.

We asked for a quiet room at check in and were given a 5th-floor room facing a wall with an adjoining door - we had to listen to our neighbors as though we were all sitting in the same room together. On our last night, our hall was overrun with teenage boys who seemed to be without adult supervision- it was 1AM before the manager and security were able to get them quieted down for the evening and when we left for our flight at 6AM the next morning there were pizza boxes piled up everywhere.

Overall, the staff were friendly and willing to help and advise on touristy questions. The room price was about average for NYC. But be aware, when booking you are not told about the facilities charge of $40 per night, per room. It’s a charge for some things you may or may not use during your stay at the hotel. An email informs you of this a few days before your trip and the paper bill is slipped under your door on your last night.

The hotel situates close to the parade route and right on the marathon route. Front staffs were handling big crowds efficiently, so check-in was quick. We arrived early in the morning, so our room was not available. I requested lower level of room for the reason of accessibility. However, we were given 16th floor when we came back @3 p.m. to check in. I thought that it was very busy weekend with groups, so they ran out of lower level rooms. Our room 1628 was a ""cave"". It locates very end of the hallway and the view from large window was literally brick walls of next building because it faces inward. Quiet... yes, because we are the end of the hallway. Dark... very much because no sunlight could come through due to the hight of next building. Even with all room lights on, we felt like the room was at night. The room seemed to be remodeled recently, but not completely, I saw chipped paints on the front door, the corner of windowsills, bathroom floor... felt like that we were assigned the left-over room. We used ""Roomer"" to get discount which actually was from Expedia. It was discounted, but no less than hotel's advertised rate of $175/night. Luckily, we did not stay in the room too long, and again, knowing how crowded the hotel was, I did not make effort to request for another room. Bathtub stopper did not work. Water pressure for shower was sufficient, but as many reviews mentioned, toilet water pressure was weak. Plenty of towels, but all shampoo, conditioner, body wash bottles are mounted on the bathtub wall. I prefer individual travel size bottles for sanitary reason. No plastic linings for trash bins. Overall, the room amenity did not justify the price they charge. It should be less than $100 per night for what they are.Elevators: Although there are 4 elevators, only 2 were working. As many reviews, I agree that the elevator size was small. Extra security of activate floor stop with your room key was Okay... One elevator's bottom did not light up for the floor selection, so it was confusing. The speed was sufficient. However, considering may guests, especially international guests with large suitcases, the elevator filled up very quickly. They should have a bell service to bring all large suit cases with flight elevators to each guest rooms. Billing: unknown charge appeared from hotel twice without explanation from the front staff at the time of check-in, so I had to call back and to send email to billing department.The location is vey convenient for Upper Westside tourism.

The two people at guest relations said they couldn’t help me, to go ask the concierge. I was then told by another employee that the concierge went home at 6pm. How does such a large hotel not have one person who could answer one question? That was frustrating. We ended up spending $300 on an overpriced Italian restaurant down the street. My husband and I couldn’t go have a drink at the bar until 8 pm because it was closed all day for a private event. There was a shop, but I only saw it open once the entire stay. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel. I’m torn on whether I would stay there again or try another place.

Park Central guaranteed, and confirmed in writing, that all rooms would be on the same floor, and that we would have ""deluxe queen"" beds for our student rooms. This would allow them to share beds.It wasn't until we checked into our rooms that we realized that wasn't true. Many of the beds were double beds -- and 17-year-old high school boys particularly weren't able to double up in such a small space.The queen beds were the perk that Park Central used to persuade us to stay with them, rather than our original choice. The floor of the hotel was the same one they agreed to, in writing. And they were apparently waiting to see if we noticed the contract was broken. I let them know on March 1st, shortly after our arrival.I reminded Park Central (as per our original agreement) that we needed to be on one floor as a group, as students needed to remain near chaperones. The next morning, they told us that one of our rooms would be exchanged for an actual Double Queen room, and that the girls in it needed to move out immediately. They did -- and still hadn't been given a new room by late afternoon. That made changing and preparing for our competition throughout the day -- there were a mix of committee sessions and NYC tours -- much more difficult and rather inconvenient. Finally, in the evening, they received their room.Eleven days later, I am still waiting for a refund -- both for a discount on the cost of the rooms (as they were not the rooms we paid for) and for a room refund that we let the hotel know a month in advance (after our early payment) that we would not be booking. For each, Park Central assured us there would be a refund. Since our stay, I have not received a reply.I will be happy to update this review if we receive a reply and refund. It's unfortunate that what could have been a pleasant stay was marred by dishonesty and lack of follow-through.PS: One other thing worth noting is that the rooms, which we arranged in advance of the trip to have refrigerators, did not.

The hotel clearly mentions the administrative charges. So, before I made my booking, I was aware of this fee. Personally, I never thought that these fees are justified. But the net damage to my pocket even after this fee was not too much, because I got a good discount on room charge. The net charge I paid was comparable to any similar NYC hotel. But this hotel had an advantage of the location. Now, the two reasons I have rated this hotel as Average:1. No coffee maker in the room. I think this is a very basic amenity. They should have considered this. 2. If you order any online shopping merchandise at the hotel address, the hotel charges $10 for handling the package. I think this is outrageous.

As NYC residents, I wanted to book a nice hotel room to feel like we were on vacation for one night without having to leave the city-and it was all going to be a surprise! This is not the right hotel for a nice night in the city. I figured for paying over $300 for one night, the room would be at least a little special. The room was small, had no qualities that I think made it a ""premier"" room as it was advertised on the website, and the cushy chair in the room had a large brown stain on it. When I went to turn the TV on, half of the channels did not come through because of 'poor connection.' My premier room was also directly across from the elevators, and I could hear everyone on the floor coming and going during the few minutes I was in the room. I called down to guest services to see if we could switch rooms to another room within the same price-the guest representative said he had to speak to his manager and would give me a call back. After waiting 20 minutes and not hearing anything, I decided this hotel reservation as not worth the cost and my husband and I would be more comfortable staying at home that night even if it meant eating the money I spent on the 'surprise.' I went to guest services, and as I expected since I was cancelling my reservation within the 24 hours window before my reservation started, I would be charged for the night. I also found out when I thought I would be charged $305 for the room (as per my confirmed email from Hotels.com where I booked the room), I would be charged $395-between mandatory charges for amenities I was not even using and taxes I was way overcharged for what that room would have been.Lesson learned-don't book at Park Central Hotel when wanting a nice hotel room for the night.

The breakfast still sounded first as something worth something. How wrong was I. It was ridiculous. You get a coupon to be used at the take-out kiosk cafe. You can have a croissant, one hot or cold drink and one more item which was specific (I don’t even remember what anymore as I didn’t want it).I did not want croissant, but sandwich. I also wanted both the orange juice and the coffee. With those three items and I had to pay almost 10 dollars extra. It was printed in the coupon, so the kiosk followed the rules.

After making a shortlist and reading 100s of confusingly conflicting reviews, we settled on Park Central and it was perfect for our stay. We wanted a handy central location, ideally near Central Park. Tick! Park Central is one block from Central Park, enabling me to go for a morning run, adding an exciting (and freeeeezing!) post to my Strava profile and easy walking distance to Broadway, Times Square and other major attractions. It needed to be clean and well maintained. I didn’t mind about it being especially ‘fancy’ but I didn’t want to spend a special two days in an amazing city and come back with my children to a room that was grotty. I was a little concerned before our arrival about a number of reviewers that reported damp rooms, disrepair, slow/bad service, rooms not ready. I think maybe there has just been a major refurb recently if older reviews are to be believed or I don’t know which hotel they were reviewing at all! We found Park Central to be very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The whole hotel - lobby, lounge area as well as our room and bathroom - were classy and elegant, far more so than you’d get for the price in London and very spacious too. We were greeted by the most friendly, cheerful bellman/Porter/valet Parker who took all of our bags and greeted us in and out of the building every time we came and went. We were hours too early for our room so intended to leave our bags and head out to explore. However, reception staff quickly checked us in and we were shown straight up to our beautiful room in minutes. Quick turn around an we were dressed for the weather and out on our adventure. We chose a dual aspect room with views over the front corner of the hotel, towards the park and it was beautiful. We had two double beds, and armchair and footstool, desk and chair, clothing storage and a good sized bathroom with a bath and shower. There was good free WiFi, a pad and pencil and some lovely (local?) aromatherapy toiletries in the bathroom. Other than that, nothing else included in the room - no drinks making facilities and no free TV as far as we could make out. But for our visit, these things didn’t matter. The Park Market in the lobby was very well stocked with quite a good choice of breakfast items - fruit salad pots, yoghurt, pastries, cereals, juice, hot drinks and packed lunch items - crisps/chips, sandwiches... All a little pricy but everything we had was nice. We asked about bringing takeout food to our room one evening and they said it was fine and even offered to find and order what we wanted. (We stepped out ourself and found a great pizza place a few yards away on the same side.)All in All, for a very busy few days with young children, Park Central was a great location, a standard of style to make it feel really special, clean and comfortable to collapse after a long day and well looked after by professional and extremely friendly staff. Would thoroughly recommend it to couples and families. The ONLY thing I would’ve added to make it perfect was to be able to have a coffee in bed, made in our room.

We stayed for seven nights while visiting New York. I'll split my review into different parts for ease of reading:The roomWe didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we wanted to maximise our stay in NYC by being out and about. The room had two double beds, a TV, fridge and a bathroom. The side tables near the bed had outlets which were handy for phone charging. The shower was a lovely pressure and the bathroom was large enough for getting ready each day. The only main issue was that there was no overhead light which we found quite strange - you had to rely on the lamps in the room to provide the light. Even opening the blind over the window did not assist as the sun was blocked by the rest of the building. However, this is not a dealbreaker - the room was wonderfully comfortable for our needs - it was always made up when we returned and the beds were super comfortable.The Location:Central. Convenient. If you are looking for somewhere convenient to stay, this is definitely it. A block from Columbus Circle/Central Park, a 10 minute walk down to Times Square and on the same block as a main Subway line, this hotel was super well located. There were always taxis waiting outside and plenty of room for an uber/lyft to pick you up. The coffee place next door made amazing coffee and was a good first stop for us each day before we headed out. The Service:The front desk was lovely and we always got assistance when needed. I ordered a pair of shoes online and had them delivered to the hotel and they held it for me BUT they charged a holding fee so beware of that. There was always a welcoming face upon our return - regardless of how late/early it was and checkout was a breeze.Extras/Hints:There is a $70+ resort fee PER day, so just a warning. There are two lifts to access and they are always busy - if you don't have bags, use the stairs it will save you so much time! (we were only on the third floor, so this was easier for us, this won't be the case if you're higher up obviously!)We did a hop on/hop off tour on our last day for fun, and the hotel has a little history we didn't realise - definitely worth googling!Overall I would likely stay here again/recommend to a friend.","Sydney, Australia","spuffy_c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",36,4.0

Our room was nice, clean with modern decor, however, it lacked modern facilities you might expect in a 4* hotel such as USB plugs or a mini fridge which was disappointing for the price we paid (about £1200). As expected, the hotel shop where you could get water/drinks/snacks was ridiculously expensive, I think we paid almost twenty dollars for a few bottles of drink and a bar of chocolate the first night! Needless to say we didn’t shop there again, there are plenty of shops locally. Another disappointment was the hotel lifts. For such a large hotel they had very few lifts, and all very slow, which always seemed to result in a lengthy wait and then letting a couple go by as they were too full.One evening we were staying we went down to the bar to find out it was shut for a private event. When we enquired when it was opening we were quite abruptly told there had been an email about it (although not everyone checks these while away) and that it was closed all evening, no apologies for any inconvenience caused or anything. However, on a different note the waitress at the bar (Nancy) was great the few times we did visit, although she always seemed to be the only one serving so service was slow, but she was always very polite despite being rushed off her feet!Overall we had a nice stay, the location of the hotel is brilliant as you are never far from anything including the subway. However, for the price we paid (including hefty facilities fees) we would stay somewhere else if we were to return to New York. We had previously stayed at a nearby hotel for example that included two hours of drinks/snacks every evening which was a nice touch.

After 4 days, it gets a bit grim. Secondly, the daily facilities charge is a bit cheeky and certainly does not help create a good memory of the hotel.

In the past, we found it to be an affordable, well-run hotel at a very good location in Manhattan. This time, we were a bit disappointed.We had requested a King bed when we made our reservation, but were told at check-in that, despite our reservation made weeks in advance, none were available. The front desk receptionist made no effort to accommodate our request. Unlike our experience before, the front desk agent was unapologetic and condescending.We finally settled for a double queen room on the seventh floor. We were told that we had to wait until 4 pm for a room because they were all being cleaned. When we finally got to our room, we found it to be only marginally clean. The carpet had not been vacuumed. The glasses had obviously been used by the previous occupants and were not replaced. The beds were obviously made up in a hurry as the sheets did not stay in place when we retired for the night. We had to remake the beds. The bath tub hardware was broken and laying in the tub. The room attendants had made no effort to repair the tub and had not reported it to maintenance.To be fair, when we reported these inconveniences to the manager, he promptly took care of the issues and offered us compensation. We had no further issues until check-out day when our room keys were electronically deactivated an hour prior to checkout time. When we returned from a late breakfast, we were not able to access our room even though we had more than an hour before checkout at noon.We hope this was an unusual stay that will not be repeated when we return because the Park Central's location - close to Central Park, Time's Square, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall and our favorite restaurants and shopping - is excellent for our purposes.","Austin, Texas","RickJacobiTexas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",11,4.0

HERE'S WHY!On July 24th a lightning strike burned my house down. Since then life has been rough to say the least as I’m a single mother of twin 5 year old daughters. So, I booked a 4 night stay at Park Central Hotel (12/8/17-12/12/17) even though it wasn’t really in the budget because I really wanted to surprise my daughters with an amazing Christmas time trip! I thought a few days of ice skating in Rockefeller Center and Macy’s Santaland would be just what we needed to forget about having lost everything in our worlds. I thought, do it now, money is money, memories are forever. So I got down to the business of planning!I booked my stay online and specified I needed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY. Then I called because I wanted to make sure we got a rollaway and I knew that was a request only item and this trip was VERY important to me! They confirmed all was great and the notes were on my reservations, they said “make sure you call the hotel directly just in case.” So I DID! I called the hotel DIRECTLY! Spoke to the HOTEL STAFF DIRECTLY and confirmed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY! I felt confident and went about making reservations for the rest of the trip.Fast forward to arriving at the hotel. We walk up to the desk with my, now exhausted, twin 5 year old daughters in tow, at around 6:30pm. The RUDE woman at the desk says that she has me down for two queen beds. I remind her of the rollaway I’ve called about and she says “no way ma’am, that’s a fire hazard, you can’t have a rollaway in ANY of those rooms”. WHAT!!! I tell her I’ve called the hotel DIRECTLY and they’ve told me that it’s on my reservation and won’t be a problem at all. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY! She says “yes ma’am I can see that you called, I have that here, but we can’t put a rollaway in those rooms so it’s not happening. It’s a fire hazard.” Again, WHAT!!!! So I tell her I need the bed and they already confirmed it, if it couldn’t be done then they SHOULD have told me ON THE PHONE. I tell her they need to put us in a room with enough space and she says “sorry, we’re fully booked.” Agaaain, WHAT!!!!! I am about to cry at this point because I’ve literally used all the money I have to take my daughters on this trip and we are now in New York and it is too late to undo anything and she says “you can have a breakfast voucher.” !!!!! WHAAAAT!!! The voucher that pays for a muffin and a juice! REALLY! The room was $450 a NIGHT!!!! So when I start to freak out she says “look I can move you to a queen bed with a pull out couch, we can fit a rollaway in there.” I tell her if that’s the case I need to have my room fee adjusted because I paid for two BEDS, not a bed and a old couch, and she smirks and says “no. That’s a suite, your lucky we can even put you in that.” I WAS SO UPSET!!! She did not care at all! NOT AT ALL! No apology! NOTHING! I asked if they could apply an active duty military discount (my travel companion had his ID present for them to view if needed) to offset costs and she laughed and ignored me! So...what? You also don’t care about the military?? I was desperately trying to fix what YOUR STAFF had ROYALLY messed up and was getting mocked in the process! I gave up and spent the next 20 minutes waiting for one of the TWO elevators that service all the floors of your hotel to have room to carry us to our 6th floor “suite” with one bed, a pullout, a rollaway and a $450 a night price tag. (Oh and I didn’t even get the “breakfast”, the RUDE woman in the HORRIBLY OVERPRICED shop said I couldn’t have “that muffin” bc it “wasn’t covered by the voucher” and I “had to choose from those ones” so I got mad and gave up.)Well, Park Central. You should be ASHAMED of yourself!! Your behavior and treatment of my family and I makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH! I hope that those among you that own and operate your facility never find yourself standing in front of your home watching everything you love and worked so hard to acquire burn to ash in front of you! And I hope than that if it does, when you finally see a crack of light peeking through the clouds, there isn’t a smirking rude monster of a business that doesn’t care about its customers AT ALL waiting to crush you even further down. You took $2000 dollars from me and I slept on a piece of garbage uncomfortable old pullout for four days.My only question:ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?!","Leander, Texas","SlyTraveler80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leander, Texas</strong>",6,1.0

I appreciate that if you are after a hotel in a convenient location in mid-town, then the pricing is not bad. But what a price to pay. The good points: good location, it is clean, and the room cleaning staff were an absolute delight - simply lovely. That's about it on the plus side. On the negative side: the rooms are small and cramped, and the lighting is woefully inadequate - in particular the desk area where you can work is almost in complete darkness. They do not even provide shower caps, which I would have thought was standard. The plug in the bath did not work properly, but at least they provided two flannels, one of which could be used to bung it up. The lifts are very slow and do not have enough capacity, leading to long waiting times. I usually bond with the reception staff, but there was none of that here - very much lacking in any charm. Then there is piped music everywhere - you cannot get away from it. When I came to check out there was a very long queue and one person on the desk when there is provision for three. I actually thought of calling the hotel on my mobile to see if they could put more staff on to hurry things up. This hotel left me feeling cold, and despite having meetings after I checked out, I preferred to carry my luggage around Manhattan rather than having to face going back to the hotel.

While there is both a thermostat and a fan unit of some sort in the room itself, nothing we attempted caused a change to the room temperature. When we went to the front desk to inquire about the in-room air conditioning, which is an advertised amenity on the hotel website, the clerk behind the desk advised that it was 62 degrees outside and ""it would be stupid to be running the air conditioner."" Her appalling lack of customer service and inappropriate conduct aside, it doesn't take a great deal of wisdom to determine that the outside temperature does not necessarily dictate the temperature of an interior room, on the fourth floor of a large hotel. I made several phone calls attempting to reach a manager both that evening and the following evening, was told each time that a manager would get back to me shortly and I never received such a call. What was ultimately ""explained"" was that, despite their advertisement to the contrary, the hotel runs on one, old pipe, so, it's either air conditioning or heat or nothing at all for everyone in the building at the same time with no variation or individual room control. We were offered another room; however, given that there was no air circulating anywhere in the hotel, the room change made absolutely no difference.

I was upgraded and my room had a nice view from the 14th floor. The room was large for any standard let alone New York. The room and bathroom were stylish. The hotel did a nice renovation. The bed was huge, King size, and plush. Wonderful to sleep and felt rested. The area wasn’t very loud at all. The staff is great, absolutely professional and friendly.

I'm a social person but sometimes I like the option or eating alone, in my room. There is no mini bar in the room, no bottled water, no coffee machine. Because the location is good, there are places near by where you can buy super expensive water, drinks and take away for your room (Starbucks on corner). After having travelled, the very least I expect is a bottle of room temperature water!I bought a bottle of wine to enjoy in my room one evening. There was a tiny ice bucket but no cork screw... I called the front desk to have one brought up to my room and was told because there was no in room dining, there was no cork screws! But the bar would open my wine if I took it to them. The bartender happily did so but it was an inconvenience.The first day I arrived there was no bath matt, the final day of my stay there was no hot water so I was forced to take a cold shower!Seeing that what I consider the basics are missing and the hotel is still pretty expensive, I wouldn't stay here again.

I am not used to dark rooms. we were given vouchers for breakfast at their store which provided us with our choice of 2 breads, 2 fruit, and one coffee. ONE COFFEE for 2 people? Really?

As soon as you step out of the hotel you know that you are in bustling NYC. A few subway stops are within a block of the hotel so you can get pretty much anywhere. I'll echo what others have said about the elevators in that you often have to wait quite a while, and they are smaller than more modern elevators so you may have to wait through at least one load if you aren't first in line. We were on the 3rd floor so we always took the stairs down, never the elevator--saved us a ton of time (and the stairwells are clean and just fine).

I'm a military veteran and had just graduated college; my commencement ceremony took place in New Jersey and we decided to spend the rest of the weekend and Monday in NYC to celebrate. First the positives... hotel was nice, very conveniently located in midtown and offered easy access to many subway stations, restaurants and Times Square (which is literally just down the street). Room was clean, we had our own private bathroom and the staff was generally very pleasant (with the exception noted below). Unfortunately, I was caught by surprise by the ""mandatory"" facilities fee; this is disclosed to you upon check-in and I was forced to have $150 debited from my card before even receiving my key. What were we to do at that point, cancel the reservation and try to find another room in the middle of NYC on a moment's notice? I had made the reservation weeks in advance and felt we were stuck either paying up or finding a bench in Central Park to sleep on. Their notion of ""mandatory"" is, in my opinion, fraudulent practice and an easy way to bilk guests out of more money regardless of what amenities they use. I don't know if this is just the way hotels do things in NYC in general but I was not prepared for it. Unlike many of their guests (presumably), we are not extremely well off, even booking this trip really strained our budget to begin with. But we wanted to do it because we love NYC and hadn't been there in years. We did not use a single extra amenity during our entire stay - we used the room to sleep, shower and dress before going out into the town, that's it. Upon checkout, I asked the clerk if there was any flexibility on that mandatory charge since we literally didn't use anything and she rudely replied that its mandatory, no exceptions. So this hotel basically took $104 from me in exchange for absolutely nothing. Regardless of whether or not this is common practice with NYC hotels, in my world I call that stealing. Furthermore, the ""amenities"" described by their disclosure are mostly things that other hotels simply include in the nightly rate (i.e., fitness center, parking, use of computers, etc.). We didn't even use the hotel's wifi. I paid nearly $800 for our 3-day stay only to be charged another $100+ for absolutely no reason whatsoever. If we had used any of those things, fine - but we didn't. Yet it is still somehow mandatory. This facilities fee is a complete scam. Perhaps those guests who are a bit more affluent aren't bothered by this but folks like us who stretched our budget quite thin already in order to experience a much more comfortable stay in NYC are getting ripped off it. I left feeling very aggravated and disappointed overall with this hotel. It put a damper on our enjoyment of the city overall and those extra charges prevented us from doing a few of the things we had wanted to do while there. I feel that charging for extra services that a guest actually uses is fair, but to charge them regardless simply because somewhere it's hotel policy that it be ""mandatory?"" Theft. Plain and simple. They took money from me and for things I or we never used or even touched. It should be illegal, this policy. Should we ever go back to NYC this hotel will NOT be on our list of places to stay. We will find someplace that doesn't bilk us out of additional money in exchange for nothing.","Tampa, Florida","Rob C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",1,2.0

The hotel location is great, near to subways. Definitely a good hotel for those who likes to venture the city.Cons: Service is way below the average, receptionists were unwelcoming. Honestly, I feel that the service staff at the concierge and guest relation counter did not go the extra mile to help the guest, for example when I was standing at the empty guest relation counter, the conceirge staff was just there at his own counter pretending not to see us. We did not expect him to serve us but atleast just acknowledge our presence or to assure that someone will be assisting us soon.Twice on different occasions, we were being directed from one counter to another just to receive our parcel from amazon that were being charged for handling fee per item. (There is no information and clause on this. We ended up paying US$50 just like that. If we have known, we would have asked the deliveryman to call us directly instead)And this may sound surprising but for a big hotel like Park Central, I have observed and experienced myself that different guests were being treated differently in term of customer service. As long as you look asian or tanned looking, you will not be treated equally like other guests, which is very disappointing.Overall, I was happy with my one week stay in New York but the service experience of the hotel is definitely not my top five. It would be a waste for a nice hotel like this to be tarnished by staff that are not well-groom with customer service knowledge and skills.

The location is very central, between Times Square and Central Park, but if this is your first trip to NYC its the wrong place to stay. All the charm of NYC is to be able to step outside your door and be in one of its neighbourhoods, with a cafe, a bistro, a Chinese laundry and a bodega at the corner, interesting shops, beautiful houses and architecture, and the different ethnic elements... all that colour its varied environments.This midtown area is full of big hotels, food chains and tourist traps.

It's just that in the same price range, there are so many hotel choices in mid-town Manhattan, and so many that are better in many ways.First, there is a lot to like about the Park Central Hotel. The property is centrally located to all things mid-town. The theaters, Central Park, Times Square, Carnegie Hall, and several museums. The property is very well maintained. The public areas are newly appointed, modern and accessible. We had a room on a lower floor so I can't comment on views, but I can say an interior facing room is quiet, unlike what I imagine with street facing rooms. So, we appreciated the quiet. As with the public spaces, our room was also very clean, upon arrival and after every day's housekeeping.In one way the Park Central Hotel was a standout. Service. We were guests for four nights so we had many occasions to interact with a variety of staff. To a person they were helpful, professional, accommodating, informative and simply nice people. And I'm referring to housekeepers and maintenance men on up to the desk agents and managers we encountered. The staff is well trained and it seems like they enjoy working at the Park Central Hotel, or at least they don't hate it to the point where guests suffer from their annoyance with management.The reason I wouldn't consider the Park Central Hotel for a return visit seems down to management actually. Or at least management policies and practices that directly impact guests. When we arrived we immediately noticed the room lacked several amenities one would expect at this price point. There was no coffee/tea maker, no refrigerator and no self-service food/bar items. And the ice maker on our floor was inoperable upon our arrival. To their credit, the machine was quickly repaired.Also, several lamps were missing from the room. There was a reading chair, but no accompanying reading lamp. And there was no reading lamp on the bedside table of one of us. I immediately requested a coffee maker and lamps. The coffee maker was delivered immediately. The reading lamp came the next day. It took quite a bit longer to get the bedside lamp. Only after requesting it several times, and after the personal assistance of a maintenance person was the lamp delivered. We learned that lamps are often broken and thus swapped around from room-to-room. I put this issue down to management not supplying a sufficient numbers of lamps and not keeping sufficient replacements on hand.The other troublesome issue that I also put down to a management practice is the ""mandatory facilities/resort fee"" of $31.00 per night. For the mandatory fee guests receive:1. Unlimited domestic phone calls2. Unlimited use of the nearby 24 Hour Fitness Center3. Luggage storage upon early arrival or late departure4. Use of computer workstations in the lobby5. Daily USA Today newspapers6. Printing, scanning and faxing available through Guest RelationsRather than comment on these ""amenities"", I'll leave it to the reader to determine if there is value in these items.Room service is not available at the Park Central Hotel. This was the most surprising deficiency.","Oakland, CA","Porsche_Guy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, CA</strong>",85,3.0

The checkout person was much nicer. The elevators were small and slow to operate. I wasn't in a rush, so it didn't bother me much, but it was still an inconvenience. The room: when I walked in, I initially felt pleasantly surprised at how nice it appeared. However, when I opened the closet door, there was a soiled towel on the shelf. It was still wet. There was dust and debris all along the baseboards that were both visible to the naked eye and visible when standing. The floors were dirty all over and it immediately made me worry about my belongings. This was the first time I've ever felt an urgent need to protect my luggage from pests/bugs and the hotel environment in general (above and beyond how I normally protect my stuff when traveling). I sealed everything tight and put it all in the tub hoping that nothing got in. The air conditioner also did not work at first, but after a call to the front desk, maintenance came and fixed it. All in all, I wanted to like this place because it looked really nice, but I was left with an overall sense of disgust and some worry.

A very short walk to Central Park, 2 mins from 57th street subway station, numerous restaurants and an easy walking distance to 5th avenue. Of all the places we visited in NY it was our ideal place to stay, in the heart of everything, easy to access the whole city via the subway but also away from the bustle of Times Square and other more busy areas. A simply perfect location. For us personally, being located right next to Central Park was a priority and you can wake up and run round the park each morning as a perfect start the day. If not run, you can walk or cycle (bikes for hire) and just enjoy the beauty and atmosphere of the park. The best bits:Amazing location! See above. The rooms are very clean, the housekeeping staff are very efficient. All staff are friendly and helpful.Rooms are very comfortable- large comfortable bed, large TV, clean adequate bathroom and decent shower, overall very clean and well maintained. Wifi is accessible everywhere in the hotel.Great selection of Diners and other food options very close by. We liked the diner directly across the road (Park Cafe) best for a quick breakfast or lunch - fast service, good value and decent American style menu. Views of Central Park (however you must pay extra for a street facing room).Great gym facility in the hotel.Central Park is a 5 minute walk and has everything you'd expect. It has a dedicated running and cycling track if that's your thing and endless footpaths for walking. A great place to start your day or simply escape the hustle and bustle of the city streets. To be aware of: Upselling - The daily room rate advertised is not the total price you will pay. They add taxes plus facilities charges of $31 for each night you stay. Make sure you book and pay for a street facing room, or you will face internally into a block and see no natural light and the room is dark. The upgrade fee for a street facing room is approx $40 per night but worth it. If you arrive before 4pm and want to check in to your room, you'll be charged an upgrade fee for early check in at approx $61, again worth it if you've been on a long flight and want to shower and freshen up. They do offer a bag drop service also to store your bags if you are happy to wait.The hotel is approximately 1 hour from JFK airport, approx $55 in a yellow taxi. There is a lot of traffic on the way, be prepared with water and snacks if you've come off a long flight. There are no fridges in the room but you can request one. Stock up with water and other drinks at a shop nearby.There isn't a coffee machine in the room either but they sell coffee in the shop downstairs in the hotel lobby and there's numerous coffee shops close by.

You can access the 57th Street Subway Station without leaving the block.Cleanliness was good enough. Location and cleanliness were my priorities when searching reviews prior to booking hotels and this lived up to the reviews I viewed.Lovely bathroom with really hot water and a shower plus bathtub. Superb Wi-Fi which was heavenly for contributing to a great holiday: easily able to locate venues and services, book tickets, checkout opening times…When I had a problem with the bath plug, there was a service man there within minutes. He said they work 24/7. Extra glasses and towelling were not a problem.Included: iron and ironing board; Hairdryer; Reasonably quiet air conditioner.Fairly quiet for sleeping. There were the regular sounds of sirens and car horns, intermittently, but only a few times in the week were they really loud. We were on the 7th floor facing the street – so all in all, pleasant. Fabulous lounge behind the foyer. Good for getting away from the family. Booths for eating in if desired as the rooms were a bit too small for all of us to eat in.Considering you are in the heart of the city, the room is really well organised and quiet.Minuses:No fridge or any coffee making facilities in the rooms. If you and those with you like a couple of cups of coffee a day, be prepared to purchase from cafes or the many Starbucks nearby. Could not keep any leftovers from meals or have something as a middle of the night snack.A microwave for general use would have been great on many occasions. While there are decent pull down blinds, these did not completely block out the bright lights of outside well enough for me. I only slept well when I was wearing my eye mask.In regards to the lighting within the room, there was definitely not enough. Only a couple of lamps and a faint picture light. Not good enough for reading unless you were right under one of the lamps. Luckily we had a window with some natural light during the day.A gorgeous bar but way too expensive: almost $15 each for a small glass of red (after tax and gratuities). It’s no wonder it’s mostly empty.

The location is very good between Time Square and Central Park and is handy for a number of Subway stations and a good selection of bars and restaurants. Got a very good headline rate for the area, however this did exclude the facilities fee (although I did get a couple of emails highlighting this) even with this added the price was still fairly good.Arrived mid evening to discover that the room (king size) which I had booked a couple of months earlier was not available although I was offered a twin queen with the facilities fee waived, which softened the blow. The room itself was pretty good, had a view of an internal court yard, which while initially disappointing was probably a blessing in disguise as it was free from the usual NY chorus of taxi drivers sounding their horns! There were no facilities for making tea or coffee in the room (not sure if that is the US norm?) and there was only a little shop in the hotel for drinks and breakfast. The lounge is very pleasant with excellent staff, they are missing a bit of a trick not doing food, particularly breakfast, which even the ropiest UK hotels will have a go at, and after a hard day doing the sights one or two quiet evenings eating in the hotel might have been nice.All in all I would recommend Park Central if you can get a good deal, but wouldn't recommend paying over the odds.","Woking, United Kingdom","alco636</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woking, United Kingdom</strong>",8,3.0

Our overall impression of the hotel with its correct and professional, but not always friendly, personal and staff is very positive. We had a room on the 9th floor at the hotel backside. Consequently our view below was a kind of inner court (roof of hotel spaces) with hotel installations on top of it. The installations made a monotonous noise, but we didn’t consider that as annoying. The room with perfect beds and many wall sockets was spacious enough and was perfectly cleaned daily. The same counts for the bathroom with a shower in the comfortable low bath, that made it easy to get in. A point of improvement is the poor lighting in the rooms.The location of the hotel couldn’t be better. A subway station is around the corner and at about 400 meters there is the south entrance of the Central Park as well as the Columbus Circle subway station with many main subway lines. Attractions like Times Square, Museum Mile (incl. MOMA), 5th Avenue Rockefeller Building and even Bryant Park and the Empire State Building are at walking distance (if you like to do some walking). The Circle Line Cruises at the banks of the Hudson river is also at walking distance getting you through the Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood with some nice restaurants, which are much cheaper than restaurants near the hotel. To get to other neighbourhoods/ attractions like Coney Island, DUMBO / Brooklyn Heights, 9/11 monument, Brooklyn Bridge, Lower East Side, etc. the nearby subway is perfectly suited. By the way, we bought the NY Explorer Pass online and built our own attraction pass which worked perfectly (skipping the ticket lines!!). Two final remarks: (i) the hotel breakfast, if you booked it, is just 'grab and go';(ii) at arrival 300 dollar is put on hold on your credit card and refunded 4-5 days after checking out (we had never experienced this at a prepaid trip)","Nieuwerkerk aan den Ijssel, The Netherlands","MvdL1952</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nieuwerkerk aan den Ijssel, The Netherlands</strong>",26,4.0

The location is very convenient to go to many places, near to a few subway stations. The hotel is clean and big (as compared to other hotels in nyc).However, there are some negative points for the hotel.1) there are 2 lifts but they can take very long to come down. We have to take the stairs for a couple of time as the wait was long and lift was full. 2) One of the last few nights, we actually didn't ask for housekeeping and put a do-not-disturb at the door knob. However, our room was cleaned despite putting the sign. Yes, it's nice of them to clean but there's a reason why we left the sign outside in the first place. 3) Housekeeper cleared the plastic cups and didn't replace it with new ones. The body shampoo was emptied but not refill throughout the stay. 4) Almost one month after checking out, we realised that our card was charged with a fee. We were told at the reception that it's a refundable hotel deposit. Insisted that we have to use a credit card instead of cash if not we'll need to put a larger amount of cash instead of the original amount. During the last night, we received a piece of paper that said credit the amount, so we assumed that it's the refund of the money. Until a month later, we noticed that our card is being charged and there's a fine print that said we agreed to pay some facilities fee (though nothing was being signed). We felt cheated since we were unaware of the facilities fee and nothing was mentioned; other than the deposit for the hotel. It's not a small amount, 30usd per night, which can total up to be about 270usd for our 9 nights. I think it's about being honest and informed correctly. Not telling us that it's refundable deposit and yet being charged after the stay.",,462selinan,0,4.0

I had very little time to unpack and freshen up before heading to dinner and the theater. Therefore, on my way out I explained the problem to the front desk and was expecting to see a lamp in place when I returned in the late evening. There was no lamp.The next morning, Friday, August 11, I telephoned Guest Services from the room while preparing to go out for the day to inform them a lamp had not been delivered. They apologized and assured me a lamp would be placed in the room. Upon my return in the late afternoon, a lamp was still missing. The message light flashing on the room phone was from Guest Services. They wanted to confirm the delivery of a lamp and make certain everything was to my satisfaction. Frustrated, I telephoned Guest Services. They were surprised to learn a lamp had not been delivered. They assured me they would send a lamp right up. A few hours later I again received a call from Guest Services to confirm delivery of a lamp. I told them that a lamp had not been delivered and asked if there was another Room 1010. At this point I was extremely furious, as I had waited for delivery and missed getting a quick nap before showering and going out for the night. I was now told a lamp would be sent up as soon as one became available. Became available? I told the representative I had checked on-line and there were available rooms from which they could have an available lamp. I also stated that housekeeping should have noticed the missing lamp and reported it when the room was being prepared for my arrival. I would presume the duties of housekeeping is to ensure all furnishings are present in a room and functional.After this conversation, there was no further communication with Guest Services. This saga shows a lack of professionalism and organization within the hotel. Who is telling whom a lamp has been delivered? Who is responsible to ensure a guest’s request. I wrote a letter to the hotel, but to date have not had a response. I frequent this hotel and absolutely love the location to my favorite restaurants and the theater.

Then they marked and charged me as a no-show for Aug. 23, a date on which I never wanted to stay there -- in fact, the date on which I made the reservation from my home on the West Coast. They agreed to cancel that. Because they had neglected to reserve the room I wanted for a week in September, they were willing to make that reservation now -- at a charge of more than $320 per night.

We also discovered upon checking in that there was a $31(USD)/day “resort facilities fee” we would be required to pay - why this wasn’t simply included in the price I’m not entirely sure, but it did mean that when all was said and done we probably weren’t saving that much money by staying here instead of our usual place. It should be noted the website we booked on did mention this fee, but it was listed in a sidebar and easily overlooked - again why it wasn’t simply included in the price, I’m not sure.Checking luggage wasn't an issue, both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out. In fact, the nicest staff we encountered was in the luggage room.The rooms are quite nice - we had a room on the 8th floor by the elevator with two queen beds. The room itself was pretty spacious, with enough room for the four of us and our luggage. Despite the proximity to the elevator, it wasn’t noisy. The beds were very comfortable, with excellent pillows (sometimes a rarity in hotels). The bathroom was quite spacious, and the shower nice and clean. We didn’t have much of a view, in fact our room looked directly at the office building opposite us. The rooms don’t feature a minibar/fridge so if you get leftovers you won’t be able to save them for the next day, but there are ice buckets if you need to chill a beverage. There’s also free WiFi, which is always nice, though in 2017 is somewhat expected. Perhaps the only major annoyance about the hotel are the elevators. There’s only two of them and they are slow and they are small. Expect to wait. There are stairs, and being on the 8th floor meant it wasn’t too much of a hassle to just walk downstairs if we got sick of waiting (but wouldn’t exactly want to have to climb them).There’s a small little store downstairs that sells sandwiches, fruit, pastry and beverages, albeit at a fairly inflated price. You’re likely better off going to the Starbucks that is basically right next door.The reality is we were here for the location, and the price. The hotel was a place to sleep, and it was more the sufficient for that purpose, especially with such comfortable beds and pillows. You are literally steps away from Carnegie Hall, and minutes away from Central Park, Times Square, and Broadway. In terms of location, it’s pretty much perfect, but you can probably find a place just as convenient at a better price.","Markham, Canada","adamschoales</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Markham, Canada</strong>",36,4.0

By the end of or stay - we couldn't wait to leave this hotel. Please take heed of ALL reviews here - as these are accurate and I wish we paid attention to more reviews rather than focusing on the positive reviews. I can imagine if you stayed for one or two nights - you could have a positive experience but our whole experience left a lot to be desired and the least positive by far out of 8 X Hotels we stayed in across the country. In the beginning....Check in experience was cold and impersonal - like most interactions we had in NYC - I can deal with this but when we got to our room after a full day traveling things went downhill...Our first room was on 7th floor - We made a few calls and laid on the bed to relax for a few minutes - this is when we noticed the NOISE from 7th Avenue - I figured the window was left open. Went to close - nope it's closed already. With 5 nights booked for this hotel - this was not tenable! We immediately went to 'Hotel Services' to complain and request a different room... They seemed surprised that we thought it was noisy - surely we are not the only ones to complain about this!? They commented that NY was a 'big city' and we should expect some noise....come on! I bet they wouldn't pay money to sleep in that room. Eventually they were accommodating but informed us they couldn't change our room until the following day...which was better than nothing we figured....Well that night I literally had no more than 2 hours sleep total. The street noise (cars, trucks, sirens, buses etc) was beyond a joke, I cannot over emphasize this enough - but what what took the cake was being able to hear a full conversation between 2 X people at 4am from our room from street level. Needless to say this ruined my next day due to the serious lack of sleep. Thankfully - the next day our room was ready by 3pm (we effectively checked out and in again) and this time was on 12th floor - facing the courtyard. No problems sacrificing a view to avoid the street noise. This room was much better, but only relatively speaking. We still had to deal with the sound and vibration from the room above us - think opening scene of Jurassic Park with the water rippling in the glass as the T-Rex approached. This literally happened. No cell phone service in room either. To be clear: I'm not a noise freak - but have never experienced a hotel like this, EVER! It was like a 4D amusement ride - not the good kind. The bed was terrible, my side of the bed sat at a downward angle like the springs were completely shot. Further to this - The room was tired and fittings were shabby - the toilet roll holder was broken and ignored by housekeeping daily. The fabric used in the bathroom makes the room almost impossible to keep clean. The elevators are ridiculously small and slow. Imagine the cartoons with the 50 x clowns getting out of the single clown cars!! Allow 5-10 minutes to get to the lobby. We requested a fridge - we were given one within about 2 hours of requesting - which was useful. Probably the most positive aspect of our experience! As for the location - which admittedly is good/central but bear in mind this comes with lots of tourist foot traffic. But it is NYC so this comes with the package. But - If I ever stay in NYC again, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on location as the NYC subway system is awesome and so cheap/easy to get around Manhattan (once you get your head around how the lines work and uptown vs. downtown etc). Finally - the 'Resort Fees' - absolute joke! This is simply a way for hotels like this to appear cost effective on the booking sites. We learnt our lesson on this twice on our trip, thinking our prepaid visit was all inclusive.... We got caught with another hotel with this 'tax' but honestly had no problem paying for it in Vegas given the quality of the hotel, room, amenities and staff at the Venetian.

The service, location (a short walk to Central Park on one side and Times Square on the other) and rooms were perfect. I was pleasantly surprised with the staff as I had some reservations after reading Trip Advisor reviews. However, they were very friendly and aimed to please. Service was top notch. My only complaint was that they charge $33 USD per day for resort/hotel fees for things that were basic in virtually any hotel, including basic or budget hotels. These things were use of phone, computers, baggage hotel and use of gym ( for which only 3 out of 100 people use the front desk man told me, who uses a gym while in NYC anyway, you walk so much there's no need or time!. Or if you have a gym it should be pay per use. There were no restaurants, bar only opened at 5, no extras in the room such as mini fridge, coffee maker, etc.. And forget using their little snack bar in the lobby as it is outrageously expensive. Just step out the door and get your snacks anywhere for much less! Aside from this daily hotel fee, which is definitely not warranted, I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are looking to see the sights of NYC without wasting time travelling to them.","Pickering, Canada","wendyhern</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pickering, Canada</strong>",11,5.0

Arrived at the hotel at approximately 11pm. Initial thoughts were positive based on the location of the hotel, with Times Square in our sights. The hotel is situated in the main artery of Manhattan between Times Square and Central Park so it's ideal for first time travelers to experience the hustle and bustle of New York City. As we walked in we were greeted by a very stoic faced receptionist. Being used to over enthusiastic greeters in most of the hotels I've stayed at, I have to say this was slightly underwhelming. However she processed us through fairly quickly and were unpacking before we knew it. The room itself is clean and the beds comfortable, but not much more than that. The views out of the room were shocking, facing a brick wall and other rooms on either side. Not great when the room adjacent to you has an old man who has no issues getting changed in the full view of the general public. However given that we just needed a bed to sleep on this did not bother us too much. Do not buy from the tuck shop in the lobby. Prices are massively inflated, charging $7 for a bottle of water, I hope the water was sourced from the Himalayas itself. I am not surprised the USA is undergoing a massive health and fitness crisis with those prices. However again given the location there are grocery stores nearby who thankfully do not sell goods at extortionate prices. The gym was okay, fitness gurus would be screaming at the lack of barbells. Frankly you're better off getting a 2 hour cardio bike ride in at Central Park every morning.It was raining on the Friday, I was surprised that the hotel did not have any umbrellas for guests but you can purchase any amenities nearby. Again it didn't help having another receptionist who was not helpful.Room service woke us up once, however in fairness to them it was 9am and we didn't have a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door. So make sure you get the door signs if you're not an early bird.I think this is the main takeaway from this review is, it's a decent budget hotel with a great location. Would I stay here again? Probably, but better customer service could work wonders for this hotel.",,Badar R,9,3.0

It was a long weekend break from the UK for my partners' Birthday and our first time in NYC. The really big selling point for this hotel is the prime location - a short walk away from both Times Square and Central Park with excellent links to MTA. The hotel is well presented and the decor smart and modern. Staff were polite, friendly, helpful when required and efficient. The room was really spacious - but the bathroom a little on the tight side - and clean, well equipped and generally smart to the eye. The bed was a big plus - paid a little extra for a big double but, boy, was it worth it! Soft, comfy, big pillows and more sleeping space than I think I've ever had. As a base to explore for three nights it was perfect - the adjustable air con was a plus in August. Good Wifi once we got the right info - and that was really the only niggle, there was no guide to the hotel and it's services available in the room, meaning we had to ask at concierge/reception a lot, e.g. Wifi instructions.

Upon arriving at the hotel, it was quite impressive, nice entrance and lounge, this is as far as our good experience goes unfortunately.We left our bags with the storage room as check in wasnt until 4pm. We returned at 4:00pm, lined up as everyone else did and was told our room was not ready until 4:30pm and to wait in the lounge and someone will come and get us when it is ready. No problems, we got a drink and waited. At 5:00pm I hop back into the line to get an update, and was told she needed to speak with the manager. Approximately 30 minutes later she comes back and says there is a problem with one of the beds in our room. She says she can give us an upgraded room to a Junior Suite (a room on the 18th floor) with 1 king bed and a fold out sofa which is the same size as a queen. I said no problem, we will do that and please give us an update on our Time Square Room which we had paid for. We got given complimentary breakfast at this point (which was only a pastry or fruit and a drink). Went up to room, was not happy with the 'upgrade' as it really was just a fold out sofa and a normal bed. Went back down to reception to let me know we were ok to take that room for the 1 night, however we were not happy to have that room for the entire 4 nights as it is definately not what we had paid for and was a limited view of time square also.The following day, I went to the managers desk and was told there was a room, however we would need to hold our bags in storage, come back at 4pm again and re check in. Said thats fine but we really only have 4 days in New York and we had already spent so much time wasted on this room issue. We got upstairs and started packing when I got a phone call to meet the manager on the 12th floor to see if a room was good to move to. At this point, we just wanted 2 separate normal beds to sleep on. Got to the room, even more limited view of Time Square (legit no view), a king bed and a double bed (we were supposed to have 2 queens) and later realised there was no fridge, no hair dryer, and no body wash left. The manager did advise that he would be waiving the facilities fees for the stay. In the mean time, I had called Laundry services to enquiry about getting our washing done, and they advised me there is no service on the weekends, however if you are wanting just wash and dry (no dry cleaning) that is complimentary and can be arranged at 7am Monday and dropped off at 4:00pm that day.So I called the reception on Sunday night and asked for a hair dryer, body wash and for someone to pick up our bag of washing at 7am. Again I confirmed with them that it was a complimentary service as it is not dry cleaning. I woke up at 7:45am and had to call again for someone to pick up our washing. Someone arrived and advised that the bag of washing would cost a substantial amount, to which I replied no it is complimentary. She very bluntly advised there is no such thing and this bag would cost a lot to have washed. I asked for the bag back and proceeded to call a manager. The manager I spoke to was extremely rude, kept talking over the top of me and challenged me to come downstairs to have ""this conversation"" with him face to face. After being extremely frustrated and shocked with the disgusting treatment we have had to endure over the 3 days of our 4 night stay, I hung up and was in tears for the rest of the day. When we returned that afternoon, a fridge had been delivered to our room (completely too late) and the pump the conditioner bottle was jammed so we couldn't use it. By this point, we had had enough communicating with the staff at this hotel, so decided not to even bother asking for it to be fixed.Upon check out, the only staff member who actually treated us with some-what respect, Nancy checked us out and could probably sense that we were seriously not happy. By this point I was drained, as the entire experience had really affected my trip. She said sorry for our experience, by that point I just wanted to get out of there.We were on a trip with approximately 10 other people, and ended up spending time at the Novatel Hotel at Time Square. We didnt spend any time in their rooms, however they have a roof top bar with the most amazing view of Time Square. After all, thats the whole reason why we came to New York and booked with this hotel for that view, so next time we will be staying there instead.","Adelaide, Australia","214ash</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",5,1.0

I got a good deal so I decided to let it pass that I was in line to get checked in for at least a half hour. The rooms are a great size but you can tell they havent been maintained. The bathtub was a bit broken and some outlets didnt work. I had some packages delivered and couldnt belive they charge 10 usd per package and they are not even sent up to the room. I had to wait in one line and then rudely told I had to go back later because they were not on hand and then that another package was in guest services which had no one so again I waited a half hour even though at that time there was no one at the front desk waiting and someone could have helped. Another thing that surprised my was that the cleaning cart was outside my room all day long and even the night! They dont store it.

It was a nice and comfortable hotel, with a good situation. I paid a little extra for a higher floor, which was worth it I think though I was facing away from the park, so perhaps not as great a view as it could have been!The staff in the bar were very friendly and chatty and gave that 'authentic american bar tender' view you often see on TV and in films.There were a couple of things that didn't make my visit great though. There was a 'compulsory' facilities fee I had to pay, which they say covered the costs of using the fitness suite, and the business centre etc. As I had no intention of using those, I felt quite conned. Surely, if it's compulsory and everybody has to pay it then it should be included in the room rate. If not, then people should only have to pay it if they actually want to use those facilities. It just ends up making the price look more attractive to get you to book it.The front desk staff were not the friendliest. I went to the Concierge desk to ask a relatively convoluted question. After I had asked, the staff member just said, oh i'm not the concierge, I work the front desk I'm just waiting for my colleague to finish' and wandered off... Never mind...There was no restaurant which seemed a bit weird, but plenty of places to eat nearby. The $1 breakfast was acceptable, though only filter coffee, so I couldn't have decaf. I was hungry one morning and went for another croissant which cost me nearly $10...Overall, it's a nice comfortable place to rest your head.

Unfortunately, my husband and I were less than impressed. Park Central is very much a no-frills hotel, which would be fine except that they charge a $35/night resort fee that does not include anything more than what other hotels provide for free (wifi, fitness center, and business center) along with some services that might only be of value to international travelers (free local phone calls from the room). There is no bottled water in the room (free or for purchase), no pen, no note paper. No nothing. We purchased 2 beverages in the market downstairs, a Coke and a lemonade. $9! My husband walked to Duane Reade to purchase water. The room was very poorly lit and showing signs of wear. The toilet paper holder was broken and the paper was just hanging off of one working side. Instead of calling maintenance, I decided to see what would happen if I pulled the roll off so housekeeping would have no choice but to notice. Housekeeping put the roll right back on the broken holder! There was a stain on one pillow case and I took the pillow off of the bed and placed it on the floor, stain prominently showing. Housekeeping put it back on the bed! The paint on the walls was chipping and the carpet had lots of light colored stains. I did not feel comfortable taking my shoes off. Also, at all times in the day or night, if the street noise from our 11th floor room was not enough, the hallway was extremely loud, with every sound and conversation traveling into our room. For the positives: The bathroom was otherwise clean and the water pressure/temperature was good. Location was great for walking and also convenient to several subway lines.

The staff are exceptional from the front door to the concierge to housekeeping and maintenance staff. Two suggestions for the hotel. I was with a group staying there, and we all liked the hotel but commented on the poorly positioned lighting in the bathrooms which makes it difficult to see for shaving or makeup application. Lights over or beside the mirror are needed. An extension mirror with a lighted frame would be an inexpensive interim solution. There are no refrigerated mini-bars in the rooms to keep medications, etc. The $75 per day cost to rent a small refrigerator was prohibitive, and the ice buckets were poor insulators. Fortunately the staff found a way to freeze the cold pack for me for the next leg of my trip.

After reading some mixed reviews, mainly centred around the extra charges, I was a little worried about the bill but I needn't have been. we paid up front through the site and it was confirmed on there that the extra charges (tax etc) were included, but it's always a worry when you read other people saying that they had a bill pushed under their door on the last night. Yes, we did received the bill this way but it was for $0 so was very happy! There is also free wifi included, which was excellent and they also have macs down in the reception with a printer so you can go and use those for free too. This was helpful for printing out our boarding passes for the return flight. The room was immaculate and such a great view (12th floor, room 1209) and the maid kept it lovely and clean for us throughout the stay. There is also a free safe. There was no restaurant, but this didn't matter as there were far too many to choose from in the city. The bar area and lobby was always immaculately presented and very swanky. The lifts are key card activated, so you put your room card/key in the slot and you can then choose your floor. This is great, as it makes you feel secure but to be honest as there is always someone in the lift you could inadvertently pick up a hitch hiker :( There isn't really anyone ""on watch"". The lobby toilets are also a little disappointing, as there are only three and there was such a queue for them on our last day (we'd already checked out and handed our key back and needed a key for accessing them). The luggage room is available if you have a later flight, which is handy.","Knowle, Solihull, United Kingdom","Chelle W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Knowle, Solihull, United Kingdom</strong>",54,5.0

But the overall experience in the hotel gets sunken down by the lack of service. When we arrived to the entrance (with 3 large bags!), the bellboy, who is supposed to help unload the luggage from the car and take it to the lobby, did not do anything besides opening the door, or offering a carriage for taking said luggage upstairs to our room. The girl in the reception wasn't anything out of the ordinary when referring to her hospitality and welcome, and when our A/C stopped working, we had to call 3 times so that someone would come fix it.

However... the NOISE! The rooms seriously need white noise generators which I've seen in other NY hotels to drown out the outside noise. The hotel is in a very busy area, right next to central park and the Carnegie hall, 5-10 minute walk from Times square. 7th Avenue is a gridlock of traffic 24/7, so outside, day and night is honking horns, shouting and general city noise which is frequently loud enough to disturb sleep. The walls are super thin too so you can have a chat to your next door neighbour should you wish to. This is especially delightful when someone arrives from a different time zone at 3am and has a little welcome party in their room with their friends. (yes, this IS British sarcasm)For such a lovely hotel I was surprised by the lack of mini bar, fridge and coffee maker in the room, also by the lack of white noise option and very limited lifts for such a large hotel. A small single cup coffee machine was supplied on request though.The bed was seriously THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and as someone who suffers with back pain and almost never finds a comfortable bed this is really saying something. I booked a twin room for my son and I, and we were given a good sized double queen room which looked out over the side street.Overall - It has its faults, but for location versus price I think this hotel is unbeatable.

The size of the room is good enough for 3-4 persons and at most 1 extra large luggage & 1 carry-on luggage. Needless to say, the room is too small if you're travelling with more persons or bags other than what I've mentioned. Although the size of the bed is large enough to fit two persons comfortably, there just isn't enough space in the room to move around in and place more bags in the room. However, the size of the hotel room is typical for a hotel in Manhattan so it was all right.The bed was particularly comfortable and made for a good night's sleep after walking the whole day. The water pressure in the shower and sink was also excellent, and there were no issues with the water heater. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided by the hotel were likewise wonderful to use. The hotel's location couldn't be better as it is right in the middle of Manhattan and just a couple of blocks away from Central Park, Times Square, etc.Just one other thing to note aside from the tiny room is the fact that only 2 elevators service the whole hotel so expect to wait 5-10 minutes to get an elevator at peak times. For some reason, the other two elevators are not in service. Also, the mandatory $30 facilities fee per day includes fast wifi in the room and lobby, unlimited use of the gym, unlimited telephone calls, and bag storage until 9 PM.Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely choose to stay here again!","Quezon City, Philippines","Patxi_W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Quezon City, Philippines</strong>",8,4.0

I booked it and I have to say, I was a bit scared! I even brought my own towels because one review said they didn't have enough. However, my experience was really great. The hotel rooms were large for NYC standard. I had a room with a King Size bed. I had a ton of towels in the room. I also read that the maid service was lacking. I was on the 8th floor and my cleaning team did a great job on my room. The shower was powerful with lots of hot water. So, let me just call out a few things that are just realizes of the hotel. No coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks like ten feet from the front door of the hotel. Also, the elevators are historic, meaning they are not large and it doesn't make much to fill them, and there is a short wait during peak times. I would say my excellent hotel rate and all the pro's outweigh the cons. You have to decide for yourself if coffee makers and the elevator warrant you wanting to pay $$$ more. The location, again is wonderful to Central Park. I found the staff to be nice. The front desk experience i had was efficient, meaning not a lot of casual chat but who wants that, I just wanted to get my room keys and move along. lolI would gladly go back and I would encourage those who want a great bed, clean rooms, great location to try the Park Central Hotel.","Northville, Michigan","dwferrick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northville, Michigan</strong>",4,4.0

I had booked a hotel room for Friday the 23rd so we had a room ready when we touched down in the city. I had specifically asked to notate my account saying we were coming in at 6am. We arrived to the hotel only to receive a somewhat cold Good Morning. I chalked it up to being in the city and it was early. I gave the desk clerk my information and she asked us to give her a minute. She walked away and got the manager. The manager proceeded to tell me that my hotel room wasn't ready because I was a ""no show"" on Friday for checkin and that there were no notes stating that I would arrive on Saturday at 6am. I told the manager that this was totally unacceptable!! Why would I purchase a hotel Friday then???!!! Duh! The manager said she could put us in a temporary King room until my double queen room was ready and comp us for 3 days of breakfasts. Mind you there were three of us traveling. We went to the king room this is what we saw:-small doorway to bring in luggage- king bed took up the entire room barely could walk around it-no wash cloths -room was very warmThe desk clerk told us someone would call my cellphone when the room was ready. I didn't receive a call however someone called and left a vm on the hotel room that I couldn't even check. I tried calling the front desk and it went to their sister hotel. At this point I was very upset. We finally got our double room and was upgraded to a ""premier"" floor. Don't let the name premier fool you there is nothing premier about it. We were assigned a room on the 12th floor right off the elevator facing the brick buildings behind us! Wow what an upgrade! Here are the pros and cons of this place:Pros:- 2 blocks west of the Central Park- 4 blocks from the heart of time square- tons of souvenir shops- 2 blocks west of the famous Brooklyn diner- 3 blocks from the big bus city tour stop- next door to two coffee shops including Starbucks Cons- rooms are extremely small even premier upgrades- service is poor- no hotel restaurant bar only- market is tiny and very expensive- rooms are hot and uncomfortable - elevators are super slow- restrooms on main floor need a room key only- room keys lose magnetic strip easily had to get new keys multiple times - facilities fees are $31 a day on top of your room rate and triple tax you payAll in all I probably would get a hotel that is in the same vicinity as this one but would spring for something comparable in price to get more service and a better experience.","Seattle, Washington","dcstephens</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",1,2.0

The location of this hotel is fantastic!! It is close (literally like 3 blocks North) to Times Square but without the hubbub and noise. It's also walking distance to just about all the tourist spots in the city (with the exception of Lower Manhattan). Proximity to the subway (to reach Brooklyn and lower Manhattan) was also fantastic. We had no problem getting around.We had stayed in a different NYC chain hotel on a previous trip and this hotel far exceeded my expectations.Our room was large. Like, not ""large for NYC,"" but actually large. There was a sitting area by the window that had plenty of room for both of us and all our copious luggage. We had a full closet and a bathroom with more than enough space for both of us.Our view was alright. We didn't pay for a view upgrade and I was still satisfied with the view we had outside our window. We were facing Carnegie Hall.Everything was very clean and we appreciated all the space. I was not expecting our room to be so lavish for the price we paid. The sheets and pillows were modern and cozy.My only complaint is that the elevators are slow and small. I don't believe we waited for too long to catch an elevator but if I had any complaints at all it would be the elevators. Pretty minor if you ask me.

Upon reading some of the previous reviews I did wonder if I was in the same hotel! I found it clean with helpful staff when needed, saying that we did only use the hotel as a base as we were out from late morning to evening doing things all over this amazing city. One downfall we did encounter was the darkness of the rooms, especially the lack of light in the closet space, I had to use the torch button on my mobile phone to see which numbers I was pressing on the safe! We had a room on the 18th floor at the rear, away from the street noise which was ideal. We did ask for the use of a coffee machine on our second day, which duly arrived ten minutes later with a supply of coffee, which wasn't too bad either. We purchased our breakfast from the coffee and snack bar in the lobby most mornings, ideal for a very tasty muffin, fruit and coffee before heading out to do battle on the busy streets, not cheap though, about twice as much for the same at the Starbucks two doors down the avenue, but a much nicer place than the cramped Starbucks if you ate it in the lounge area!We only used the bar once, let's just say it wasn't the cheapest two beers we had in the city, but you're in New York, so it was no surprise to be honest.The luggage storage facility in the lobby on our last day was a godsend as we weren't flying till 10pm, so we were able to check out then go out for the day and come back to use the toilets and change before being picked up by our shuttle driver at 5.30pm, beware..the shuttle drivers we had came from the loony school of driving!Overall, I'd happily come back here, ideally located for all the midtown sights, a five minute stroll up to Central Park, a ten minute walk across to Fifth Avenue and another ten minutes walk down to Times Square. Staff were always amiable whenever we spoke to them, the staff on the 18th always said a friendly good morning as we headed out every morning.","Chesterfield, United Kingdom","DiverAsh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chesterfield, United Kingdom</strong>",33,4.0

Finally convinced them to check and there it was. The three nights we stayed there were fully booked. The elevators were a nightmare: Absolutely unable to handle the volume of guests and too small to fit many peoplewith their bags. Not to mention that they only have two of their four elevators dedicated to their guests. Plus you have to use your key to get the elevator to work, which is an added aggravation. The room itself is small. It has two full beds and just enough room to walk around them but no more. There's no view.

We have a view of the air- conditioning hardware and brick interior of buildings. I'm sure if you asked for a city view, you could get one.This hotel is very convenient-- we are going to Jazz at Lincoln Center, near Central Park. Only about 2 blocks from the park, 8 short blocks to Times Square and the Broadway shows.

Fantastic deal. When I checked in they told me they had no more King rooms available, which is what I booked. The lady at check in said she'd upgrade me to a better room, and comp the $31 resort daily fee for internet/gym/etc. Fine by me. I was given room 426 (I think) and when I got there the A/C wasn't working despite being set to 67 degrees. It was hot. The room also had one window that faced the interior brick corridor, and the bathroom was the size of an airplane toilet. Seriously, if you stood in the shower you would bump into the walls. I asked for another room and was promptly given 1628. Same interior corridor view, but the bath was 3x the size and most importantly - the A/C worked great. Had small issue where the sliding ""barn"" door to the closet was only hanging on with one wheel (the other was in the closet on the safe) and also the conditioner pump in the bath was not working. I called maintenance and they fixed the door while I was at work, and left me 3 bottles (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner) for the bath. I didn't need all that, just wanted the broken pump replaced on the conditioner, but ok. Minor complaint... no small fridge in the room. I just kept filling up my teeny-tiny ice bucket for water/soda. Also couldn't connect to internet for some reason. Kept saying room # wasn't correct, despite double checking with front desk that my room 1628 was the one listed. They connected me to their IT people off-site and they ended up linking my IP address so I would automatically sign in without even having to log in. Bed was very comfortable. Room was pretty much 2x the size I'm used to in NYC. Loved it. 15 min walk to Times Square/Broadway shows. Easily accessible to subway, cabs were always right outside too, even in rush hour. Clean rooms. Big flat panel TV, shower/bath has 3 large pumps of shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The only tiny bottle is the body lotion. Elevators were fast in comparison to other hotels in the area. There's also an adorable cafe kiosk in the lobby, as well as an Apple station where you can print boarding passes and such. 15 min free. Employees were all a joy to interact with.

The hotel was great. Location perfect. But being charged $200 for bellman gratuity was over the top. The bellman offered to help us with bringing pizzas for 100 kids (admittedly a lot!) to one of our rooms. We declined as there were plenty of us to carry them. The bellman insisted. We finally said ok, never suspecting we would be charged a ""gratuity"". My colleague tipped him to boot. They tried to pass a $200 ""handling"" charge from room to room. I disputed the charge with guest services. I found out the outcome when I received my credit card statement. ARGH. When our business office requested the folio the charge was listed as 'bellman gratuity'. That's not my idea of a gratuity!! Since then I've contacted the hotel and the ONLY response is to complete a form to have another credit card charged. I find this extremely unethical. Yes, I agree to pay hotel charges, but 1. There was no indication we would be charged for the bellman's offer of assistance. 2. When I disputed the charges their only response was to charge my credit card without notifying me. 3. The hotel has been unwilling to have a conversation. 4. Charging for a ""gratuity"" (their words, not mine). A gratuity is a gift. 5. We gave them considerable business. I don't have the total numbers of adults and families that stayed at the hotel, but it was easily over 100 rooms. Some thanks.

Also, when making my reservation I was promised a bunch of perks including a $10 Uber credit, no one has answered my inquiries on how I am supposed to receive this. Not really a huge deal to me, but I'd be very cautious of booking one of the packages that includes more expensive perks like parking or meal plans.

It's a large, older hotel, but one can tell that it has been thoughtfully updated & remodeled. We stayed 4-nites on the 11th floor, & then due to a flight cancellation after ✔️-out, stayed one more nite in the 10th floor. The rooms are modern & clean, the beds were fairly comfortable with plenty of pillows, soft sheets & duvet. The bathrooms were sparkling & well-lit with fluffy white towels (not too thick, not too thin...just right :) The shower heads were fun* with plenty of water pressure. (*a shiny rectangular ""rain-shower"") Not being a morning-person, I totally appreciated having the extra ceiling light in the bath&shower area. That, + the shower head made for a happy-start to my day! The rooms also had PLENTY of outlets...We had 2-ipads, 2-cellphones, my personal hairdryer & flatiron, (along with the room-provided hair-dryer), etc. We were able to charge several devices @ the same time, while simultaneously using the hair-appliances. I didn't give 5-stars because there were a few minor annoyances. Even tho the rooms had been updated, the edges of the wall2wall carpeting was frayed, & didn't quite fit flush with the wall. (providing a visual of lint & dirt that conveniently fell into those open-spaces....not so cool) Also, the large ""floating"" mirror in one of our bathrooms probably needed 2b replaced....several chipped areas around the edges.. I lived all if the outlets, altho in one of the 2-rooms we stayed in, most of the outlets didn't work....(they ALL worked fine in the other room)Other than those small gripes, the location was perfectly placed between Tumes Sq, Central Park, the theatres, Rockefeller Ctr, and....a very big plus for me (as a sometimes solo female-traveler) several ""very-close-2-the-Hotel"" subway stations. One more thing: I cannot say ENOUGH good about the PCH-staff.

I was told by several friends that the concierge would happily assist with getting tickets to shows or tours, so after checking in, we went to speak with her. The only thing she was willing or able to assist with was selling us a NY Pass and sending us to an obscure place to purchase ""left over"" cheap Broadway show tickets. After getting up to the room and pulling back the sheets to the bed, we were shocked to see stains on the bed sheets! The first phone call to housekeeping said it would take 45 minutes to change them. I then called the front desk and told them this was unacceptable and I wanted it done now. After an hour the sheets where still not changed and I asked to speak with a manager and was denied because they were in the process of taking care of my problem and doing their best. The next day I noticed something gross on the inside of the shower curtain and asked for that to be changed as well...3 days later, it was changed for a shower curtain that wasn't long enough and it barely grazed the top of the bath tub allowing water to fall into the floor when you showered. Again I was denied when asking to speak with a manager. When I booked the room and a phone call made the day before our arrival, I notified them that our anniversary was at the end of the week and I wanted something special in our room to surprise my husband. I was assured they would ""take care of it"". As you can guess by now, there was NOTHING special...AT ALL! The LEAST they could have done was to leave some mints on the pillow with a special note like ""Happy Anniversary!""...Again, disappointed.This hotel is not worth the money they charge. There are too many hotels in the city to waste time with this ""4 Star"" hotel that only deserves 2 stars at best.Good things about this hotel are that it's close to Times Square, Central Park and the Subway and it's a place to lay your head at night. The elevators are slow and small, barely room to get your luggage on.
