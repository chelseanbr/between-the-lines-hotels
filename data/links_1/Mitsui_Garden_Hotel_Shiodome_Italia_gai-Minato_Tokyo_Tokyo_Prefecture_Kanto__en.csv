We've been in Japan for a week before Tokyo, staying in Kyoto and Osaka, we were used with the size of the rooms and the japanese food for breakfast and we didn't have any problems there. We booked a massage thinking that they must have a kind of spa in house, they didn't mention while booking at the reception that the masseurs will come to the room and give the massage while climbing in your bed. Not to mention the quality of the massage... while a day before we had somewhere else the best massages ever, at the hotel we had the worst! They should fire those masseurs! At 10 PM, instead of feeling relaxed, we were angry that we couldn't communicate with the masseurs and later with no one at the reception when we asked for new bedsheets because the masseurs not only the put their feet in the bed were we put our faces, but they threw the pillows on the floor.

We turn off the heater and use the aircon to lower the room temperature to around 20 degrees for a good sleep.But in this particular hotel you can only use the heater in wintertime. You can turn off the heater but the aircon is not available during winter. The window can be opened to cool down the room but it only opens a little, and does not let much air in, and there is too much outside traffic noise to sleep. So the room is either too warm or too noisy for a good sleep.Apart from the room temperature the hotel is excellent. The service is outstanding, the room is spotlessly clean, the location very convenient, especially for Haneda Airport and there are plenty of dining options in the area. I would stay again, but perhaps phone ahead to ask them to turn off the room heating before I arrive.","Adelaide, Australia","slgc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",33,4.0

The subway is walking within 10-15 mins either way shiodome or hammamatsucho station if you dont mind. The room itself is just decent enough for japanese hotel ard 18-20m.

The plus point of this hotel is that they have triple room (not a double room with 1 extra bed), which is perfect if you are traveling in a group of 3. Another positive aspect of this hotel is the availability of onsen (Japanese public bath) at the top floor.

Location is convenient, just 5-10mins walk from the subway stop ""Hamamatsucho"", which includes not only a metro stop, but also a stop on the direct skyrail to Haneda Airport. The staff are also friendly.HOWEVER...1. THE RIDICULOUS HEAT. This hotel was so unbearably uncomfortable to stay-in. No air-conditioning (due to a stupid central policy), with an explanation to just open a window - that then gives you the benefit of hearing trains run nearby.2. UNHELPFUL RESTAURANT 'ASSISTANCE'. I wanted to book a couple of restaurants during my stay, and given the language barrier, every other Japanese hotel I have ever stayed with is helpful in this regard. Not here though. They refuse to assist with any booking for a day upon which you arrive, or depart. So that dinner on my first night was only arranged through a long bumbling phone conversation in broken English and Japanese between myself and restaurant directly... with no assistance from the hotel. Luckily I was able to get the booking, but quite a nuisance.3. REQUEST CARD DETAILS. For the restaurant the hotel did book, they requested and received my credit card details on numerous occasions to secure the booking. I created a fuss after the 2nd time they requested them - just a pure waste of my time.4. MISTREATING MY BAGS. I arrived at 2:15pm, some 45 minutes before check-in opened. The hotel performed most of the actions, and said they will store my bags then take them to the room ready for my return after dinner at 10pm (when I could pick-up the room key). At my return to the hotel at 10pm, I was disgusted to see the bags had just sat in the hotel lobby for 8 hours, and nothing was prepared for me to go to.This is not an exhaustive list, but for a simple 2 nights stay I think I have said enough >/",London,"Resident_World</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",18,1.0

And this was in March! The staff suggested I open a window, and no less than 3 different printed sheets of paper also suggested this (which indicates this is a common, if not constant issue with guests) I opened a window, and discovered just how close the train lines are to the hotel. And also, an emergency vehicle station as well, is across the street. So there were very close trains, and very loud sirens going off all night long. When I asked the staff to turn on air conditioning for the room, I was offered a desk fan. The reviews online addressing this situation, have had many replies from the hotel management suggesting that if requested, the AC can be turned on for specific rooms as needed, and all the guest had to do would be to ask. This was not at all my experience, as I argued and pleaded with the front desk staff for the AC to get turned on, and I was refused repeatedly in no uncertain terms. The reality is that the hotel management, or staff, or both, are aware that their guests are uncomfortable in their hotel, and are still more interested in saving money, than in providing the basic attributes of any modern hotel, which are specifically offered by their hotel on all of the booking sites. So essentially, they lie to get you to book a room, and when you arrive, they refuse to provide basic services as advertised, and then when guests write negative reviews, they commonly go online and lie about whether they would have provided that service if only the guest had asked. If you don't provide air conditioning, and build a hotel near train tracks, and literally refuse to turn on the AC, guests should be made aware before staying at your hotel, plain and simple. After a night of lying awake listening to loud noise, I just booked another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Tokyo, and left. I prepaid, so I was out my $600, but at least I found a hotel that was comfortable enough to actually sleep in it, and enjoy my vacation, which is not a lot to ask really.",,JasonE2146,2,1.0

The choices of european-style food were not so many (some croissants, bread, bacon and eggs) and as most of the customers are asian, I guess that is what you get. The staff speaks poor english, although they try hard to help as much as possible.The location is somewhat convenient as you are close to Ginza and 10 minute walk to two JR/metro stations.Wouldn’t recommend for someone used to European/american standards.","Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","borjasamso</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong>",44,3.0

It was a hit. Location: a bit of a walk from the Hammamatsucho station. It's a level path on the street, but the station entrance at the nearest street to the hotel has stairs. If you walk down the ""alley"" right of the station, about 1/2-way to the end of the building, and on the RIGHT, there's an elevator. Do take the time to find the hotel on the map, and locate the subway station, and get an idea of how to proceed. You can't see the hotel from the station. GPS via smartphone helps!The hotel is located in what some have called Tokyo's Italian Quarter. There are Italian themed restaurants nearby, and even the hotel's restaurant is Italian, although it's a buffet. There's a Lawson's combini in the adjacent building. Very handy.Because of the 2020 Olympics, there is a large construction project on the next block, and there is some construction noise that leaks into the rooms. It's not a factor for us, but if you're a light sleeper, it may be. The hotel is upfront about the noise.The rooms were comfy and spacious. Beds were comfortable, but the pillows are a buckwheet/conventional hybrid, so you might want your own. Bathroom has a tub/shower, and a washlet toilet. There's a desk, a hotel provided cellphone/device charger, and sufficient power connections. Wifi reaches the room.On the 13th floor, there are men's and women's spas, and a single washer/dryer machine in each spa. These are single-unit combo machines, clothes go in dirty and come out clean and quasi-dry. The downside is the machines are slow (about a 2-hour cycle). I don't recall the cost, bring 100-yen coins. Detergent is provided. You'll probably need at least one extra dry-only cycle. They also have a laundry service if DIY isn't your style.There are many restaurants and bars along the streets from the subway station. Byron Bay coffee is on the way to the station, and that became our morning coffee stop. Great coffee drinks there. Tokyo is huge, and I confess to never eating at any of the restaurants near the hotel.The hotel staff is conversant in English, and very helpful.

It is a 5-10min walk (with luggage, less without) from Daimon station, which has very good and very reasonable pubs/restaurants. It is a 5min walk from Shiodome, which is slightly more upscale but still has very good and very reasonable restaurants. It is 15min walk from Ginza (Tokyo's 'Manhattan', as it were). You won't find a better deal at a better hotel any closer to Ginza. Plus, you get the benefit of three distinct locations from this hotel.- The hotel is lovely, very well-maintained, with friendly, approachable, helpful, and multilingual staff.- The room was very nice, large for a central Tokyo hotel, and equipped with all amenities you'd expect from a hotel of this kind, and includes Nespresso machine, with complimentary tabs, WiFi, Bluetooth speaker system, television, safe, wardrobe. The bathroom was slightly small, but unless you're 6'3""+ and well-built, it's no issue. Great shower. We had a non-smoking room, though smoking rooms are available.- The breakfast has a great range but goes a little bit awry with its flavours for western visitors. A better option is to use your breakfast vouchers for lunch service, which is more conventional (if you prefer Western food - otherwise, the Japanese selection was excellent). The range of desserts is exceptional.- There is a very good convenience store next door (a Lawson Natural, open 24 hours), an outdoor pizzeria on the other corner of the square, and a very well-equipped supermarket next to that.- The area is quiet and very well-maintained. It has the layout and plan of a European square, with the hotel on one corner of the square. It's very nice and adds to the appeal of the hotel.- There is a traditional Japanese spa, free to use for guests, which is a great bonus and adds something different to the appeal of this hotel.","London, United Kingdom","ah-m_ldn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",9,5.0

The staff were very friendly and helpful, and were more than happy to look after our luggage before check-in and after check-out. We didn't stay long enough to make use of any facilities (which is a shame because they looked good), so all I can rate is the room itself. Unfortunately, it was not good. We booked a triple room (3 adults), but the room was barely big enough to fit the three beds. There was no room whatsoever for our suitcases. We had to keep them zipped up and standing vertically against the wall at the foot of our beds and could then just get through without climbing over the beds. It looked like a third bed had been squeezed into a small double room, rather than being a true triple room. We were glad we were only staying one night. The wardrobe was barely big enough for two, let alone three, but we were not unpacking so this didn't bother us too much. The toilet was in the same room as the shower, making the morning routine a slower process for three of us.The hotel is easy walking distance from both the subway (Daimon) and JR (Hamamatsucho) stations and we had no trouble wheeling our luggage to and from. The hotel itself may have been fine if we'd booked two rooms, but it is definitely not suitable for three in one room.

Our 3rd Tokyo visit in 5 years and still can’t think of a better place to stay 2) We love walking in Tokyo, regardless of temperature & weather. 3) We did not stay in the basic room. We stayed in the superior double which came with its own Nespresso coffee machine, which made a whole world of difference as you would see later in the review.Mitsui Garden is located in the Hamamatsucho/Shinbashi vicinity. It is a quiet, charming part of Tokyo, apparently with some Italian connections, and hence its name. Location-wise, it’s perfect for us! True that it’s not really near any subway/JR train stations. Google Map puts it at 600-700m away from Hamamatsucho station, which is about 5-6 min walk away. Even with our luggage (albeit only one piece), it’s pretty manageable. There are a number of charming hole-in-the-wall eateries and cafes along the way to cater to all whims and fancies. We had lunch at one of the stand-up udon stalls. Fantastic food. In the other direction, it’s about 10-15 minutes’ walk from Shinbashi with its endless variety of eateries, watering holes and izakayas. This distance can get to some stopover guests but for us, it’s a big plus as it allows us to walk off our dinner/drinks (see caveat above) and put a physical distance between the Shinbashi crowds/bedlam and us.The room was a decent size for a Tokyo hotel, in fact a bit on the generous side. Our room came with a Nespresso machine and 4 capsules which were topped up daily. The average temperature in the mornings during our 4-day stay was 1 degree Celsius. The Nespresso saved our lives by giving us our daily coffee fix in the comfort of our own room. We could buy in some simple bites from the Lawson next door for a quick breakfast. It also boasted of a Sony Bluetooth speaker which allowed us to play our favourite tunes in a foreign room. Awesome! The pillows were a bit flat and hard and not very comfortable for both of us. As mentioned by some reviewers, it did get a bit noisy when some of the more inconsiderate guests returned to their rooms. Didn’t really get out of hand though, just a bit annoying.Staff spoke good English and generally very helpful. We were going to Hakushu Whisky Distillery and my wife emailed them to assist with a reservation at the White Terrace restaurant. Reply email came on the same day with the reservation made.In short, we have found our default go to Tokyo hotel. The price-value proposition and the whole package works really well for us. We are more than won over by the nice touches that the hotel offer for a reasonable price. Everyone has his/her own favourite area in Tokyo and Shinbashi/Hamammatsucho is not for everyone. But if you are looking for a more than decent room here at a good price, look no further than Mitsui Garden Shiodome.Tips: 1) A cab ride from the hotel to Tokyo Monorail at Hamamatsucho is 410 yen, which is the flag down fare. We were leaving at 6 am and decided not to wake the neighbourhood with our luggage.2) A couple of eateries worth trying are Akitaya 秋田屋 at Hamamatsucho, Rose and Crown pubs. There are a number of them scattered around Shinbashi, Yaesu, Tokyo station area. The steak roast went perfect with Suntory's Master Brew, especially in a chilly spring night.","Singapore, Singapore","Hwee Chong C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",127,5.0

We finally checked in at 12 noon and had to pay and extra 3000 yen for ""early check in"". Other than that, this was a good choice. Room was rather small but not oppressively so, the double bed was somewhat larger than expected, nice comfortable beddings, shower was good, deep bathtub, electric kettle, little fridge and safe in room. And quite importantly, free wifi was quite fast. Building's not very tall so not much of a view from any room, but higher would be better as you'd get more light, we had room 1023 which was fine. And this being Japan everything's exceedingly clean. About the area, it's in a quiet new development, all new European style buildings, and the street the hotel was not named ""Italia-gai (Italian street) for nothing. Quite a few restaurants and coffee shops around, in fact the most concentration of western restaurants compared to any other neighborhood in Tokyo. A 10-15 minute walk will bring you to either the busy area of Shimbashi with tiny traditional Japanese restaurants under the train tracks or malls with newer restaurants and shops, and in 20 minutes you would reach Ginza. So while the hotel is not right in the middle of everything it's certainly close enough. There is also a convenience store Lawson's right next to the hotel for drinks and snacks - try the egg custards they were delicious!The hotel itself has an Italian restaurant, serving three buffets a day. Tried the breakfast which had more Japanese dishes than western ones but try at least once it would be interesting. More than that it could get boring as nothing changed much from day to day.

Around 25 minutes walk away from the famous fish market Tsukiji fish market.There aren't a whole lot of restaurants (especially local ones) nearby so you might need to again walk a bit to grab a bite. There's a Lawson's convenience store nearby and it could probably solve most needs.I didn't try the hotel restaurant and it probably didn't warrant a try anyway.Room was spacious (for Tokyo/Japan standards) and was enough for me and my gf.Typical Japanese bathroom set (felt like it was those stock/removables) slightly small compared to the room itself, very hard for 2 people to navigate in.Shower Amenities are the big bottled sharing pump types so if you are picky in having small little sample sized bottles this may not be for you.No fancy service, but this is all you need simplicity.Overall this was great value for money.

The only person in the staff who really speaks English --a lovely girl raised in Canada-- is not in everyday.I'm still here, at the moment facing the following problems:--Noisy room facing the subway tracks (I had asked for a silent room in my reservation, to no avail);--Telephone does not work;--Exhaust vent in the bathroom extremely noisy, can't turn it off;--A/C has no temperature control, you have to choose between on or off and that's it;--No help with restaurant reservations, because nobody at front desk speaks English well enough to understand what the guests are asking.I just went down to front desk to ask for a possible room change. But gave up after a 40-minute teeth-cringing study in miscommunication. The trainee who tried to help me spoke almost no English. When I asked to see a manager, I found out that said manager has zero English skills. I just gave up.The Mitsui Garden Shiodome is a 4-star hotel that charges 4-star rates, but offers ridiculously amateurish services.

Two friends and I stayed in a well furnished room with 3 single beds. Compared to hotels in other cities in Japan, the room was reasonably spacious. I didn't go to the spa, but the hotel offers two spa areas, one for males and the other for females. Also, I didn't clock the distance from the hotel to the nearest subway or JR Station, but it seemed to be about 1/3rd of a mile (or 0.5 km). If you don't speak Japanese, but are fluent or proficient in English, language barriers should not be an issue. The employee who handled our check-in spoke fluent English. The other employees with whom I interacted didn't appear to speak fluent English, but certainly spoke English well enough to help me. If you're from a primarily English speaking nation, I realize that you may desire a hotel at which all employees speak fluent English. However, the employees of this hotel were the most fluent or proficient compared to the other 5 hotels at which we stayed in Japan, with the exception of one hotel that is specifically geared towards U.S.A. residents. The hotel is located in what appears to be a relative new or revitalized area, and contains European style buildings. It felt very nice and safe. Among other restaurants, there was a reasonably-priced curry restaurant nearby. There was also a Lawson Natural store, which I'm guessing is an upscale brand of Lawson convenience stores. Nightlife is somewhat non-existent around this hotel. However, I was OK with that. If you want nightlife, you can easily take transit to another area of the city, such as Rippongi, then come back to the hotel for sleep. I will note that taxi, whether it be Uber or a regular city cab, may be your best option after 12:00AM-ish, as many forms of transit shut down around then.","Richmond, Virginia","middan94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",8,5.0

We were heading out of the hotel after check in because the room was not ready. When we asked if our luggage would be sent to the room when it is ready because we would be back late at night to collect the room keys, the staff replied maybe. What is the meaning of ""maybe""?

We stayed at the Mitsui Garden Shiodome Italia-Gai hotel which is within walking distance (5mins) of Hamamastu-Cho Station which has a direct monorail line to Haneda Airport. Close to Ginza and Tokyo station and on the Yamanote JR line that circles Tokyo, giving you easy access to the likes of Shibuya, Harajuku and Shinkjuku.The hotel itself was new and in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. Reception staff were friendly and spoke good English. Rooms were 20m² which for Japanese standards and for the price was not too bad. There were plenty of much much smaller rooms on offer on other sited for 2 or 3 times the price.We didn't use the restaurant in the hotel but it was an Italian Restaurant (matching the feeling of the surrounding area) that had Breakfast and then offered an all you could eat buffet for lunch and dinner for a decent price. The communal bath house on the top floor is an absolute winner!!!!Free Wi-fi in the rooms however service was sporadic.Great location and a nice clean hotel.

The lobby and breakfast area are small, and the rooms are tiny and pretty basic.We stayed here, due to last minute travel plans. The location, though not too far from the metro station and JR stations (8-10 min walk), is not entirely ideal as the hotel is located in a very quiet back street, filled with small offices and a few restaurants. There isn't much to do or see within that area. We thought the check-in process was very slow, until our check-out experience! I am not sure of the payment mode my husband used (maybe it was prepared by his company), but the front-desk did not give us a payment receipt upon checking out. My husband asked for a bill print-out. The front desk staff struggled with the request for almost 10 min. We got tired of waiting and told her to just forget about it, as we were in a hurry to catch a train. She then asked her colleague for help, which he did so, effortlessly. I supposed she must have been a new staff, but I can't understand why she can be so poorly trained. Isn't bill printing a pretty standard process for front-desk staff to handle?During one of the days, we asked for direction to Chidorigafuchi, and to my surprised, the staff (a different staff) took quite a long while (maybe 10 min or so) to do his research and give us the information. Chidorigafuchi happens to be among the top 3 sakura viewing spots in Tokyo during spring season, and we were there during the peak of the sakura season. I had expected him (the hotel) to have such information at his fingertips. Another issue I had with the hotel is their pillows - ie. the traditional Japanese pillow (I think it was filled with buckwheat). Maybe this doesn't bother other hotel guests but I found it to be extremely small, hard and uncomfortable. As a result I slept very poorly throughout my 2 nights stay there.

It was under $10 per day and kept us connected everywhere, even in the metro. It really helped us navigate the city. The hotel is new, clean and modern. Quiet rooms and comfortable beds. There is currently construction going on across the street, but we were out all day and didn't hear anything when in the room. Nice toiletries provided. Mini fridge in each room and complimentary bottled water each day. We ate in the restaurant the first day. Huge buffet was good, but preferred a smaller breakfast the following days at the nearby Pronto Cafe. The staff was very helpful in providing directions and maps. Our only complaint was that we couldn't get cooling in our room. We turned off the heat and opened the window for air. The Hamarikyu Garden is a five minute walk and the Tsukiji Fish Market is ten min. past the garden. The Shimbashi area has lots of great restaurants for dinner, tiny places, narrow alleys, a true local experience. The two main metro stations that we used were Daimon and Shimbashi.

This is a step up from the business hotel chain Keio Presso. The beds are softer, room has a coffee maker, mini-fridge, hair dryer and in-room pants press. We had a double room which had enough room to store two bags, a desk with chair plus lounge chair and a small closet for about 5 pieces of clothing. For business the room had free, reliable in room wi -fi and adjustable air conditioning. We could get the room cool enough to sleep. It did not lock at 68F. The bathroom size was fine - it had a tub and shower with detachable head. Towels were thin. They had basket on counter with razor, toothbrush, etc in case you forgot. The hotel buffet did not look good and it was expensive so we skipped it. Elevators were fast - ours has three. They held our luggage on day of checkout. The location was easily walkable (about 8 min) to Hamatsucho or Shimbashi station (both on Yamanote JR line). Also Daimon subway station was right next to Hamatsucho. Shiodome is a new neighborhood so it doesn't have a lot of charm but the location was convenient and much quieter than Shibuya or Shinjuku for example. There are a lot of food options by the stations. Family Mart around the corner and a Pronto coffee a few blocks away as well. My two negatives were the pillows (like a thin rock) and second that I booked with otel.com. I got a good rate but I could not choose non-smoking and in Tokyo that is a major problem because almost all hotels are still half and half so we were on a smoking floor and the room smelled like an ashtray. Beware. Otherwise I would recommend this as a good business hotel option in Tokyo at the right price.

I thought I had scored a real bargain. Different booking sites showed very different prices for the ""Mitsui Garden Hotel"" in Tokyo. On the map both seemed to be in the same place, yet the prices varied wildely. So I was eager to book via the cheaper site, ready to enjoy some luxury and feel smug for having paid so little.Now that I'm actually in the hotel I understand. ""Mitsui Garden"" is a chain of hotels. They have one hotel in Shiodome, which is on the edge of the ""Ginza"" area. There's another Mitsu Garden hotel mere minutes away actually in Ginza. The latter is seriously expensive, the hotel in Shiodome is of average price.The Mitsu Garden of Shiodome is located in a neighbourhood with houses in European style. The pharse ""little Italy"" would overdo it, but there are several Italian restaurants, an Italian supermarket and some Italian themed shops here. The Mitsui Hotel doesn't have a restaurant of its own, but on the base floor (connected to the central lobby) is a buffet restaurant. And yes, it is Italian style. For those not so keen on a daily dose of cheese, pizza and olive oil there's a ""Natural Lawson"" supermarket next door. Very convenient!A walk to Ginza mainstreet takes about ten to fiveteen minutes. Mitsui Garden Shiodome is located between Shiodome stationa and Daimon station (the latter is also known as Hamamatsucho). Both require a 5 minute walk. That's not so bad every day, but when you have heavy luggage or in bad weather a hotel right on top of a station might be more convenient.While this Mitsui Garden isn't very luxurious, it doos look new, clean and stylish. The designers managed to set an elegant, modern theme which continues in the room. The room is compact, but there's enough space around the bed(s) for big suitcases. And then there's enough space for a desk and lazy chair as well. Some Tokyo hotels offer far less space for more money. Wifi and cable Internet are available for free. The connection speed is very low during the evening; in the morning and mid day speed is okay.The room is very well equiped, all basic things one expects at this price are there. Some noticeable things: the window in the room actually opens, which I found very pleasant. Every day roomservice brings two complimentary bottles of water to the room. There's a handy phone charger on the room, so one does not have to fiddle around with adapters.The cons: be aware that beds in Japan are generally hard and the beds in the Mitsui Hotel are even harder than average in Japan. The cushions seem to be filled with balls, seeds or something like that and are very uncomfortable. The air circilation in the bathroom is always on and can be pretty noisy. The room key is a paper (!) card and the staff urged me not to bend or fold it. The staff does speak English, or at least gives it a try. Do mind that this hotel is a little off centre, so the level of understaning English may leave something to be desired. So while this hotel wasn't a steal at this price, it did feel very Italian to me.","Tokyo, Japan","i0kan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",291,3.0

We found it was easier to access this hotel from the JR shimbashi station (10 minutes walk) as most trains leave from there. Whilst the shiodome station is a little closer it is not a major station and you will need to change trains straight away at the next station most times. Upon arrival go to a JR station and buy a Suica card which will give you access to all the transport in Tokyo. Be wary as some train passes only allow access to some train lines. We found that when we had luggage or tired at the end of the day exploring Tokyo it was easier to get a taxi back to the hotel approx 710y. Hotel is in a quieter neighbourhood away from the hassle and bustle.

The best part of the hotel is the public spa bath on the top floor opened till midnight. Japanese style, letting you relax after a busy day in Tokyo. Beds are very comfortable.Three bed room is same size as two beds room, so it is too squeeze. And though it is a non smoking room, it often have a smoking smell at night.

For those bath lovers,like me, cannot stand the usual bath tub in rooms, this is the hotel to come; there is a big bath on the top floor for you to stretch your legs in a big bath to relax! It also has a self-service laundry machine in the public bath area for you to wash your clothes if necessary. I have stayed here for 5 nights during January. Though it is a bit far from station (approx 8-10 min), the hotel is still nicely served by convenience stores and a nice restaurant on the ground level. It is within walking distance from Shinbashi or Hamamatsucho station.

After one long day, you can use the large ""Ofuro"" - bath on the top floor. Italian restaurant on the ground floor offers decent food at a reasonable price but I recommend to walk near daimon station and visit the small restaurant instead. Walking distant through shiodome to ginza which is good but slightly far. If you take a taxi, taxi driver will mistaken easily to the Mitsui garden premier in ginza, so you should tell him it's next to the JRA building. Walking distance from daimon which is great if you are coming by monorail.

Obviously, their bed is not clean and which resulted in my illness. I told the clerk what happened to me right away. The sickness made me very very uncomfortable and couldn't sleep whole night. The clerk gave me some medicine bit it didn't work. She only said she's sorry. I even had to find the doctor by myself. They broke my vacation.I communicated with the hotel several times. What they did was keeping saying sorry, but they refused to admit it's their fault. They said "" It never happen before. We don't know why it happen to you."" It's too ridicious.

The rooms were excellent, the free public bath a wonderful bonus and the service was polite with staff who spoke good English. I was particlarly pleased with the hotel's location. A ten or fifteen minute walk into Ginza, there really is no need to take the subway or hire a taxi. The JR station is a 5 min walk away (with luggage), ideal if you are on a budget and have the JR rail pass. We used this all the time in Tokyo and found that we never needed the metro. The district around the Hamamatsucho Station is very well served with excellent retaurants and the fish market is within walking distance if you fancy checking it out before breakfast.The hotel restaurant is expensive and so too is the breakfast. at around 20€. Still, we tried it once and thoroughly enjoyed the range of tastes. Afterwards we settled for nearby cafés in the morning.
