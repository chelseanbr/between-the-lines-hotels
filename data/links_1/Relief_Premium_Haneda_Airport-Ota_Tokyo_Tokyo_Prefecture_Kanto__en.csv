I wanted somewhere reasonably priced within easy access to Haneda airport and this hotel was perfect. From Haneda it was a short and easy 010minute train ride (I asked the train staff and they helped with ticket and which stop). At the train stop it is a short 5 minute walk - there is a tourist information centre in the train station and if you go in there they will print you a map and the lady actually walked part of the way with me.The hotel itself is fabulous. The reception team were extremely friendly and the room was spacious (compared to others stayed in within Tokyo), extremely clean and comfortable. There were black out curtains that were so good I overslept as I thought I had woken too early! No issues at all with the hotel and actually would have stayed longer if was in Tokyo longer. In the morning I went for a run along a canal near the hotel which was very pleasant. To get back to the hotel there is a free shuttle which you have to book in advance. Alternatively it would be really easy to get a train back to the airport too. The hotel is about 15 minutes by train from Shinagawa station and another 10 minutes by train from Shinjuku. Really easy. I can't fault this hotel - only perhaps the late check in (3pm) which after a long flight in the morning is a wait (I instead took a shower at the facilities at Haneda airport before coming to the hotel).

We have stayed in other mini room places around the airport which were better designed, but this one was a little cheaper so we tried it for a change.They also have an interesting spread for breakfast which was all healthy food with good taste, but those looking for a standard international breakfast will be let down. It's so healthy there is no butter for the breads (which the breads themselves were excellent) and there were no eggs for the kids. We would kindly suggest not only have eggs for kids, but also offer kids price. We were really bummed out to have paid the full price of about $12USD for each kid who only wanted to eat rice since they're not into health foods. But for those who are interested to try Organic Vegetarian options, you might well think you died and went to heaven.We saw the reviews about the airport shuttle at the last minute and called Bcom customer service to have them book us on the airport shuttle in advance and so we got it, but I can see where with about 120 rooms and one mini van which goes every hour holding 9 passengers, some people might get left behind and have to pay the $20 taxi ride to airport in which case they'll be kicking themselves for not having booked something nicer.","Phuket, Thailand","Eric C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phuket, Thailand</strong>",51,3.0

Why I can't book the shuttle bus 8 hours before departing while 1 hour before departing the bus already fully booked? What happened with their time mangement? The front desk try to give and excuse with a very limited English speaking availability. Probably I will never going back to this hotel if I coming back to Japan. I really not recommend for travelers to stay if you have a very tight and limited schedule to the airport.",,Morison H,8,2.0

The hotel is pretty easy to find, <10 mins from the airport on the subway and a 5 min walk from the station.Given the cost we were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room. The location is obviously great for the airport, but the main nightlife spots in Tokyo (shibuya & shinjinku) are also only 40-50 mins from the hotel so definitely doable. Earlier in our trip we stayed at a more central hotel in Tokyo but ended up taking the same time to get to these areas.As others have noted the free shuttle service they put on seems a little more complicated than it could be. We booked under the expectation that we’d make our own way to the airport so this was a bonus for us. The deal is basically you can only book 30 mins before departure, and they’re restricted to only 9 people. They operate on a first come first swerved basis so it just depends on who is around at the time of the morning you want to travel as to whether you’ll get a seat.For us this wasn’t a real issue as we would have just grabbed the subway - but if you were travelling with more elderly passengers you might prefer to arrange something more definite. In this case I’m sure a taxi would be reasonable (10 min journey) esp. when considering the price of the rooms.Overall I’m giving this 5 stars as it was perfect for our needs.Just one other tip, if using google maps be sure you have the right premium relief hotel relief plugged in as there’s two almost identical hotels within a mile of each other. I managed to get the wrong hotel when travelling back for Tokyo so ended up in a 20+ min walk late at night. Not the hotels fault of course - just something to be aware of!

The hotel doesn’t run the shuttle in the afternoon/evening. And even when it runs the shuttle in the morning it only runs once every hour and only takes 8 people. (Oh and no bookings are possible, you must arrive 30mins before to claim one of those limited spots). What a ridiculous system! So the supposedly convenient hotel that is close the the airport with its shuttle is actually far from that. ",,Jeremy R,1,1.0

Its a contemporary layout with good internet, healthy brekky.The place is super clean, well organised and very convenient for the airport traveller from/to Haneda International, Tokyo and the rail system or shuttle bus service on offer.I travel the globe for work and stay in alot of hotels - this place is simple, clean and hit the mark.Would recommend a look for sure.
