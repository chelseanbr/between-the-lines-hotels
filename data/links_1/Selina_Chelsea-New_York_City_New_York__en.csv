Located right by the Highline, this hotel thrives on being different without being weird or impractical. Great use of space in the room with ample space for luggage and a reasonably sized modern bathroom.Bed is on a slightly raised platform with the mattress then resting on the floor. Those with limited mobility who need the normal clearance between floor and the top of the mattress may not like this. Otherwise great. Got a great price but could be down to time of year (late Feb).

This fee should have at least been mentioned in the confirmation email.In sum, this hotel is just ‘ok’ and quite pricey for what it is ($400-450/night with all of the taxes and fees).

Not even 3 star. It is 2 and half star. Under construction - as you enter there was the smell of solvent. I should of turned around then. But I went for the adventure of the americano - No lobby - dust. No restaurant. No place for coffee before 7am. No deli or place for amenities next door or on the street nearby. I didnt see a bar as advertised. So forget it - it isnt there. You are in the NYC trip off experience. There is a ""facility"" charge even if you dont use for wifi and luggage storage. Even tho the wifi is one of those sign in things where you swear to the allegiance of some corporate swank. You cant get a beverage in the hotel except during the breakfast time. So if you get up a 630 you are out of luck. There is no coffee in room. Or nite cap etc...The rooms are like closets. The bed is a mattress on the floor on small platform maybe 4-6 inch off ground- - so getting in and out of bed is a mobility issue- more like stop drop and roll - but i do yoga so i got my downward dog in- . And i mean it is a mattress on the floor - there is no box spring - so there is a bit of the roughing it - dorm life- No place to put your luggage - a squeeze - no hooks to put hand towels in bathroom so on the floor?. the water from my quick 2 min shower flowed into the room. the desk or i mean ""shelf"" for phone and bottle water - is barely room for a mac book pro so leave it at home - they are going more for the airlines tray size -so if you are in ""big"" business this isnt for you. so small there are no drawers for clothes -shelf in closet? that's cool but there isnt room or place to put the suitcase( and i brought a carry on) - the bathroom - lets say shower stall - the sink is so small ( how small - SMALL -) someone with large hands could only put 1 hand in the sink at a time_ there is no rack for a wash cloth or towel to hang nor door to hang on - poor design - one of those designs that the shower glass can see into the room- if you like to groom yourself and make yourself presentable such as makeup or shave or a little fluffing case or toiletries there is a small shelf about the size of a water glass with low lite and even though im tall the towels are high above the toilet - and it was a reach for me- so if you are average size they have a step stool to reach the towels. I kept thinking this place is like the puffy shirt in seinfeld kinda thing minus the laughs and i am a new yorker - also to be cute or designy they dont have a do not disturb sign but rather a black and white signage which god help me at midnite i couldnt recall if white was make up the room or do not disturb - wtf? it is advertised as a family hotel - and well i guess it is for i could hear the family next door fully all night. of course the next morning i complained and it was one of those scenarios where you arent believed and it is my problem - such as being told - well when I go to a hotel i just go to sleep - I pity the staff for having to work there- - there is one small uncomfortable metal chair - but if you have to do an email - etc.. i would work w a phone or ipad or telepathy - the robe was a turn off for it was made out of blue jean- the towels were good. But I have to give credit where credit is due and - I didnt see vermin didnt see puke and didnt see something sticky in a corner. So it could have been worse.

First off, the room was dirty, small, and not welcoming. The concrete floors looked dirty and the lights were VERY dim. The main light was not working and would just flicker whenever I tried to turn it on. The bathroom was dirty and the toilet was super high (why?) where your feet basically can't touch the floor when sitting on it. The concrete floors are cold and do not look clean. You'd think they offer you some slippers but after asking the front desk they said they ""eliminated"" all slippers recently (wtf?) and didn't have any. I basically had to wear shoes the entire time which was not comfortable. The shower took around 7-10 minutes for hot water to come out. The sink was also SUPER small and in an awkward position so whenever you're brushing your teeth or washing your face water would get everywhere on the floor. Bed was fine and comfortable. There was also no ironing board - you have to request it from the front desk. No roomcards for entry, they are actual super heavy keys that you need to lug everywhere. Save for one person, the staff was in general not that friendly and one looked like she just woke up from a nap when I asked for assistance. Lastly, everything is under construction so no access to main lobby restaurant or rooftop. The only good thing about this hotel is the location but you can probably get a higher quality and cheaper room somewhere else.","Los Angeles, California","crazylegsss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,1.0

The rooms are uncomfortable and not in good shape. For example our bathroom door was really hard to close and the handle was not attached so fell off every time we used it. The air vents were moldy. There were loose wires in the closet. Whoever cleaned the room did not take out the trash or replace our water glasses. Finally, the hotel uses keys instead of room cards. We thought our keys didn't work and staff explained you just have to jiggle them around a lot - so we had to just jiggle the keys around for like 30 seconds any time we wanted to get into our room. Seriously???The website lists amenities like Le Labo bathroom products, tablet in room, in-room minibar, luxurious bathrobes, slippers, communal spaces, room service until 11 pm ... we did not have any of these. The bath products were cheap, no tablet, no mini bar, only 1 bathrobe that was made out of DENIM (seriously?), no slippers, no communal spaces at all, the restaurant was completely closed except for breakfast. You will be charged a $25 utility fee per night yet they claim the wifi is ""complimentary."" It's not complimentary if you have to pay for it...The entire ground floor is under construction. We booked this hotel with friends so we could hang out at the hotel - that was impossible. There is no lounge or anywhere to sit. The restaurant is completely closed except for breakfast. As other reviewers have mentioned, no one told us this when we booked the hotel. Our reservation confirmation actually says the restaurant is popular and advises us to make a reservation. LOL. Also the pool and rooftop area is closed but I think this is mentioned on the website. We were informed the pool was currently closed when we booked but assured that it would almost definitely be open by the time we came. It was not. Staff was unprofessional - one night, we got back to the hotel and an employee was literally blocking the entrance and yelling at a group of people down the street. When we tried to enter, he didn't move or acknowledge us in any way so we just had to squeeze around him.The only good things I can say is that our room was pretty quiet at night and the location was nice.

It's near the water and not too far from some of the attractions (Chelsea Market, High Line). However, the hotel itself is quite basic. Rooms are small and design is cold - think concrete floors and walls. We had a hanging light next to our mattress, which I managed to hit my head on in the middle of the night trying to get up. We also had a unique situation occur. My boyfriend left a dress shirt in the closet of the room. We were already at our second hotel across town when he realized. We quadrupled checked our suitcases and the blue dress shirt he had worn the night before wasn't there. He called the hotel and was told that they did not find a blue dress shirt. After some back and forth, they said they would check with the cleaning staff in the morning and get back to us. Morning came and went and we did not receive a call. He called them later that afternoon only to be told there was no shirt. We are 100% certain the shirt was there as he had worn it to dinner the night before and hung it up right before bed. Nothing has been done as of yet, and I'm quite disappointed in the customer service we have received from the hotel.

I wanted to be close to a concert venue at Hudson yards called The Shed. With little time in the city I didnt want to waste it so with a little research I picked this hotel. Its also directly opposite a stunning building that was designed by Zaha Hadid ( This was my view) and beside the High Line so easy to go for a walk there. Theres also a great little Italian opposite for pizza which we had on our last day.Staff.Staff were quick to respond to my emails before i arrived helping with transfers and being understanding when I had to cancel them. I had booked a guaranteed upgrade which I thought meant you were upgraded to the room standard above the room you had booked ( at least this was what it implied) however this is not the case so when I went to my room i was very disappointed. At £350 for the night it was essentially a small concrete box with little view behind. I called reception who explained that the upgrade just put me on a higher flower not into the better room ( My friend did the same but ended up on the 4th floor with a view of a wall). They hung up to check and called me back to give me the biggest room in the hotel for no extra charge as they didn't think they would sell it. I was really happy that they had been so helpful but unfortunately my friend didnt have the same response. Perhaps because I was travelling with my small son, they went the extra mile, perhaps I just got luck either way the staff were kind and helpful.Le Labo toiletries. Anyone who puts these in from of me is a friend for life.Not so Good things:The rooms are a little more style over substance. Purely in my opinion and I'm sure people love them and their concrete. But I still don't know what the suspended metal fire was about in my room and I'm sure it has never been lit. It hangs over a plug socket so when we plugged in our computer or phone we'd hit our heads on it! The bed was in a large wooden box type frame which is a nice idea but after 3 days we gave up trying to turn our bedside light on, not sure if it was the bulb or the 27 switches that we were getting confused with so felt too stupid to call reception!Having said that the bed was comfortable, the rooms clean and it was pretty quiet.No one should be asked to pay 10USD for a bottle of water in their roomBreakfastSo this was an additional cost on our room.Its served at the table rather than generous buffet which s fine, selection of coffees,fresh juices, all kinds of healthy eggs. granola. Only 1 drip coffee ( there was none the first morning) and 1 dish is included in the cost. SO a cappuccino is extra, a smoothie and toast is extra, everything basically is extra. Service was friendly and helpful but very slow and things like spoons, salt, pepper, had to be asked for.Basically I'd advise you to give it a miss and head round the corner to find somewhere better. I do it because I like to roll out of bed with my son in a hotel and eat, but this probably isn't worth the extra cost. Im sure its a fraction of the price if you just pay for the dishes you want on the morning rather than pre pay.The roof bar is a central enclosed courtyard with the pool to one side ( it was closed when we were there) and a small sofa area in a corner which has an incredible view of the skyline. There is also a great view through the actual bar, but its a little strange having such a small area to see the view. Maybe I missed somethings i was only there for a moment.The bill was fairly hefty especially once city taxes etc are all added on, none of which are clearly explained on the website.Overall it was for me a great location, friendly, a little hip, pretty expensive for what you get. It is a good little spot for a night if you know what to expect so hopefully my review helps!","Donaghadee, United Kingdom","graceandnature</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Donaghadee, United Kingdom</strong>",117,3.0

Special commendation to the super efficient Katerina at the front desk, too. Rooms are NY-sized and while crawling onto the mattress was unusual, it was ridiculously comfortable, as were the pillows.

It was great for our visit to the Whitney museum - walking there on the Highline which is right at the hotel. The room has design maybe influenced by Japanese style. The bed is basically a mattress on the floor. Which was all fine for us . The mattress was of good quality and we slept well.The simplicity in the design has gone too far as there were no hooks for hanging your clothes or even towels. A closet though exists, I suppose to keep everything look “clean”. There was also an odd oven or what ever it is supposed be hanging from the ceiling. Maybe it is just a piece of art. I like design and art, but also functionality. Here this combination doesn’t quite work. Still, all is basically fine.Room temperature was high and the control for it did not have any effect.

We chose it for the location near galleries in Chelsea. Right by the Hi Line Park. Vibe is industrial chic. Small room with the mattress on the floor. Well not quite on the floor. Halfnthe floor is poured cement (no carpeting). The other half of the the floor is a 4inch high wooden platform and the bed is on that. You have to crawl to get into it. You don’t need a bedside table as you are kind of sleeping on the bedside table. The mattress was very soft and felt well-used. Sheets were pretty standard. All the light switches and plugs are on one side of the bed, so hard to access if you are on the wrong side of the bed. No USB plugs. The light in is very indirect. Hard to read in bed as no bed side lamps. One large window that faced an air shaft. Tiny desk with no plugs for a laptop and covered with the food they want you to buy. As well as an “intimacy kit.” If you need a cord to charge your phone it’s available. For $35. Hey it’s NY. Small TV on the wall but we couldn’t find the remote. And it’s 90deg angle to the bed so wouldn’t have been comfortable to watch anyways. Tiny bathroom with the smallest sink I have ever had in any hotel room ever in my life. No where to put any toiletries. No where to even hang a towel as the two small pegs are occupied by a robe and a tote bag they are trying to sell you. The toilet seat is oddly high. If you are less than 5’6” your toes will touch. The shower pressure is good from a rain head. Plenty of hot water. Reasonable quiet for a hotel in NY, but you do hear the construction in the neighborhood. AC was reasonably quiet white noise. No parking. No valet parking. No free water in the room. Room cost $575 with taxes. It was not a good value. Was more of a 250-300 experience. I won’t be returning.

The bed is on the floor, and while it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (both the mattress and bedding and pillows), it was very annoying to have to crawl out of bed. This wasn't helped by an insanely low large lamp being suspended over part of the bed, which I headbutted a few times (unintentionally).

The hotel is dog friendly, which is why we chose it - we needed to bring our 40 lb terrier on our trip to NYC with us... but, with that being said, we needed to take our dog outside several times during our 18 hours at the hotel. They give you one key fob that works the elevator, your room lock and also the lights and all power (TV, etc.) in your room. In order to leave the room, to take the dog out, I had to take the fob (or I wouldn't be able to get back up in the elevator) and leave my family in the complete dark in the room (no lights, tv, air) until I came back with the dog... not ideal whatsoever.The beds are also on the floor - mattresses on the ground (on a wooden platform that steps up from the concrete floor in the rest of the room)... the photos show this, so it's not a surprise - just something to be aware of, for those who don't want to roll out of bed to get out...

It's worth stating that this is a hotel for design enthusiasts and it will not disappoint in that regard. The details (down to the washcloths and chambray bathrobes) are really special. The location is ideal for visiting the Whitney, the Highline, Chelsea art galleries and all the cool things happening at the Mckittrick hotel. Others will write that to that effect, so I'd like to comment specifically on the staff. Both times I had an exceptionally warm check-in. The first time, I left behind a small cosmetics case but only realized it when the staff called me. I mentioned that I would return for it and they kept it stowed away safely until my next visit. They also bent over backwards to make dinner recommendations. The dining staff in the downstairs restaurant was also particularly attentive and gracious. The breakfasts are divine and it's worth splurging for the breakfast included rate if possible. I have only tried two different menu items (Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros) and would like to work down through the rest of the list because the other two were to-die-for. The view on the rooftop is dazzling. Piscine is a very cool spot and if you're staying at the hotel it is certainly worth grabbing a drink up there. You'll really feel that you are having a true New York experience. One thing to bear in mind is that this is a very design-centered hotel, so some with more traditional taste may not go for the sliding doors in the bathroom or the lack of a bathroom counter. The platform bed looks cool and does indeed sleep very comfortably, but if you want the Heavenly Bed experience and a big bathroom vanity, the Westin or a W would be a better choice.

Good west side location. About a block away from the high line. Fun rooftop bar, with tremendous views of the neighborhood (although there was a peculiar odor that wasn't your typical NYC eau de garbage, if you catch my drift). The hotel is super hip, modern. The room was a lot of bare, hard surfaces and efficiency. It had everything you need, if not in an abundance of space (which is common in NYC, to be fair). Actually, the one thing the room did not have was legs on the bed frame. The mattress was resting directly on a platform that was on the floor. Sort of like the kind of platform a stage in a dive bar might look like. Look, I'm not in college anymore. I don't need to sleep on a futon. I don't need you to try THAT hard to be hip. I don't pay for a hotel room to sleep on the floor - even if it is on a mattress. They room key was also weird, and annoyingly over-wrought. You get a metal bar, and an actual key, on a ring, with a big, felt fob. You stick the bar into a hole in the elevator to unlock the floors, you use the key on the room door, and then you stick the metal bar in a hole in the wall to get the electronics in the room to turn on. It's stupid, and it doesn't add anything to the experience, other than mild annoyance at having to think about your hotel room key situation.Were the any actual problems? No. Would I stay here again?

The girl at check out was also very pleasant, but she said she would adjust my bill, and I haven’t seen the adjusted charge come through. Finally there are too many steps to call room service. Typically if it’s a dial “0” situation either the front desk takes the order or the front desk is expected to pick up after 1 ring otherwise room service needs to have their own dedicated line to streamline the process for the customer. Also, the parking garage situation is not very clear on the website and a last minute thought when you pull up in front of the hotel.

The bed was one of the more comfortable ones I've experienced, and the view across the relatively calm street was of the interesting new Zaha Hadid condo building on the Highline.

It started with the instructions to the parking garage which not only were imprecise, they had us turning left the wrong way down a one way street. I finally got there after a couple of passes but only after I pulled into the wrong garage and they told me where to go. The room itself was tiny but well appointed and very clean. The problem was that there was limited space to put anything. The bathroom was particularly bad with no counter or anywhere else to put a bathroom bag. The towel rack was difficult to reach (although they provided a stool) and the toilet was so high that even my feet couldn't reach the ground. The other problem was the elevators which were so dark that even the staff had a hard time finding the hole to insert the key before selecting your floor. On the other hand, the foyer and main floor restaurant were well lit and comfortable. On arrival we ate a light meal at La Piscine on the top floor. It was a beautiful restaurant and the food was excellent.

The bath products and robe are nice.Cons: The outdoor spaces had private parties going on both nights I was there so I couldn't enjoy them. The minimal design of the room meant everything I owned was on the floor. In the bathroom, there wasn't even enough room on the tiny shelf for my cosmetics bag.

Congrats on whomever snagged her - I have been in every industry on the service/hospitality spectrum - and I have hired (and had to fire) a ton of people...and if I were in hospitality still within an accommodations capacity, I would steal her - immediately.I had never stayed at Hotel Americano before, but it was my birthday, and it was hot and sunny, and I just needed a pool so badly.I haven't been on a proper vacation in years due to work necessity - just little stays overnight here and there when possible in the city as an escape to pretend I don't have to go back home after check-out and straight back to ""real life"".Maggie greeted us, checked my ID (I had booked online, not directly, and noticed it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday right away. I explained it was just a last minute thing because I saw the photos and was just feeling like it was ok to treat myself on my own birthday to a nice pool and a perfectly zen night's sleep (the photos they advertise are 100% accurate - I saw several of the rooms on request before check-out, and the images they have online are great, but they can't match the reality of the rooms - it has to be experienced).We joked back and forth, as I was wholly unfamiliar with the hotel - I just wanted to strip and run to the pool.Maggie made sure we knew exactly how to get to the room (there was a full-on, desk-to-elevator-and-room male employee that was also amazing - not one staff member EVER had anything but a big fat smile on their face the entirety of the stay, and I am observant and have worked in Service and Hospitality from being a Server in a Michelin-Starred Restaurant to Party Host at rowdy clubs and Manager of a 3-Door Business including a Club and two restaurants in Fire Island, living under a microscope through all of the experiences - so I can't help but keep an eye on things like that..)More importantly, Maggie actually gave me the impression that she was much more than an employee or staff member.She cared that it was my birthday.She cared about my stay.She sent up a gift.It was almost overwhelming how well I was treated by not only a stranger (back then...since then, I would 100% call her a friend that I just don't get to see enough), but a stranger in a Hotel in NYC that I had NEVER stayed in. Not once.I've stayed at The Standard too many times to mention without thinking about what the grand total must be and then living the rest of today thinking about my life choices...and not one person there except the staff and door people at Le Bain and Top Of The Standard (""Boom Boom Room"") know me/recognize me/smile/make jokes/send up any surprises.Which is shocking, given how often I stay there and how often I am there (almost every Thursday night for ZigZag, random nights for Boom Boom) spending money at their bars.There is no feeling at Americano that you are being ""done a favor"" for being able to stay there.I will be back, every single time I can take a day or a half day off to sit at the pool (even if I have to work), and I will forever staycation at Americano.I do not care what is available on the ""One Night"" App, the ""Hotels Tonight"" App, or on Booking.com/TriVaGo, etc.This is my new home away from home, and I am so grateful for a PERFECT birthday, a beautiful stay, and the absolutely SUPERB service of all staff we encountered during the stay - but I have to give Maggie the full 5-Stars start-to-finish.Had she not been there; had it been anyone else? It could have (and likely would have) been a completely different experience.I have called and been to Americano since, and spoken with Maggie, and she remembers who I am, that I am basically just B-Lining to the pool, and she has always been just as sweet, caring, and pleasant on the phone as she was when we checked in and I first met her.I have a boyfriend, by the way, just in case this comes off as a love letter to Maggie - it is one - just not romantically.I cannot wait to see her and the pool again!!! I am actually calling in about an hour to see how the rooms look for tomorrow.....she's created a monster....BIGGEST, BIGGEST THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE IMMACULATE STANDARDS KEPT IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT!! TOP-TO-BOTTOM (literally....roof deck and pool to check-in) PERFECTION!!!5 MAJOR STARSAlways,James Everett","New York City, New York","itsjameseverett</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0

The bed is on a large wood platform that covers a large section of the floor and raised only several inches above it. The rest of the floor is concrete.

The woman said that only their suites had these tubs, but if I booked one room down from it, and it was available, I could have it... So I booked the 285, rather than the 245 mattress on the floor, and headed over. I got there at 12. I was told that I couldn't have a guaranteed room till 3. I asked about the upgrade and was told, that it was still possible. After sitting in the lobby for 3 hours, I was given my room. No upgrade... I asked, and she assured me that despite the spg site, and their own site both saying they had the room available... It wasn't... Wah waaah.

The dining area is open and inviting, the staff are exceptionally friendly and the food is good. The location is convenient for the Highline, but as others have noted, this is a neighbourhood undergoing gentrification and construction noise is pervasive. We also found it just a block too far away from major subway lines to be considered convenient. The rooms, however, are totally impractical and this is why I would not recommend this hotel. Yes, they are small, but it's the use of the space that irritates. There is no natural light penetrating the deeper recesses of the room and because they are painted black even with the lights on it's impossible to find personal belongings.

The hotel location is convenient, reasonably priced (for being in Manhattan) and the staff is amazing and attentive. My only issue is with the layout of the hotel rooms: the bed sits on a 6"" raised platform so you're basically sleeping on the floor. The platform extends 18"" past the bed on all sides so getting in and out of it makes for a challenge and returning from a night time bathroom run you will trip on the edge getting back in bed. However, the major issue was the cold air drifts from the windows down the wall and surrounds you over the bed giving a uncomfortable chilly sleep. Also, the bed was a little too soft, with no back support; most hotels have firm mattress. It also felt like it was an air mattress, even stranger. Both the small counters in the bedroom and bathroom are so full of hotel ($)snacks, flyers, cotton balls, shampoos and lotions there is no room for any of your personal stuff. There is no place to easily hang your towel other than high above the toilet opposite of the shower. The toilet is uncomfortably high and toilet paper is behind you to your back. There is a ugly black bean bag chair in the corner. I'm sure just as difficult to get out of as the bed, and no place to open your bag, although plenty of closet space with hangers. The room key is an actual key attached to a metal large pen size steel heavy rod. The rod is needed to use the elevator and power for your room.The designer tried too hard to be different. If this was a hotel for children with long legs to reach the toilet it would be fun but for adults, but it makes for a bad experience and never to return.

Please read for your own experience. I wish that I hadn't trusted Starwood.I am a very frequent business and personal traveler in my early 40s. I've been staying in NYC for 20 years and prefer the W Union Square which was booked for the one night that I'm here. I found Hotel Americano on Starwood's website and it was close to where I needed to be for work. I always trust Starwood.Awesome bar/club on the top floor. Definitely stop by for an evening as its sexy, good crowd and music! Fantastic staff that did their best to make my stay as best as possible.STAY HERE IF: You are new to NYC and want to be in the thick of Chelsea and the High Line neighborhood for bars. The rooms are smaller than a cruise ship stateroom, interior, on deck one. I've never seen a smaller hotel room in my life. They remind me of the Tokyo pull out beds that I've seen on tv. I am Starwood Platinum and was in an upgraded room. The sink is smaller than the sink on a 25 foot fishing boat. The bed is on the floor. There is literally no room for luggage. No desk. No chair. Nothing but a bed on the floor.DO NOT STAY HERE IF: You want to get any sleep. I was here for one night. I was ""upgraded"" to a seventh floor room which I had to ask to move at 11:00 pm on a Tuesday because it was so loud that even earplugs wouldn't damper the noise from the bar/club upstairs. At my request, they gladly (and very promptly) moved me to a quieter room on the other side of the seventh floor. They warned me that it was a smaller room, which I couldn't have imagined, but it was. My wheelie didn't even fit by the side of the bed. Beyond believably small. For $435 per night.All good. I just need to sleep. I pulled off the cover and got into bed and the sheets are pilled like I've never seen an ugly Christmas sweater.

Also supposedly a starwood hotel, but we were so disappointed. When we arrived on a 90F degree day, the front desk informed us that the pool is closed ""due to weather condition"". erh. too hot to use the pool? Fine. I went up just to see what it is like, and there were two guys taking photos of each other in the pool. I asked the staff on the roof top if they were photographers or they were guests and was told she has no idea, she just got there. I later determined they were guests and then asked another hotel staff (since the first person I talked to said she doesn't know anything) - can I use the pool and was told he can't see why not. I went down changed and came back up. Another hotel staff was putting out cushion on the concrete stool, told me he thinks they put chemical in the pool. and I said those two guys (pointing at them at the other end of the pool) were just in the pool. And he said um. he doesn't know but I can do whatever I want. I sat down and put my feet in the pool, another hotel guest join me did the same - nothing happened.Next day, another 90-100F day, I went up stair and no one is about. I jumped in the pool. Half hour later two hotel staff came out and told me the pool is closed. I asked why it's closed and she said it's under ""maintenance"". I asked what maintenance? and why there isn’t any sign around the pool and no voice mail or print out to the guests. and she just said they were told by the ""management"" that the pool is closed and offered me a free drink. I think they are just making stuff up. There are also bunch of crap piled up on the stairs: towels, trays, bean bag, storage containers etc.,Back to the room - as other reviews pointed out, the bed is on a platform on the floor. the beanbag ""chair"" it's difficult to get up after you sit in there, the ""desk"" is about 12X35 no way to ""work"" on that.

But that's where the good stops.The mattresses are very low quality - you sink right in, and not in a good way... I tweaked my back on the first night. All the furniture is extremely low, which looks amazing in pics but really not practical for actual staying - felt like I had to on the floor to be able to eat it. The bathroom plumbing is funny - hot and cold were swapped, which is not what you want to be figuring out when running late to your meeting. Perhaps worst, you can hear everything through the walls - for all 5 nights I stayed there, I was woken up at all hours by the baby who cried for hours every night next door, and on thurs night, music from the marquis was blaring through the walls. I come to NYC often, thought I'd try this cool looking spg hotel, but would never want to stay here again, despite the reasonable rates and proximity to my office.The management and staff are great, but the building and room furniture are seriously flawed.

From the moment we checked in, it was clear this hotel is not for business travelers. First, they give you a physical key with a giant rod attached to it. The key is intended to be left at the front desk, which does not give a great sense of security for most places. After that, we waited 20 minutes for hour elevator. There are only two elevators that service guest rooms and the staff usually has one of them locked out, so plan to wait at least and extra 5 minutes for your elevator to come. Next, we got to the room. The mattress is on the floor. There are no storage spaces besides a half closet. The bathroom has nowhere to set toiletries - total disaster. The ""desk"" which is more the size of a TV tray was completely covered with minibar items making it completely unusable. Also, there was no chair, just a stool that sat 18"" from the ground. After having the bean bag chair replaced with an actual chair, I sat down to do some work and realized how difficult outlets were to find. The real issues came when I planned to have some colleagues come to the rooftop lounge. When I sat down at 5, the place was empty. I explained to my server that I had 4 colleagues coming around 7. At 6, the hostess asked me to move tables. She said the table I was in was reserved. When I asked her how my colleagues would fit at the 2 man table, she told me they could stand. Her manager then came over and told me that I could stay. Ten minutes later, she told me I had to leave again. In the end, I went down to my room until the rest of my group arrived and then was given a table after. They didn't even offer to comp a drink!The hotel is also extremely loud, so expect some party people in a room next door.","Boston, Massachusetts","sail2boston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",1,2.0

The rooms aren't very user friendly, no where to sit and do your hair or make up before going out! Rooms are poorly lit and Windows look straight into another building only 10 meters away. No views or privacy hence why they have an opaque blind installed.The rooms are cleaned each day but toiletries are not refreshed. We stayed 5 nights and used the small toiletries up on the first day. They were only replaced on the last day! Only one set of gowns and slippers supplied!?Bed was comfortable and very large but sleeping is difficult with the roof top party music blaring each night.Coffees made at the bar are poor and expensive.

Our friends live in Chelsea around the corner so when we were to return to NYC again in June 2016, we were prepared to again deal with the noise for a location close to our friends. To hedge, we decided to research other neighboring hotels. We ended up finding a better rate (about 20 per night less) at a newer hotel called Innside New York Nomad. It is about 8 blocks away from our friends so we still were leaning toward Hotel Americano. We approached the hotel and asked them to match the rate from Innside New York Nomad. Based on the fact that we stayed there before for four nights, we thought this was a reasonable request. Hotel Americano refused to match the rate and they were snooty about it - I lived in NY for a few years and I hate that NY attitude. Our response - bye bye Hotel Americano and your noisy rooftop and we decided to stay at Innside New York Nomad. This turned out to be fortunate as Innside New York Nomad is NEWER, QUIETER, and CHEAPER than Hotel Americano. We had to walk a few extra blocks to see our friends but it worked out great.

The lobby was very modern yet cozy, and filled with interesting books to look through. We were shown to our Uptown Queen room and were immediately pleased with the aesthetics and design. After a little battle with the music system not working, the staff was kind enough to upgrade us to a suite, where we were able to listen to our music. We were so grateful for this rare opportunity to experience the hotel at its fullest. The Uptown Studio was very roomy, a retro chic style with a living room area, a bathroom, a huge closet, and the coolest bed space ever. The bed was set inside of a wooden cube platform, which sounds strange but it was very comfortable and unique. I thought it was a nice way to separate the bed from the living room, the cube created the impression of being in another room.Toiletries were from Le Labo, and they smelled so good! The shower was very nice, and the bathroom was spacious. There just wasn't a lot of room to put our personal toiletries in the bathroom, no shelving space at all. But apart from that, everything was on point.The common areas seemed kind of deserted, most likely because of the snow storm. But I bet in the summer the rooftop is just amazing, and the lounge on the bottom floor probably gets pretty busy as well. We had dinner in the room, and in the morning had breakfast from the restaurant. Room service was a bit pricey for the portions, but the burgers we ordered were very delicious. And the presentation of the food was different from anything I've ever seen, because it was delivered in a bento box. The restaurant was very pleasant, wide open space, beautiful interior with high ceilings, and good service. When we decided to go out and explore through the snow, we were saved by the umbrella that was provided in the room. It was really sturdy and helped us fight the blizzard. Surrounding areas were very nice, there were a lot of trendy galleries, the high line was very close by, and Chelsea Market was just a short walk away. We're happy to have finally enjoyed this hotel.

He then introduced us to Mo who was undoubtedly one ofthe most kind and accommodating people in the hospitality business.

The uptown queen room was very interesting and we got an orientation to it from the seemingly mandatory bellman, which turned out to be very helpful, since the room is quite unique. Be sure to ask for the AirPlay password for your room so you can listen to your own tunes on the built-in speaker system. Don't plan on hanging in room though for too long, it isn't big enough to sit and relax without wanting more traditional furniture. For relaxation, head up to the phenomenal rooftop bar and imbibe. Sleep? Sure they got you mostly covered. Their design edge has the comforter going to just the edge of the bed. Nice touch? But I want to wrap up like an envelope in the comforter, so not my favorite design feature. Minibar is very well priced for that drink you want while getting pretty before you go out. I'm not cheap, but it is quite nice to be only slightly marked up for this much desired drink. Downsides? Room has no sound barrier from the girl and her dog next door.

First, you need both hands every time you're going in the elevator up to your room: one to insert the metal rod that domes with the key into a hole and one to punch in your floor. They have to be done simultaneously so if you have luggage, a book, coffee, then forget it! Second, the rooms are tiny and poorly designed: no place for luggage, no tables to put your stuff on and the closet is too small to fit your things. The bathroom sink is the size of a salad bowl and there's no place to place your stuff in the bathroom either. You can't even get the towel close to the shower because there's no place to put it or nothing to hang it on. There's no tissue box, but they leave you with 2-3 wrapped Kleenex in a little box in the bathroom! The bathroom and the room are so dark that I had to use my cell phone light when I was trying to put some make up on. This is all easy compared to the noise level. The hotel is across a MAJOR construction site that starts at 6am on weekdays and 7am on Sundays. Not to mention the trash pick up in the middle of the night. I asked to change my room but nothing happened. I complained several times and got offered free breakfast on the last day (seriously?). I will never stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","Batroun, Lebanon","268ranas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Batroun, Lebanon</strong>",8,1.0

This non-central hotel located in the Chelsea warehouse/art district (well central if your main goal is to visit the High Line) is a resolutely austere ""Japanese"" inspired place that neither succeeds in evoking true Asian design nor Asian service (as in the staff if pretty gruff, even for Manhattan standards).THE GOOD?Give me a moment, I'll try to think of something... A lot of arty Europeans with too much money and attitude stay here, so the people watching is interesting.THE BADRooms are ridiculous. It's like something you would have seen in that 90s show Ab Fab, a caricature of the minimalist, Anoushka Hempel, Asian inspired disasters that were prevalent some time ago. Zero space for luggage, Zero space for toiletries, Zero space for humans who pay human money to stay here.A Desk? Too cool for that. A Chair? Too cool for that - sit on a beanbag will you. A Bed? Too cool for that, here is a mattress flung on the floor for you. Key or Key cards? What? Here use this vaguely sci-fi metal thingy to open your door. (Good luck figuring it out in 1 minute).No service elevator. The hotel staff actually carted garbage in the elevator with guests in it. Awesome.The Staff - they really couldn't be bothered (none of my supposed Tablet Plus privileges were honoured).

On the one hand it doesn't appeal to me. On the other hand I am probably not the target audience.Issues are totally with the design of the rooms themselves. The front desk staff could not have been nicer and the room itself was clean and adequately maintained. Location is good for Chelsea. Wi Fi was free and functioned well. Rooftop public area is super nice.So now we come to the room itself - an environment which simply makes no sense to a traveler like me. Middle aged and even when traveling for pleasure having some business to attend to.As others have noted the bed is a mattress on a very very low wooden platform - like maybe 6 inches off the floor. Furniture is one bean bag chair and one what I would characterize as a repurposed small ottoman which I believe it is expected one will use as a chair.. The ottoman like element was related to a shelf that could be used as a desk if the size of your work instruments were maybe that of a small I pad.Want to see your travel companion naked in the shower while you lie in bed or sit on your bean bag - this is the place for you. Don't want to see your partner naked in the shower ? Put a pillow on your face.The shower cutain is just long enough so that if you pull it far enough to one side you can protect your companion from seeing you in the toilet (more specifically on the toilet)if that sort of view doesn't appeal to you. However if your companion shifts to the other side of the room you will have rise from you duties and slide the shower curtain to the other side as it isn't quite long enough to block the view from both sides at once. I am sure if one tries hard enough one can arrange the lights in the bathroom to be low enough and the lights in the room to be bright enough that ones privacy is protected but the switches are so counter intuitive that we could not figure out how to do it. You know if I were 25 again, with a lot more money that I actually had then and headed to NYC for a weekend of debauchery with my hot girlfriend a stylish designed hotel with a mattress on the floor and a see through bathroom might be the coolest thing ever . Middle aged, even in pretty good shape - not so much so.I note that the manager of the hotel responded to a previous commenter who had similar observations with a response that implied that the hotel was designed with a particular market in mind and that market is probably not you. I think that is fair enough.I felt compelled to write this review because the three star rating I gave it really does not at all properly characterize the experience. If you are a young New Yorker looking for a room to share the hot item you picked up at the very chic bar which shares the lobby space this would be five star all the way. For a traveler like me it totally fails to meet my needs. But as I said at the start I don't think I am the sort of customer the hotel is trying to attract","Orlando, Florida","davidgo12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",5,3.0

There was no where to put your toiletries in the bathroom and the lighting was dull in the bathroom and sleeping area. There was very little floor space to even put your suitcase down and open it.

Our bed was a mattress set on a low wall-to-wall wooden platform. You are essentially sleeping on the floor on a soft mattress. I suppose the owners think the minimal look is cool even if patrons over age 35 will have difficulty getting up. Oh, and did I forget to mention the 5-watt globe lamp that hangs down at just the height to hit your head when you do get up?Our room had no chairs. It had a bean bag chair (again, good luck getting up) and a one-foot-square tufted stool. The most comfortable place to sit was the toilet. When we told the front desk we thought the bean bag chair was useless, they offered to remove it and bring a real chair. You shouldn't have to ask for a real chair.The lighting in the room was completely inadequate. A few dim bulbs. My wife found it impossible to get enough light in the bathroom to put on makeup. Don't even bother to try reading a book.And the bathroom was ridiculous. The towel rack was more than 7 feet up the wall and therefore out of reach. The sink was a one-foot diameter bowl with no counter space. The shelf over the sink was about 3 inches wide and lacked space for toothbrush, razor, etc. The shower is a transparent glass cube with occupants visible to those in the room. And if you fail to draw the shower curtain, those using the toilet are also visible.There are few power outlets, and they are not easily reached. Because you must insert your room key fob in the wall to get power, it is impossible to charge devices while you are not in the room.Our room was so cold, I slept in my parka. The thermostat seemed to be just for show. As we rode down in the elevator, we saw one of staff with a heater that some other guest had requested.A few good points: The internet worked. The restaurant has a tasty breakfast. The staff sought to make us feel better about the uncomfortable room by leaving us a bottle of wine and two glasses (the gesture might have been more complete if they had also left a corkscrew).This hotel is in a not particularly nice part of Chelsea and is certainly not worth 340 dollars (plus $52 in taxes) per night.","Bethesda, MD","thanford</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethesda, MD</strong>",30,1.0

The service was top notch. This was especially important, because the design caused a number of problems. For example, the comforters on the bed were purposely undersized, so that they ran along the top of the mattress, with zero overhang. It looks cool, and eliminates the need for staff to tuck in the blankets. This stylistic choice would work, if one person were sleeping alone in the bed. But when you add a second person, you're fighting for coverage under a glorified ""throw."" And they don't keep a second blanket in the closet, so at 1 am, we had to call the desk and ask for another one, so we could both sleep. The excellent staff had one to us ASAP, but call me old fashioned, I shouldn't have to ask the staff for enough blankets on my bed for two people. The Windows have cool automatic roller shades, with a blackout shade behind a sheer shade. Unfortunately, the motor on our shade was broken, which we didn't notice until we returned to our room the first night. The on-call handyman couldn't fix it on the spot, so we had to switch rooms. The rooms are also a nightmare for anyone with bad knees. Nothing in the room, except the toilet, is higher off the ground than a foot- not the mattress, nor the ""chair"" (bean-bag). It has a cool aesthetic, but just isn't comfortable. The bathrooms have no counter space to speak of, and the only tiny shelf in the room runs along the perpendicular wall, so shaving, make-up, or any other kind of sink activity besides washing your hands was, again, inconvenient. In conclusion, I don't recommend it. Great staff, attractive design, but totally uncomfortable.

The rooms are some of the cleverest, best designed I have seen in a long time--both the smaller and the larger. The former are perhaps more interesting for how much they squeeze out of a small space. Putting the beds on a platform gives the room more visual space, making it seem larger. In the larger rooms, the bed alcove is simply marvelous: cozy, yet spacious; self-contained, yet open to the rest of the room; a retreat within a retreat. Great!As noted elsewhere, the bathrooms are small; but they are comfortable and have great towels and toiletries. Yes, there could be a larger sink and a better (or at least more generous) space to stash one's travel kit. But these are small inconveniences for what are elegant and calming rooms. People have noted noise issues here, and it is true that the public areas of the hotel buzz all day and night. I am a very light sleeper, however, and had no trouble at the Americano. Request a room in the back on a middle floor if you are concerned.The restaurant had a bit of trouble managing a small morning crowd, but the Mexican breakfast options (in addition to more traditional fare) were a welcome and tasty surprise.The hotel is ideally located for those who have business on the west side, particularly in the gallery district. Also great for those who want to walk the High Line. Ignore the comments about the neighborhood being sketchy: this is one of the hottest development areas of the city, and as safe as anywhere else in Manhattan.Of special note here is the staff. Every single person is friendly and welcoming--none of the attitude problems that plague hip hotels. These people really want to make you comfortable and get you on your way.

Note: they are never cheap. But I found a decent deal on this place through booking.com so went for it.What the hotel does well is make use of what are small rooms in terms of their ergonomic design space-saving and creating ideas. They provide iPads in the rooms which is a nice touch (even though we all have them these days). They provide very nice toiletries and the transfer on the shower screen is an optical illusion of sorts in which you can see out but those outside can't see in. Well it tries to do this but in fact you can pretty much see in if you look hard enough which means toilet time becomes rather performative!But the room really fell down on its terrible air conditioning facility which only went as low as 63 degrees fahrenheit. We stayed over a very warm NYC May weekend and had to request a fan which only barely resolved the issue. This seemed crazy to me so I even asked if it was a fault but the staff confirmed that was as low as it went. It is made worse by the fact the design experiments with multiple lights which increases the temperature.The mini-bar, though stocked with delightful brands, was not cold at all, due to it being wedged in a cupboard with no ventilation.When the maids were cleaning, they would leave the doors propped open by the latch and every time they would enter and exit they would make the most irritating noise which I had to complain about. To their credit, they did then cease.One of the main attractions to the hotel is the chic roof top bar and pool area. It was the official opening of this on the weekend we were staying and drew a number of guests (lots of gay men...it is in the heart of Chelsea after all) and the party was free entry for hotel guests. While this all felt very exclusive, the service was shambolic and the drink quality terrible. It may have been due to opening night teething problems, but it really was poorly executed. There were also a number of hostesses with clipboards who sole function seemed to be to stand around and do nothing.We didn't sample the breakfast but the hotel restaurant itself seems very poplar and is very nicely laid out (the outside section in particular) but the fact that they couldn't serve a decent coffee didn't fill me with hope.In all this is all very chic and the location is very happening (it is on the high line), but the staff think they are providing something far superior than what they actually are, and the guests cultivate such a level of pomposity that it is not very welcoming. For the money they charge, I wouldn't recommend staying here.Oh, an the beds are mattresses on the floor...but you will know this from the start so you can't really complain.","Bengaluru, India","Daniel R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bengaluru, India</strong>",20,3.0

We arrived fairly late in the evening and realised we'd lucked into a very glamorous proposition indeed, from the buzzy, beautifully lit cocktail bar through the sexily darkened lift to the room itself.For me, the room was perfect for our needs: not overly large (just right for a couple staying for around a week) but the epitome of Manhattan style. I particularly appreciated the iPad full of music, the big, comfortable futon-style bed, the enormous shower-head and, of course, the blind that covered one entire wall that could be, at the flick of the switch, raised to give a heart-gladdening view out over the city.I could quite happily have spent the majority of my time in that room but, being a relative newbie in NY, I had to explore the city. The Hotel Americano was perfectly located for the Chelsea galleries and particularly the High Line.We breakfasted at the hotel most mornings, and the staff were a good mix of professional and friendly, never intrusive but attentive and happy to advise: particular thanks to Tobias, for encouraging me to try the chilaquiles with egg - several weeks after returning to the UK, I found myself craving this! The bar staff too deserve a mention for their expertly mixed cocktails, in generous measures.I really enjoyed my time in NY and the Hotel Americano was a big part of the whole experience, so much so that a return trip is planned in June, when I hope it'll be warm enough to check out the views from poolside...","London, United Kingdom","Pshrink</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

The hotel is situated in Chelsea near the Highline and in very walkable distance from the BoltBus/Megabus drop-off (this comes in handy when you are rolling luggage around and trying to get your bearings!). Extremely friendly front desk staff. The hotel is chic, and fairly modern. You use a long silver keyfob to access the elevators and activate electricity in your room (which was really cool, but also confusing). The room itself is loft/studio like - concrete floor, hidden closet storage, platform bed, and the weirdest black vinyl beanbag chair! I wouldn't recommend staying in this room with acquaintances or children, as the shower wall that borders the bedroom is a mesh metal that you can see through, but not a problem if traveling with spouse/sig other. We both really liked the hotel and loved the proximity to midtown - seriously, it was only about 8 minutes/$8 in a cab to Rockefeller and about $12 to UES! We, unfortunately, did not get to experience the dining or rooftop offerings because of the brevity of our stay, but there is a rooftop, with a pool in the warmer months, and outdoor patios.

This hotel's modern aesthetic hits the mark with the sleek design of both the indoor and outdoor space, including an expansive rooftop bar/lounge area.

Storage in the room was ample and cleverly designed such that it did not disrupt the minimalist decor. Fabulous soft denim robes, well appointed mini bar/snacks, automatice shades, dimmed lighting, and tunes from the in-room iPad, almost kept us from venturing out to the City. Almost. The location in Chelsea made it easy to get around by cab. The neighborhood within walking distance provided restaurants and galleries - we especially enjoyed Empire Diner. Huevos Rancheros perfectly sauced, a superb Bloody Mary, live Cuban music and attentive service made Americano's Sunday brunch memorable.

I (and my little overnight bag) was told I needed accompanying to my ‘Uptown Queen’ room because “the electronics needed explaining.” The electrics were not that complicated – you have to put the fob on your key into a socket to turn on the power.What *was* complicated was figuring out why in a hotel room you would want the floors and walls made of hard, bare, cold poured concrete with no area rug. Bathroom floor was nice, but made of unheated marble so it was also cold. Towels were on a shelf so high that I needed to stand on tiptoes to reach them. A short person would need to step up on the toilet to reach them. The bed was on a six inch high bare wooden platform so you’re essentially sleeping on that concrete floor.Be aware that, if you’re sharing a room with someone else who is not a romantic partner, they will be able to see every single thing you’re doing in the bathroom. There is a metal-and-glass wall separating the shower from the bed area, so showering is a public activity. Soaps, etc. are very nice.There was also zero privacy in my specific room which I discovered when I opened the curtain to look outside. There was a bubble security camera hanging directly outside the window. The view was of the office building across the alley, anyway, so keeping the curtains closed wasn’t a sacrifice. (Except that my room was made of poured concrete and mostly art-free unless you count the flat screen tv.)Everything seemed clean - except for the duvet which smelled strongly of the last guy’s BO which I discovered last thing at night, too late and too tired to call down to get a new one. No coffee or tea pot in the room, and no availability when asked, although they were polite and apologetic about it. There were two seating choices – an upholstered cube stool and a bean bag chair. Lighting was low throughout the room and hotel, including the elevator where dimness made selecting the floor difficult. (I’m not normally vision-challenged.) The disco above thumped until well after I’d fallen asleep. (The hotel provides ear plugs on request if you didn’t bring any).Neighborhood was a little dicey after dark. Not scary, but definitely not on a busy, well-traveled main street. Very close to the High Line.Final words – I wanted to like it but I just kept feeling like I was staying in an Ikea show room.","Boston, Massachusetts","JKHEBoston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",9,2.0

We'd never stayed in Chelsea before and had heard great things about the area so decided to base ourselves there. We picked Hotel Americano because it suits our style but what made this hotel so great was the staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them - they were attentive (but not overbearing) and hugely helpful (in particular, the guy who helped us plan our route to our 10k run at 8am on Sunday morning)! This attitude was shared by all, not just the general manager but also the night porters, who hailed a cab for us to JFK and helped us check out at 4am yesterday! Hotels this cool can sometimes be quite intimidating but we were never once made to feel unwelcome or looked down on. It oozes a classic coolness but part of this in my mind is simply down to the fact that EVERYONE is welcome. We did receive some bad service on our final night on the rooftop bar - our waitress gave the impression that she really didn't want to be there and didn't share the enthusiasm of her colleagues.

Don't expect anything beyond that. I travel to NYC on average once per year and I almost always find a new boutique hotel to stay at. Out of more than a dozen stays in NYC, this is the only hotel that will be receiving a negative review and here is why:1. The owner invested no money in insulating the floors or walls so when there are parties on the rooftop and in the basement, your entire room will be jumping with the sounds of the bass. I came to the room one day around 4 PM after an entire day of shopping. I wanted to catch a rest before going out for dinner and to a club. Unfortunately, my room was the club so I got no rest and had to scratch my evening plans. I had to get out of the room because the sound was too loud to even focus on watching the TV. $350 for a night and I was forced to walk the streets of NYC in order to get some quiet.2. Another aspect of the cheap renovation is the strong odor of animal urine permeating the room. Clearly the building was overrun by ferrel and stray pets prior to being renovated. I've seen houses for sale where the owners had too many pets and did not properly clean and the result is that the smell ends up soaking into the underlying concrete and has to be treated with special chemicals to be removed. Whether the owners spent any time or money doing this when they renovated the building is irrelevant. The room stunk of years of animal urine caked in the underlying concrete.3. The first two are enough for me to never return or recommend the place again but, as if that wasn't enough, there are several clubs on either side of the hotel and apparently not enough public washrooms. My friend and I saw people urinating in the middle of the street at various times of the evening.The whole area is a dump. Avoid it. I wouldn't stay here again if they sold the rooms for $80/night compared to the $350 that I paid.

Local eateries and parks allows you to see more of the local scene vs. the touristy scene of midtown or the financial district. As for the actual hotel - i was not a fan. Bedding on the floor - beanbag for chairs is not my idea for a $300 per night room. I recommend staying in trump soho for the extra money. Hotel pool looked dated and rooftop bar looked cluttered and a little dirty. Regardless the hotel staff was friendly and seemed to know how to run an efficient hotel.

There are many photos already up but the design really does make the small space seem large: my favorite is the one-way glass that forms the wall between the shower and the bedroom so that the person in the shower can see the bedroom but the person in the bedroom can't see in the shower - gorgeous and playful way to not loose space on an actual wall!!The attention to detail in the room was lovely - high end snacks that seemed to be sourced from the local Chelsea Market - robes, slippers, turndown and chocolate at night - the staff was cheerful and courteous. The only issue we had was with the service promptness (or lack thereof): they forgot to bring our bags up after two phone calls and an hour wait - I finally went to retrieve the bag myself and we gave up waiting for ice for the room - then at the rooftop the waiter actually seemed to forget about us so after 15-20 min I left the table to retrieve someone - this is the reason for 4 not 5 stars from me. My friend and I are pretty relaxed people so we were just amused at the service issue but I feel others might have been more irritated... Otherwise the rooftop is incredible - amazing views! Be aware that the pool apparently hosts a DJ dance party after 3pm (maybe just on weekends?) so it's not the tranquil vibe you would think from the photos after that time! The location is perfect - walkable to Penn Station, situated right under the high line - being in Chelsea is a great way to experience a NYC neighborhood vibe while still being accessible to all the sites - I loved it!

There is a construction site right opposite the hotel and, from the looks of it, it will be ongoing for quite some months. The construction takes place Monday-Saturday, 7.30am-5pm, and includes jackhammering. We were on the 6th floor and it was as if the windows had zero sound insulation. You could hear EVERYthing. I should add that we were very much in town to party, but that on weekends there is loud booming music until 4/5 am. To be honest, the loud partying would have been fine on its own, but when it goes on until 5 am, and then 2.5 hours later you're woken up by a jackhammer, it is infuriating, and so this factor alone is a major dealbraker for any near future consideration.- Wifi works only intermittently in the room we were in, quite frustrating.- Room service is average.- Small rooms","London, England, United Kingdom","johnnyw893</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England, United Kingdom</strong>",0,2.0

For the most part a friendly staff. If you want to be close to the Highline you are at the right place. Pretty good location. Great roof deck and pool (small but nice) The restaurant on the main floor was nice, the breakfast was quite good. Now the bad. There is a construction site across the street, just at the beginning stages (August 2014), work starts at 7 in the morning so if you are looking to sleep in don't count on it. City construction continues on the weekend again starting at 7 in the morning with jack hammers. It would have been nice of the hotel to let us know at booking that there will be noise as a result. When you are in the room you can hear everything that goes on in the hallway, people coming and going to there rooms at all hours of the night. You can hear between rooms at all hours of the night. During the weekend you can hear the DJ on the roof (we were on the 5th floor), pretty loud. The room doors don't quietly shut they slam.The rooms are small, we were expecting that, but not expecting to be as small as it was. The bedroom area fits a bed, a very small wall mounted desk, a stool and a bean bag chair. Don't count on doing any work, the desk barely fits a lap top and sitting on the stool for any length of time is very uncomfortable. Not sure why the beanbag is in the room, you really can't sit on it, it takes up valuable space which the room can not afford. With the exception of the big windows which are very nice the room can be dark, the bulbs in the hall and bathroom are very low voltage so it is difficult to see anything, this also goes for the elevator, very dark, hard to see the floor numbers. The bathroom sink reminds me of the small sink you would see while at the dentist the one you spit in. Although the shower is a good size and the pressure is great the shower curtain is too short and too narrow so the water floods into the rest of the bathroom. The shampoo, conditioners and body were are great all by Aesop!! nice touch. Now to the bed, although it is very comfortable and it seemed to be a queen size it comes with a duvet cover that is a shade bigger then a twin so if there is two in the bed you are both pulling the duvet off the other person. We had to ask on two occasions to send up a bigger comforter. I'm sure I can go on and on but I will stop here. Very trendy, I'm sure it is a great place for the ""cool"" crowd, but for someone like me I would not be in a rush to go back.","Vancouver, Canada","rquinnell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",9,2.0

Until recently I’d never seen a sale or discount on the rooms (which is how I generally choose my NYC hotels). Finally, after checking on it once again a sale popped up on Hotels.com and I grabbed a room for around $230/night for three nights. I was definitely note disappointed. The rooms, like the public areas, are very minimalist and modern. The rooms are small but very functional, with a view through the steel mesh façade out over the city that is fantastic. My room featured a built into the wall that was small but spacious enough to do what I needed. The bathroom was small as well, but also well appointed. There was a very nice rain shower and a small sink which would normally drive me nuts as there was no vanity; however, the architect realized this and designed a nice ledge running the length of the bathroom on which one can place one’s toiletries. The linens were nice and the room came with a small tote that could be used to bring things up to the pool (more on that in a moment). The bed was extremely comfortable but it’s worth noting that it is installed on the floor. That is to say there is a small step up from the main floor of the room and the mattress rests on this platform. If you are someone with limited mobility or who has difficulty bending to or rising from the floor this will be an issue for you. For me it was very comfortable and when the blackout shades were lowered via the powered remote control, I was ensconced in a nice, dark cocoon that led to a great night’s sleep. As a hotel guest I had easy access to the hip room bar. It is a very nice view from the top floor and the bar, like it’s sister in the lobby, is filled with beautiful and stylishly dressed people who all seem at home in Chelsea, one of the centers of the contemporary art world. If this is your scene, you’ll be right at home. If not, you may be a little intimidated or put off. However, I should stress that this has nothing to do with the hotel staff, who could not have been more welcoming. Everyone I encountered at the hotel was fantastic, save perhaps for the breakfast waiters who provided rather indifferent service. The staff made me feel very at ease and many were quick to point out this or that feature of the hotel or the surrounding neighborhood. I will say that the pool itself should not be a major draw of the hotel. If you are expecting some gorgeous natatorium in which you’ll be tracing elegant laps you should think again. The pool is little more than a splash tub around which a large deck has been built. It is nice enough I suppose, and perhaps on a stifling NYC day it would be a welcome relief, but its size is such that it would be crowded with more than three or four people enjoying it at once. In conclusion, the Americano is a great hotel. I come to New York several times a year and have stayed at a great many different hotel, all of which I review here, and I definitely hope to stay at the Americano again soon.",park city UT,"expeditiondaddy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>park city UT</strong>",156,5.0

In fact, some of the greatest gems in modern hotel history have come out from this sprawling metropolis. Which, in turn, gives the Big Apple an advantage that not many urban spots enjoy - diversification within hotel genres.Hotel Americano is a byproduct of this advantage. Its minimalism is not foreign territory to New York hotels, but its twist is. This hotel feeds a niche of customers who find it hard to scour for hotels in the dynamism of Chelsea, a part of Manhattan that is not well-equipped with accommodations of this ilk. Modernity with a little frill.Rather than concentrating on the modern interiors of the hotel, the concept behind it allows for a rehashing of the definition of architectural modernity. It derives that utilitarian aura of providing only the necessary of luxuries without overburdening the visitor with hotel formalities. Still, the hotel is not afraid to venture into different styles like boho chic and undertones of art deco for the sheer purpose of warming up the austerity of what has became second nature for run-of-the-mill modern hotels.The service is basic yet efficient, and there is an iPhone/iPad App made specifically for your hotel needs. All the amenities needed by a visitor in the room are available. The views overlook a quieter side of a busy city. The lighting is carefully constructed to give luster to the tones of the hotels – grays and whites with a splash of pastels. The cocktail bar in the lobby is extensive and is now one of the trendiest haunts by locals with a little zing.Hotel Americano embodies everything New York. It tries to be everything you can’t find in tourist-trodden Midtown, yet doesn’t act uppity about it. Albeit, with an authentic New York feel without compromising its architectural integrity.Original review on FLIGHT965.com","Kuwait City, Kuwait","Flight965</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuwait City, Kuwait</strong>",67,4.0

A hotel is only a building until the staff breath warmth and life into it. Special thanks to Joanne and Lucci at the front desk, Rickie as concierge, barista Jesus and, in particular, Tobiasz, who helped us start each day in the restaurant with friendliness and humour. Good selection of American and Mexican breakfast foods, coffees, and juices. Couldn't ask for more. Housekeeping staff were super-great with turndown in evening. Comfortable room with everything we needed, down to the slippers. Noting that we are in our early 50s and were fine with futon-style bed (with great mattress), but older, stiffer folk may find getting out of bed a bit of a challenge. Noise from ground floor and rooftop patio when the window's open, but not so much that it disturbed our sleep. Note that the rooftop pool is about the size of a dining room table; more for cooling one's feet. Also, re recent comment on elevator; wand is only slightly different than typical card system at most hotels. Great, great, great location for High Line and Chelsea art galleries.

All I can say is that the reviewer has a unusually low bar for comfort! Let me attempt to articulate my discomfort. The elevator (which even the ""Amazingly Comfortable"" reviewer said needed instructions to operate) was dark, hot and slow. The room, when we finally reached it, needed to be powered up with your room ""key."" The bed, which has been described as a ""platform bed"" is actually situated on a wall to wall wooden structure. A more precise description would be a mattress on the floor (see picture). The rest of the floor, which is reached after rolling, crawling and dragging oneself off the mattress, is concrete. That's right-concrete! Nary a rug or carpet to be found. The seating in the room (I use the term seating very loosely) consists of a beanbag chair which, rather than being filled with beans, appears to be filled with dry cement. The other seat is some sort of polyp covered with cheap carpeting that, I suppose, serves as the desk chair. There is also a hanging lamp situated near the mattress that, as far as I can tell, serves no useful purpose. It contains about a 5 watt bulb and is situated in a way that can only serve as an impediment to getting out of bed. There is no way that one could use the lamp to read or to serve any other useful purpose. Assuming that one is able extricate oneself from the mattress, the next great adventure is the bathroom. It clearly falls into the ""are you kidding me"" category. The sink is approximately 12 inches in diameter (check out the picture if you think I am kidding) with the faucet protruding right to the center of the sink thus rendering it almost useless. It is not even as large as the average water fountain. As a sink it may be avant garde but it is a waste otherwise. The shower is also in a class by itself. Whether the person taking a shower can actually be seen by anyone else in the room is kind of a moot point. The person taking the shower sure feels that his ""privates"" are on open view. It may be a decorating conceit, but it sure makes taking a shower (or going to the potty) an uncomfortable experience. The shelf over the sink is about 3"" deep. We spent the entire weekend worrying about breaking a glass on the concrete if we accidentally missed the tiny shelf. Also, the towel rack is about 6'3' off the floor. If you are short in stature, you might need stilts to reach the towels.I will say that the hotel had a very nice rooftop bar with views of the city which seemed to be populated with many more people than the hotel had rooms for. It was also very noisy and the noise could be heard at all hours in our room on the 7th floor.In the interest of fairness, I must point out that my wife and I are senior citizens who would have been much better served in the average Hampton Inn. This is clearly not a hotel designed for anyone over the age of 40. Obviously, based on some of the other reviews, there are many who will disagree with my assessment. All I can say is that we have stayed in hotels all over the world. I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel where I was less comfortable. I suppose that some sort of design statement was being made. Clearly, the comfort of the guest was not a primary consideration in the design of this hotel.","Brevard, North Carolina","BigO8479</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brevard, North Carolina</strong>",26,1.0

Too many of them with an arrogant attitude, loud music and apparently more important then hotel guests. The Americano is a trendy club then and not a hotel anymore. - 88 dollars for a bottle of white wine on the rooftop terrace?

Then the meal is downstairs in the Americano restaurant.When we visited there we were not resident at the hotel but we had booked a table in advance.We told the staff in reception that we had a travel zoo voucher and were shown to a lift to go to the upper floor bar. We were greeted there by a waitress who asked if we had a reservation. We told her our name and the voucher. We were shown to a table and a waiter came for our drinks order. We again showed him the voucher and he brought our cocktails for us. From that point on the service was very poor and we had to keep asking for a food order. Eventually this came. When the bill came it was for the full amount of the food with no consideration for the voucher. We complained and the manager came to explain we should not have been seated in this particular restaurant. After explaining all the above they did honour the voucher but it was a bit embarassing having to do this whilst other customers looked on.

The elevator is also beyond dark and dingy with a carpet that appears dirty and worn. The bedrooms are insanely small with no chair to sit on besides a beanbag. Please note - there is no place, I mean no place to place your bags and unpack - forget it. You must use the floor. The bed is a soft, lumpy, mattress placed on a raised wooden dais - its about 6 inches off the floor which is hard, cold concrete. I can only imagine how nice this feels in winter. The shower stall is a cube which is open to the bedroom, so you must literally draw the shower curtain to have any sense of privacy as you are sitting on the toilet. The sink is the smallest sink I have ever seen in a hotel room - 8 inches in diameter, maybe. Also, the bathroom ""toiletry ledge"" is a three inch wide metal shelf which holds absolutely NOTHING. I had to keep my bag of toiletries sitting in the sink - hey, at least the sink came in handy for something! The staff was nice - I will say that of the hotel.

The rooms are very clean, well maintained, and just so chic. We actually thought the concrete floors were nice! It didn't make the room cold or anything because the heating was keeping us warm. The beds, linens, and pillows were so comfortable -- we slept so well. The Aesop products and Marvis toothpaste added to the stay as well. The lobby is very well designed and the Americano restaurant had great brunch options. The food was delicious and coffee was very good quality. I took one star off for a few reasons. One, because of the thin walls. I woke up one night because I could hear the room next door making noise. One guy was even hiccuping non-stop and I could hear that… Maybe he was in the hallway, but it was so loud. Also, the light switches are a bit annoying. There isn't one master light near the bed to turn the lights off, so we would have to get up and individually turn off each light. The shower curtains could also be wider to cover the entire shower area.Other than those things, Hotel Americano is the perfect accommodation for young people (and older if you don't mind walking a lot and smaller rooms) who want to get away from the main hustle and bustle of NYC.

The small lobby acts as a buffer between the entrance and its dining room/restaurant. The welcome is chilly much like the art galleries and you have a personal concierge who has to tell you how to operate the elevator, open your door and turn on the lights and the thermostat and raise the curtains using a steel rod and a conventional key--it is that complicated. The room I stayed in had a raised wooden platform with a great mattress and crisp cool sheets and feather/down pillow, a flat screen mounted on the wall, an Ipad tethered to a cable with free internet access, great bar selection (not unreasonably priced). The room is small but the furnishings are well curated and likely all carried by Design Within Reach. The bathroom products are the best I've ever seen--Aesop--a Melbourne based company--and these alone would have cost you $50 if purchased from their website or MrPorter.com. The High Line is less than 1/2 a block and the Chelsea Market, Cafe Grumpy, Del Posto, Red Cat, Collichio and Sons and the Meatpacking district are merely blocks away. The subway alas is further out.

I should have researched this, so make sure you look into it against your dates if the rooftop is a draw card for you too. In spite of this, the hotel itself was still able to impress. Mostly because I adore its aesthetic. Not to say the staff weren't great too (they truly were), but it's the detail in the clean, modern design that excites the most. The basic rooms are super small, but well designed, and so cool. Americano is a great little hotel, showcasing a well-executed, sophisticated design direction. The Skyline Walk and 'Sleep No More' (theater production) are great attractions literally steps away, but if you want to be right near most the tourist action, Chelsea - whilst a great area, the market is a must visit - probably isn't the spot for you.

When I entered the lobby, I quickly realised that the photographer of Americano's promo shots should probably get some award for, well, making it look way better than it really was. Cheap finish of many areas somehow didn't add to the design aspect of the hotel. I mean, grey corridor walls... local hostel called and asked their paint back. The room was small and not very functional. Tiny table with no space on it, glossy beanbag, 3 telephones - a paradox of a room pretty much.The famous pool was tiny, more of a water feature. And to get to the pool, you have to go through the restaurant, which cancelled my plans of swimming in the evening.To be fair, this probably is not the worst hotel in New York, and they have good chances of improving.

Now I have 2 I will not return to. Ughhh!!1. Showers are see through but it is not obvious. Our daughter came to visit us the next morning while we were there and much to my horror I could see my husband on the toilet and then showering. I told her not to turn around. She was glad I warned her. I wouldn't have cared except he did not know anyone could see him. There is no way to know until someone is in the bedroom and someone else turns on a light in the bathroom. Very uncool. The standard has a glass bathroom, which was fine because it was obvious. We loved the Standard. Just creepy at the Americano that there is no warning. The other weird thing is the only way you don't see the toilet is if the shower curtain is closed but it doesn't complete shield that area and if it is open it the whole bathroom is see through.2.They have no parking or any parking building they are connected to. We got there and were basically told good luck and here are some place to try. Took us almost 2 hours of block circling to find something. All the parking building were full. Some were very hard to back out of. We almost missed our lunch reservation. When I called the lady at the front desk to ask if I could cancel our reservation so we could go somewhere with valet she said no and seemed annoyed with my need to find parking. I have been to NYC 100's of times and never experienced anything like it.3.They have this weird key that has to stay in the wall to keep the electric on. You have to take it out to leave the room. Needless to say, you can't charge anything while out of the room. Also, if you take the key out at night you can't turn on any lights. Just a pain. The room comes with an iPad that has less that 10% battery because the key is not plugged in until you get there. 4. Bathroom is the size of a closet and the toilet is a glorified potty chair. The whole room was tiny and the pictures on their website are misleading.5.Only one chair in the room and that is a beanbag chair. I don't even want to think about it. Gross.6.We had a reservation for breakfast. Went to eat and no one even acknowledged us. I went to the front desk and was told to just seat ourselves. That is fine but why did they call to verify my reservation if it was seat yourself and no one was acting as hostess. confusing.I won't be back. Just a weird annoying experience. The reason this review is so long in coming is I thought I had already written it. I was really upset about it and know I wrote this before but maybe it didn't go through. Saw an advertisement for it today in a magazine and it reminded me to rewrite the review.

If you prefer to lie on the bed with your romantic partner staring at the funky furniture, no problem. If you need to move around the room, use the desk and have a good reading light (the lighting overall is atmospheric, rather than illuminating), then maybe this is not the hotel for you.The light switches remained a mystery for the duration of our stay and a faulty bulb in the passage lading into the room remained broken for the duration of our stay (after we reported it on arrival). We stayed in a Studio, which is a lot bigger than the standard room.The bathroom has a miniscule basin, with almost no space around it for your toiletry bag or anything else. The alcove containing the bed was beautiful and the bed very comfortable. The rooftop bar and pool are very cool and fun and I think the hotel is ideal if you are a big socialiser. We aren’t. Apart from the bar on the roof there are a number of clubs in the area so it can get noisy at night.There are also a lot of galleries around and the hotel is an ideal base from which to explore them and the HighLine (a feat of modern architecture and ingenuity) which is accessible from the streets on either side of the hotel. Other than that it was a bit out of the way for us.There is nothing wrong with the Americano and my ambivalent review is more a reflection of my taste rather than the quality of the hotel.

In hindsight we decided we could have fit in one room, with some extra cushions or an extra small mattress on the platform. Regardless, the point is, this isn't really a family hotel. Although there were a lot of tourists, they were younger or traveling without kids. It is great for what it is, but if you are looking for a family place this is not it- despite the pool! (My kids loved it though- they thought the platform bed was way cool!).That being said, I can very well imagine my husband and I enjoying a getaway at the Hotel Americano, with the rooftop bar and pool, and the up and coming neighborhood. He occasionally has to stay in the city for a night or two for work, and he has announced that this is his new favorite place. He loved the modern look, the location, the fact that it was a small place. I wasn't so in love with it- outside of the bar and pool, when it came to sleeping I didn't think the platform bed was very comfortable, and the only chair was the bean bag, so there weren't great seating options. And, I personally am not a fan of rain showers. If you do stay here don't take a 9th floor room. It is right under the roof- with the bar and pool- and the music was extremely loud until 1:20 am. Since we were there with kids, we weren't on the roof enjoying the scene, but trying to sleep through the noise. Fortunately, they were so exhausted, they fell asleep anyway!",Connecticut,"Christina Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Connecticut</strong>",18,4.0

And how could I imagine that I would hear it again before 11am in the morning?They are considered as a ""cool"" hotel, and it actually looks cool. I liked the small cafe on the first floor, staffs were friendly and helpful. But, just like other people wrote, to me, it looks like made just to look cool and not comfortable to use/stay. Its sink is too tiny. Your toilet paper is on your back, and you need to twist your waist in strange way, when you need it. The shower and the sink are too close and once you use the shower, the floor will be all wet .... Right in front of the tiny bath room is the door to the out side ...which made me feel weird.I wanted to love this hotel because I stayed in many hotels in Manhattan (over 25 hotels), and in Tokyo or other cities in Japan (over 20 ) too , and I know that we need to understand in Manhattan and Tokyo, we sometimes get the smallest room with the highest price, but the design can help it to help us feel more comfortable...I am from Japan and I heard from my friends that they tried to use Japanese style when they designed this hotel.. but...I am sorry, there are so many things I can complain! Also, please be careful if you need to work or eat in your room. In my case, they didn't have any tables or desks or chairs in the room.

I had been intrigued by all I had read about it, but when in New York, I need to stay in Midtown when I am on business and I usually stay in the Gramercy to East Village corridor when there for pleasure. Fortunately, a recent excursion had me in Chelsea, so I had a perfect excuse to try the Americano. I had some concerns, given the handful of negative (and some downright nasty) comments by Tripadvisor reviewers. But in my experience, the hotel lived up to what appears to be the majority view that this is a great property.All of the glowing reviews are accurate. Each staff member I encountered was relaxed, friendly, and helpful. We stayed in a superior downtown king room on the 9th floor, and it was plenty big. The bed was extraordinarily comfortable. The rain forest shower was the first one that I've ever encountered that actually had decent water pressure. The one-way glass in the shower is great because it lets in lots of natural light from the room; without it, the bathroom would be dark. The room was spotlessly clean. And the design was both stunning and ingenious.As to the negative reviews, I can only guess that the travelers didn't do their homework. There's plenty of information out there, so there's no excuse for a guest being ""surprised"" by the highly polished concrete floors, the platform beds, the quirky lights, and the bean bag chair. Those are design features and they work. In fact, my biggest concern had been that the design would appear too contrived, but not so.We ate breakfast both mornings in the restaurant--healthy granola and fruit the first day and Mexican inspired entrees the second day. The food was excellent and the service was relaxed and comfortable. When I was alone the first morning, the waiter brought a New York Times to my table. We had drinks by the rooftop pool late one afternoon before going out for dinner--it's beautiful space and would be a great place to watch the sunset. So if you want a fun, friendly, and chic property in the Chelsea/Meatpacking area, the Americano is the obvious choice. As for some of the criticisms expressed by prior reviewers, yes, the only real seating in the room (besides the bed) is a beanbag chair so perhaps look elsewhere if you plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room. And if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night (and want to go to bed before 2:00), you may want to get a room on the 8th floor or below so the music from the rooftop club scene club doesn't bother you. My only wish is that the Americano had rooms with two beds, but that's a common complaint of mine with respect to boutique hotels. It certainly won't stop me from staying there again, but it does influence with whom I'll be traveling. In sum, The Americano pulls off perfectly exactly the look and feel and vibe for which it is striving.","Alexandria, Virginia","James B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",24,5.0

But in the end we enjoyed our stay.The rooms are really small and the bed is a platform on the floor. There is an unfortunate bean bag chair that takes up too much of the minimal space. The mini bar snacks took up most of the tiny desk.After a little rearranging (ditching the snacks into the rather ample closet) and using the bean bag as a luggage stand, we found we actually had plenty of space for everything.The rooms are really quite nice with expensive fixtures and nice - albeit minimal - touches. The towels and sheets were fantastic, as was the soap/shampoo and lighting.There are some inconsistencies however. For some reason, we received a top sheet only every other day. The comforter was rather small so it was a bit uncomfortable without the sheet. The gorgeous geranium scented body wash was only left on some days.The neighborhood is under construction so there is a lot of noise that starts early and the sound proofing of the hotel is below average for a new hotel. This was not a big issue for us because we were there for work - served as our alarm clock.We really loved the delis and restaurants in the area. The pizza place across the street was fantastic. And the hotel's food was really good too.On balance it is about a 3.5 of 5 given the price and some of the issues, but we left with a good impression so I am rounding up.Don't stay here if you have a bad back and are a light sleeper.

There's space for a bedside shelf, a bigger bed and somewhere to sit but it's not used. We stayed a couple of nights at the Standard earlier this week. There the rooms are similarly small and the hotel is priced at a premium thanks to its design. But they pull it off. The Americano doesn't quite. It wouldn't take much though: get bigger, more comfortable beds in, ditch the ridiculous bean bags, put a shorter cable in the crazy light hanging at thigh (sic) level by the bed, put a shelf in the bathroom so guests sont have to leave washbags on top of the wc and pop a shelf with a light switch in behind the bed.

Food: Although not cheap, the quality of the breakfast was excellent. However, you get what you pay for and quality food isn't cheap. I had the 'green' smoothie, not because I particularly like smoothies, but because I would be 'good' and have something 'healthy' - it had spinach, kale the works in terms of anti-oxidants etc. I was truly expecting something very horrible but very healthy ... my ecstatic surprise to find it was the best smoothie on the table :-). I asked the kitchen staff if they made it on site and sure enough it was made from scratch on site. Lovely eggs benedict and great mexican eggs, that were mexican and not tex-mex.3. Atmosphere: very relaxed downstairs, good bar and a good vibe without being too noisy and crazy.4. Rooms: we had a small room but it had everything we needed. Mattress on a raised floor which was very comfortable. Sheets good, shower good, very simple with an urban feel to it. It is not the Mark or the Four Seasons but you are not paying those prices either. I feel the price quality was excellent.5. Borrowed some bicycles from the hotel and rode through New York.

All the staff seemed to be pleasant and helpful. On check-in I was told i'd been upgraded to a King room so that was an excellent start. I was accompanied to my room by one of the staff and given a tour/demo of the room - where various controls were, how things worked etc. This was useful and appreciated - finding the spot to insert the activating rod-thingy is a bit of challenge in a dark, black walled entry. But not a big deal. The old skool key to the room was odd. The room had a clean, contemporary design that i liked. Very comfortable and peaceful. Big windows looking over a rear courtyard and adjacent fire escapes - i liked the view. The inroom i-Pad was cool, the vinyl bean bag chair not so much.I only picked up coffee at the lobby cafe/bar so didn't try any of the restaurants or other amenities. I choose the hotel specifically for the location, to explore the High Line Park, Chelsea, etc. Lots of galleries, restaurants, clubs in the area, Hudson river and pathway at the end of the block, a couple of delis around the corner. Not too far from the subway (23rd) - so it was easy to get to MOMA, midtown, theatres, etc.I always try to find smaller lifestyle/boutique hotels when i travel, and Hotel Americano fits that category.

The surroundings offer a ""slow"" view on NY, starting from the High Line passing right next to the hotel. Leaving the hotel you find yourself right in the centre of the art galleries compound. You can wolk for six blocks down, and enjoy the most interesting view on contemporary art NY can offer.As the hotel belongs to a Mexican company, it is easy to hear a nice spanish accent at the reception desk. Even if the boys and girls working there are nice and helpful, the feeling is that few of them completed their studies in the hotellerie. But it is appreciable their effort in welcoming you properly. - RoomsRooms are all quite small, whether the level you choose. I have been there three times for business, and had the Queen Superior once, the King Superior twice. All the rooms are equipped with a futon, therefore if you hate sleeping few cm from the floor, this info is relevant for you. Nevertheless I always found the mattress very comfortable and the beds I slept in more than adequate to my height (I am 1,91cm or 6.3). Four big and medium-soft pillows are the standard. I have read about the bean bag chair not being comfortable. I agree with that. Sometimes design derails and becomes un functional. The toilet is nice, I would say small but well organised. The amenities reconcile yourself with a much needed zen phase after travelling for too long. The skin care company Aesop has been smartly chosen to provide a pleasant experience for the senses. Another top note is the multimedia system available in the room: an iPad is connected via airport to the room sound system, filling the space with great soft music. Ask the reception for the airport password of your room: in this way you can play music directly from your iphone.Internet connection is free, and therefore very welcome.- RoofOn the roof life is beautiful, especially if you happen to travel in the warm period. The openair terrace offer a mix between food and drink until late evening, then the party starts and somebody might jump in the mini swimmingpool, probably due to too much drinking.The service here is less cheerful, maybe 'cause nightclubbers tend to be more rude then the usual hotel clients. Anyway, I havent stayed after midnight, therefore I cannot give any advice.- Spa or GymMissing- BreakfastIf you decide to stay in the hotel for breakfast, you won't be disappointed. No buffet, only menu (which is good).- Room serviceSeveral time I order dinner in my room. You can use the iPad and use the Americano application. You will access the a visual version of the Room menu, very useful for understanding what the food looks like and its size. All the dishes come in a bento, quite practical. You pick the menu, the drink and decide at what time you want everything to be brought at your door.

The room was small, but so are most of New York hotel rooms. The bathroom was a cool design, but again impractical. The sink was so small so that my partner's hand was larger than the sink. The shelf area to hold your toiletries was maybe about 2.5 inches wide so that placing things on it was difficult. Toiletries provided were nice. Aesop. They were generous with those. The lighting in the bathroom was poor. I enjoyed the glassed wall open into the room. Lighting in the room in general was hard to figure out. Many switches, but unclear which one works what device. Just a minor annoyance. I loved the restaurant and we had package that included breakfast which I thought was very generous in what it offered and fun!!! Good food. Service tended to be nice.

I was in room 74. When checking in, I was given a long rod which you have to use for the Elevator & to activate the lights in your room- really strange, but at least you can leave the key at the desk when leaving for the day to explore. To begin, if you are a business traveler, traveling with children, or love functionality in a hotel room, I wouldn't recommend staying here, due to the following reasons (none of which bothered me): there is practically no where to sit, aside from a really unattractive black bean bag which I didn't use. There is a very small, low to the ground desk with a small green very low to the ground chair to sit on- not really comfy, but fine for me. My room was very small, but I loved this fact. The bed was super comfortable & the A/C kept my room super cold :) The pillows & sheets were awesome! The cool concrete floors, cool view of the buildings & High Line, info packed IPad, Unique mini bar items, & long mirror were awesome- loved all of these features!

From the extremely lovely Joanna and her colleagues on reception, to the colombian guys I had a joke with as I rolled back in at 6am in the morning to the barmen chatting whilst serving me expresso as I nursed another hangover, to Jose who brought me drinks while I chilled by the pool it was always a pleasure talking to young, friendly, articulate people who always seemed to be always there to help but never to busy to talk.A great place and officially my favourite hotel in New York.","London, England, United Kingdom","Ben_Pain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

In New York I well enjoyed Morgans back in the day, as well as the original Royalton, Paramount, and Hudson. In Milan I loved both the Straf and the Gray, and so on. But lately it seems each new designer boutique hotel has to be more novel, more extreme, than the last. And the inevitable result is a hotel like the Americano, probably the most ridiculous hotel I have ever tried.My tiny room had essentially two pieces of furniture - the bed, which was a mattress on the floor like a college student sleeps on, and a black patent-leather (shiny vinyl) beanbag chair. Now I'm not a phobic type of guy, but I looked at that chair and asked myself, how many couples have had their way with that chair? I literally didn't want to touch it, I didn't even want to lay my clothes on it. This is ""design""??The other thing that seems to be happening to hotel rooms these days is that they're full of ""secrets"". In this room, the designer decided to hide the TV remote in a secret compartment in the floor beside the bed with an unmarked lid. Heaven forbid somebody should SEE the unsightly TV remote. The other secret I never figured out was how to turn on the sink and shower lighting. I flipped every switch I could find in the entire room without success. When I told the receptionist that I never got the lighting to work she very dismissively asked me why I didn't call reception. To turn on the lights!Yes the rooftop bar was pretty cool, too bad the service was so terrible. I mean, our waitress was completely in lala land even after my party stressed that we had dinner reservations we had to meet.Let me end by saying something nice - the Aesop toiletries were very good.","Providence, RI","GiftBizGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Providence, RI</strong>",44,2.0

And it´s true, our room was tiny (but then I don´t expect to spend much time in it when I´m in NYC), it had fantastic and very open views and I loved the modern and stylish look. The bed is a platform bed so if high beds is what you are used to, or you have difficulties getting up from low furniture, this is NOT the place to come to. The bathroom is small ... but does one need much more than that: unless you want to wash your hair in the sink why would one want a larger one? Don´t know, this is a diverse universe and luckily NY offers all kind of different options to different people. We stayed four nights (in july) and I personally absolutely recommend this place: the design is stylish, location is just perfect (right next to the highline and the Chelsea Market), the staff was really nice (perhaps a bit slow to react) , the place has an great vibe, the terrace is ... how can I put it? amazing, breathtaking. To float in the swimming pool looking at the Empire State was an experience in itself. It´s modern, stylish and hip ... with a latino flavour. And that is something that I just loved!. We travel a lot, stay in tons of hotels in different part of the world, and I know for sure I have found my place in NY.

We booked the Americano as a couple taking their honeymoon - albeit 11 months after first getting married; my wife being editor of a Swedish design and architecture magazine and me also working in the same field and, thus, bound by deadlines most of the year. So this whole trip was a pretty big thing. For one thing, we're journalists and get paid a pittance so money spent on accomodation was done after weeks of research, letter writing (The Jane was very good at responding to enquiries with a real passion, positive attitude and attention to detail - we'll move to that 'attitude' factor later). Secondly, we pay attention to the 'design' tag. Our check in was swift and welcoming, with Chris being a bit of a charmer. He even paid a bit of attention to a request for a table to be booked at a restaurant - which never arised, so potential questions over the talents of the concierge abilitys of Americano. The room (an uptown queen) was good and well designed although having the assault the elevator with a key fob/sex toy was probably a bit overkill. Our shower had a leak in the framework but it was good to see the hotel had responded to rumours of being noisey in the hallways by adding carpet to the floors. A shame as we like a bit of exposed concrete. The positioning of the lighting was good in the bathroom, which always gets my goat - not being able to have a decent shave through badly thought-out lighting happens too much in hotels today. That said, the sink is tiny and needs a plug. The hotel's application was a great touch too.Bar wise, the downstairs bar was welcoming enough as was the rooftop, which does need some better way of being 'closed' if it's raining. Simply not having anyone there is a bit tacky and the impact of heading all the way up in the lift only to be greeted by soggy, covered furniture is a bit of a let down. The area too is fine, plenty to do, a bit of walk to the tube but that's fine. Some have said it's great to have a coffee bar available in the morning but the hotel would probably be better off getting around the changing the pricing on the wall. To be told in a flip manner by a member of staff that something is a ""Different price"" because ""The prices on the wall are, like, from when the hotel opened, like hahaaa, so old..."" is a bit daft. You seem to make a bit of money from the interest earned on the incidentals deposit so perhaps invest in a few vinyl decals. You ""So don't want to be, like, 2011!"" do you?So far so mixture of good and bad. So let's get to the bad. Incidentals. If I am told that a rate is a rate then that's the price it should be. I'm happy to give a deposit if I am told about it in advance. I'll even hand over a card to cover something unforseen and happy for the details to be kept after the stay for a few days. But to check an account and find that 100 dollars a night has been taken from my card without my permission and without good notice is a disgrace. Then to be told that the money has not been put on reserve but actually removed is far worse. The poor lass in reception was in no position to respond in any way close to being considered 'adequate'. In my wife's eyes, this issue jaded her experience of the Americano so we'll probably not return as a result.

Unfortunately that was the case. The hotel design is beautiful and the rooftop bar and restaurant offer fantastic views. (Those are the only two positives about the Americano). We had dinner on the rooftop and had an incredibly rude waiter. He seemed irritated that we only ordered about $55.00 in food and drinks. When our food was brought to the table it was practically thrown down. Not a word from the waiter. Never a follow up to see if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. We wanted two glasses of wine but it never happened. After dinner we asked for a desert menu and he reluctantly dropped one on the table for us to share. We asked for two cups of coffee and his response was simply: ""No coffee on the rooftop"". He was obviously angry and wanted to turn the table. No apology, no explanation, no offers of an alternative. He just walked away fuming. We usually tip at least 20% for good service. We left him nothing.The room design is cool but it's so small that it's hard for two people to move around at the same time. One very uncomfortable bean bag chair to sit in. One worn denim robe. We requested another but it never arrived. I could go on and on but one last thing about prices in the hotel. If you want to mix a small gin and tonic from the minibar, be prepared to shell out $23.00.With so many good hotels in New York, why would anyone stay here?","Key West, Florida","MisterTravel1000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Key West, Florida</strong>",137,1.0

As other travellers have noted, it's cool, hip, funky, etc. but in a part of Chelsea that is still very ""transitional"" (warehouses and car repair shops, a huge housing project just across 10th Avenue). Though only a few blocks away, the Standard Hotel, for example, and the High Line park area where it's located, is worlds apart from this neighborhood. That said, the rates at the Americano, for the ""boutique hotel"" experience you're getting is a great deal at around $250 a night. Still, you'd have to be fairly young and adventurous and city-savvy to make this hotel your base if you're a visitor to NYC.First, the rooms. Very small at around 200 - 250 sq. ft. but well designed with an entire wall that is a window giving the feeling of a much more ample space. Still, the rooms are tiny and not recommended for extended stays. Get the ones on the upper floors (6 and avbove) facing uptown so you get largely unobstructed views of the city. We had room 73, a corner room, which gave us an additional ""transom"" window on the west side. A section of the main window opens for ventilation, a great feature and one that all hotels should have. (I hate being in a hermetically sealed room!). We quite enjoyed the bed on a wooden platform ""ryokan"" style, as the hotel notes. But not so much the cold, hard concrete floor (though there are felt slippers available for use in the closet), or the near absence of shelves or seating (the bean bag is impractical and takes up a lot of space in what is already a small room).I liked the iPad loaded with music and the hotel's app with all the necessary info about the hotel and the neighborhood. But not so much the intermittent quality of the ""Airplay"" feature that kept dropping the wireless music feed into the room's speakers. Finally just ended up playing it through the iPad's tinny speakers.Loved the bathroom amenities, the Aesop bath products, the Japanese wash towel, and the glass shower booth. BUT, and this is a big minus that many others have noted, it's way too dark in there! I would think that aside from this being a huge inconvenience for most people, it would also present a serious liability for the hotel in the event of accidents (after all, bathrooms tend to get wet, slippery, with hard surfaces and metal hardware that are likely to produce serious injuries). Surprised that the hotel's legal counsel wouldn't have already pointed this out.The hotel is fairly new and still seems to be ironing out some rough edges. Some suggestions for the hotel: the sheets are obviously high quality but make sure they are big enough to fit the mattress (the flat sheet for the mattress was too short to stay wrapped adequately around it, leaving my toes to rest uncomfortably on the somewhat scruffy mattress pad that became exposed). Make sure there are two pairs of slippers and and two robes in rooms designed to accommodate two people (only one of each in our room and then had to call housekeeping for the second pair of slippers; did not use the denim robe, though it looked cool, I prefer Frette or simple soft terry).Finally a small gripe with the restaurant, which kept messing up my booking, taking it once for the rooftop bar/grill and then calling back to cancel without a good explanation, and then entirely losing my booking for their restaurant on the first floor, the Americano. The food was fairly good but not extraordinary, considering the considerable competition in this neighborhood. The service was courteous and efficient if not altogether warm and attentive. I would probably eat elsewhere in any of the many fine restaurants in Chelsea or the nearby Meatpacking district next time.I like the Americano overall for what it manages to pack into a fairly small footprint (a lot that is probably 50 x 100) and only about 10 stories including the rooftop (also much smaller in reality than the photos would suggest; the pool is practically a large bathtub), which does offer a nice outdoor space to take in some views of the city while you sip your drink.The hotel staff seems friendly enough, though I didn't really require their services beyond the routines of checking in and out, so it's hard to evaluate. Thought there should be a doorman out in front, just to help with guests coming into the hotel or needing a cab or whatever, but there was none the time I was there.As I said, it's a weird combination of austerity and luxury but one worth trying to see if it suits you.","Seoul, South Korea","jbleenyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",21,4.0

The beds are mega-comfortable, but those who have problems getting down to - or up from - the floor might have a bit of difficulty getting in and out since the beds are on elevated platforms and are quite low. In fact, the ""night table"" is a secret compartment sunken into the floor next to the bed. Very cool use of space.The restaurant area is nice and my yogurt/granola breakfast was delicious.

Most of the staff is very friendly, professional and courteous (although there were one or two snooty ones). There is always good music playing, usually bossa nova or some other lounge-music, which suits the place perfectly. We also had brunch at the hotel on Sunday, when they had a flamenco / bossa nova band playing soothing music, perfect to overcome a killer-hangover.

The hotel itself isn't bad - but there are definitely some things to keep in mind when considering it. The staff members: They were great, ESPECIALLY the guys at the door and the housekeeping staff. One doorman actually ran up the block to 10th to get us a cab, which was really above and beyond. The front desk people weren't quite as great, but one of them helped me out with a map when I asked him. The location: OK but not fantastic - it was a solid 15-20 minute walk to either the subway at 34th or 23rd, and before we got wise to having the cabs drop us off on the corner of 27th/10th or 27th/11th, we got overcharged by them looping around due to the one way streets. The street itself is strange - a Lamborghini dealership next to a high class strip club next to a trendy Italian restaurant. But it was quirky and we liked that it was a little grittier than the heavily touristy areas. And the tasty Italian food directly across the street from the hotel was a definite plus.The hotel: The lobby is nice. The bar was expensive even for NY (probably due to the limited options of anything else nearby), and nothing special. We would have LOVED to check out the rooftop bar and pool area, even just for the views, but it was closed. That was a huge bummer for us, since so much of the advertising for this hotel is based around its awesome rooftop views. If they had the roof open, just at least for those, it would have been nice. The free wi-fi for the whole hotel was a very nice perk, but I also wish there had been a gym (even just a couple treadmills would work) for guests. The room: The rooms are small. But again, that's expected in NY. And, expect to be getting up close and personal with your roommate, if you have one. If I'd been traveling alone, or with my significant other, the room would have been fine. But I was with a friend, and let's just say it's a good thing we're close. This is not the place to stay with people you're not familiar with. There is no desk in the room, just a ledge and a green stool. There are no chairs, except for a ridiculous black patent faux-leather bean bag chair that is terribly uncomfortable and awkward for anyone over 110 lbs. The beds, however, are CRAZY comfy! It's a good thing we were mainly using the room to sleep, because that was one of the best features of the room. There was a decent sized closet, also. The bathroom: The shower has transparent glass walls, and you can see straight through to the toilet if the shower curtain isn't closed. (NOT awesome on the privacy front - this is what I mean when I say expect to get up close and personal with your roommate!) There is NO counter space in the bathroom, with everything that they clutter up the small glass ledge with. There's also nowhere to put your clothes while you're in the shower, except the toilet or the floor. The towels were large and fluffy, and there were enough for both of us, which balanced out the lack of space a little bit. Overall, I don't know if I'd stay at this hotel again. If the price and situation were right, then maybe, but the lack of privacy was a real issue for us.","los angeles, ca","amksba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles, ca</strong>",87,3.0

I try to avoid anything mid-town these days and have opted for smaller, quieter hotels with the hope that I find something that offers the unique combination of style and comfort. When I read bout the Hotel Americano, I thought it seemed right up my alley - decent location near the Highline, from what i could tell a nice aesthetic and design. Prices seemed high but NY prices are always rather exorbitant so I assumed it was just par for the course. But please do not fall into the trap that I did by seeing this hotel on design blogs and assuming it's lovely and amazing. It's nothing of the sort - in fact, it's a Saturday Night Live-worth farce of a hotel. I checked out after only one night and wish I had asked for my money back - it easily goes onto my list of top worst hotels I've had to suffer through. I will say that the overall look and feel of the lobby was actually quite nice. It was a little sparse for my liking but I generally thought it wasn't too shabby. It smelled nice and had a good vibe. Cork stools, etc, are a bit dated but there was a general beauty to the simplicity.The hotel staff all seemed nice enough, but a bit lost and clueless. I felt like they were hired actors playing the part of hotel staff for the most part and dealing with them was extremely frustrating. You'd ask a question and they'd have mostly blank or slightly panicked stares. I chalked that up to the hotel being somewhat new.The room itself, however: Wow. You walk in and realize that the joke is most certainly on you. First off, the lights were controlled by a pen stuck into a hole in the wall. If you even barely nudged the pen, the lights and air control would go off. This grew frustrating in just a few hours when the pen would adjust on its own and you'd be left fumbling around in the dark. There was an inoperative fireplace hanging in the middle of the room, along with a ridiculous bean bag chair that was a glossy plastic that would have done well in art spaces 10 years ago. The sofa was low, too deep to relax in and hard as a rock. The ""chair"" by the ipad chained to the wall was a stool for a supermodel. The bed was frankly the nicest part of the room and even that required rolling out of the bed to get up given how low it is to the floor. Honestly, this place felt like one of those tacky Euro furniture stores where everything is overdesigned and overpriced and generally low quality.The bathroom was a complete joke - and as others have noted, it's basically just poorly constructed all around: from the preposterous length of the shower curtain, to the lack of any shelves to put toiletries, to the postage stamp-sized sink and ridiculous shower that basically was installed incorrectly, allowing people to look in but you unable to see out, to the too-short shower head that forced you to basically stand at the very front of the tub to get the full effect of the shower. Industrial design at its absolute worst.I asked for an ironing board and iron (btw, there is nothing more annoying that not just having one in the room at all times) and 45 mins later it showed up, only to be taken away later that night while I was out having dinner. I called to get one the next morning and it took them another 45 minutes to rustle one up.The elevator was excruciatingly slow, especially in the evenings when the rooftop bar was in full swing. And then there's the noise. You hear EVERYTHING, including a ridiculous elevator for the rooftop partygoers that actually runs right up the front of the building. Every time that sucker rose and fell, you heard it rumbling through the room. And because of the ""comfy"" concrete floors, you heard every echo of the building, every footstep of people outside, every conversation of people in the hallway, every open and close of the door.In short, this is an example of trying to fool people into believing this is what modernism is - it's sad joke foisted on people who have too much money and no taste. Cheap, non-functional, sparse decor masquerading as high design. And poorly designed rooms that may be nice to look at on websites but ridiculously impractical in person. If this is the quality of Mexico that people have come to expect, I feel sorry for those people.",Seattle,"Ryan J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",21,1.0

The bar scene in the lobby was hopping and breakfast at the restaurant in the morning was delicious. The room itself was ok, location a little far west.But never in my life have I had such an UNPROFESSIONAL encounter in New York. My second day I had difficulty getting the door unlocked (yes, they have physical keys and not key cards), a door which had to be yanked open to get out of the room since arrival. When I came down to say I was having trouble, I was not escorted back up but told to try again, sometimes you have to force it a little and if I still had trouble, then they would come help me. When I went back up to 'force it a little' the key quite easily broke off in the lock.This resulted in me be locked out of my room, without access to any of my belongings for nearly 15 hours. The front desk had no idea how to handle the situation. In New York City, where you can get anything at anytime, they insisted there was no one who could help until the engineer arrived at 8am the next morning. For some reason a 24hr locksmith wouldn't do the trick? I was given another room and only after asking was I given contact lense solution (but no case... if I needed a case could I call back to the front desk again?) and a tooth brush. At one point they even asked me if I had tweezers they could borrow to try and get the key out???? No breakfast or coffee offered immediately the next morning. The engineer who was promised to arrive at 8am didn't arrive until after 10am. At no point was a manager available after repeated demands to speak to one. Eventually, after the engineer broke the door, a locksmith was called. The only reason any of this was done was thanks to the kind and attentive doorman, Leonardo.In a City where superior client service is the norm and not the exception, I could not believe that their was not a manager on duty or called in immediately to handle this, nor did the front desk staff seemed to have any sort of training to handle anything more than passing out keys and taking credit cards.It may be hip in the lobby - but it doesn't matter when you've been wearing and sleeping in the same clothes for 15 hours.","London, United Kingdom","anonymous159238</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,1.0

Our expectations were high as we'd experienced their others and we were not disappointed. The design is comfortably contemporary, the rooms surprisingly spacious for a Manhattan hotel and the bath items high quality. One caveat for those who are not supple and limber of body any longer: the beds are on a platform so you have further to pull yourself up than from a regular bed.

Bathroom had a large shower viewable from room, beautifully clad in marble & sleek brushed stainless steel. Aesop toiletries were refreshed daily and smell wonderful.

Clever design of beverage & refreshment area, sufficient storage and closet space in king room.

Stayed only January 11, and checked out.Good Stuff: Nice small lobby, good food at restaurant, staff very courteous. Nice design aesthetic overall; looks nice. The aesthetic is nothing new, however, this look has been around since the early 2000s and is common in Europe, so it is nothing new.Bad Stuff: Location is off; other than a club and modern art galleries, not much to see or do within walking distance. Immediate neighborhood is not yet vibrant like other parts of Chelsea, Tribeca, etc. Rooms are small and designed for single occupancy. Platform bed is too uncomfortable to get into and out of, although mattress is great. No views of anything, room lacks natural light and feels cavernous. Bathroom has no proper sink, but a small hand wash basin, the kind used in Europe at the WC (i.e., half bath tiny hand sink). Shower is enclosed by see-through panels, installed incorrectly: they were probably meant to allow view from shower to room, not the reverse, as is the case. Bed linens are too short (sheets untuck too easily and are insufficient for two), as is shower curtain (short by about 20 cm). Horrendous bean bag chair in room is the only chair in room; there is nowhere to sit or put your stuff on.Food was very good, but a few issues...Staff is not trained, for example, on serving tea: they pour it immediately without allowing infusion, so you get tinted water instead of tea. They put butter on the ""soldats"" (toasted bread sticks) making them mushy and useless when ordering soft boiled eggs for breakfast. Chilaquiles were tasty, but too soupy. They want to play a Franco-Mexican theme, but they need training in both, French and Mexican cuisine and service. What we ate was not bad, however, all the small details that reveal a lack of training. And we are a Franco-Mexican couple, so we can tell.

We'd planned to stay for two nights, but couldn't wait to escape this morning. Now comfortably ensconced elsewhere.Where do I begin to describe the horrible experience we had -- four of us, in two adjacent rooms?Our experience was similar to that described earlier by MaureenColorado. She wrote, ""The hotel's designer seemed to mistake cheap, sparse decor for good design."" Please don't let the photos of the rooms on the hotel's website -- or elsewhere -- fool you. A bare concrete floor looks quite nice in a photo, but actually living in a room with a concrete floor is a bit like sleeping in Costco.There are (essentially) no chairs in the room. The stool beneath the teeny, tiny desk is impractical -- nobody could actually sit on it. And the beanbag chair isn't soft, and doesn't envelop you. You sort of sit against it, rather than in it. Totally useless.So your choice is to sit on the bed -- on the floor. There was a peculiar lamp hanging over one side of the bed, with probably a 20 watt bulb. But the switch for the lamp was on the other side of the bed. The other choice was the florescent light bulbs behind the bed -- but they were incredibly bright, and could not be dimmed. The bed -- essentially on the floor -- was surprisingly comfortable, but the sheets were too small and instantly became untucked.The bathroom was awful. It reminded me of a concrete version of a bathroom on an Amtrak train. Tiny shower cubicle, tiny sink, tiny shelf -- and very weak lighting. The towels were on a shelf at least (and I mean this) seven feet above the ground. I'm 6'2"" and almost couldn't reach the towels. Her Ladyship is 5'6"" and couldn't reach them at all. With so little light in the bathroom there's no way to put on make-up.Although we booked two double rooms, each only had one robe, and one pair of slippers. (Remember the floors are cold, bare concrete.) We had an iPad in our room -- chained to the wall -- but someone had apparently left with the device that charges it, so the battery was all but dead. There was no battery in the clock in my sister's room.We could not control the air conditioning or heating. The rooms had one temperature -- hot.In his reply to MaureeenColorado, Will Jordan wrote, ""should you come back this way again at some point in the future, we will have the stool in your room replaced with a chair from our office."" That's exactly what they finally did for us -- they brought us two desk chairs, vintage Staples. They were comfortable, but hardly gemütlichkeit. The hotel does not have parking. You need to go two blocks downtown -- yourself -- and park your car in a parking lot. This was explained to me ahead of time.Dinner was actually very good, and our waitress was very friendly and efficient. It was the only nice part of our short stay. But we then found we didn't have any hot water in either of the rooms, and at breakfast the next morning we encountered the snooty waitress from hell. Burnt croissants, no cream cheese (I had to send them out to buy some -- which they did, without much grace).The lack of hot water, hotel-wide, put us way, way over the tipping point -- and we checked out a day early. The hotel did not charge us for our stay -- which was gracious of them. Too bad they couldn't give me back a day of my life.Her Ladyship and I have stayed at the Adam & Eve Hotel in Turkey. It, too, has concrete floors and low-down beds -- but somehow it seems to (generally) work at the Adam & Eve, and doesn't work at all here. This hotel is definitely, absolutely NOT for people like us -- in our early 60's. It's not for families. This is a hotel for young couples -- it looks like it's the perfect place for an out-of-the-way assignation. (Who will know you on West 27th Street? I've lived in Manhattan for years, and have never set foot on this block of West 27th Street until yesterday.)But if you're planning an assignation here -- you'd better hope that the lady likes showers rather than baths, likes sleeping on the floor, and doesn't need light in the bathroom to put on her make-up.When we were checking out, the bellman said he was from a Third World Country and the problems we experienced were ""nothing in my country.""

Very small, sleek uncluttered space, with clever touches such as an ingenious trap door in the bed platform, containing the remote and earplugs. Decor is nearly monochromatic down to the polished concrete floor and mostly black/white/stainless furnishings.

Cool looking metal grille across the building front affords privacy while letting in light and the view.

Stylishly appointed but as another reviewer pointed out, that’s not the same thing as stylishly designed. The concrete floors and uncomfortable furniture are less than inviting, and if you frequent boutique hotels when you travel there’s nothing here that you haven’t seen before.On the bright side, there’s a beautiful rooftop terrace with bar service and a seating area cleverly separated by the elevator bank from a small, heated pool and lounge area. The space isn’t lush but it is relaxing and the views are fantastic. The staff members I dealt with from the lobby up to the rooftop were always professional and accommodating.Location-wise if you value being close to the Highline (right next door) and Meatpacking district (kill me), this hotel is ideally situated, otherwise it’s a bit far-flung. Usually hotels this far west compensate with a better price than more centrally located hotels, but not this one.The reason I’m giving Hotel Americano only two stars is because of the inferior construction that I believe went into the building’s renovation. The plumbing is so incredibly noisy, and the walls and doors so incredibly thin that I was besieged with noises all weekend long. The sound of running water behind the walls from other guests using their toilets and showers was as audible as if only a sheet separated our rooms, and every conversation in the hallway, including the SHOUTS for service from housekeeping at 9:30am were enough to keep me on the edge of sleep all weekend. When I weekend in New York it’s a pretty safe bet that both evenings I will be half-drunk, hard to keep awake after 2am, and even harder to wake before 10am that same day. In other words, it takes a lot for me to not get a good night’s sleep, but I could not sleep at Hotel Americano.Along those same lines of bad construction and/or design, the bathroom kind of stank. The drainage and ventilation system were poorly thought out or installed, because the bathroom never dried out. I can brook these unpleasantries in an economy hotel, but it’s unacceptable at this price point.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","chachi69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",46,2.0

They had only been open for a week or so and the level of service and the quality of the food were excellent. We had a party of four, were seated promptly, everyone in the staff was pleasant and professional. I had the steak tartare followed by a grilled duck with figs for the main course and we shared an excellent bottle of red from Oregon. Add two desserts for the table and the check was just over $100 pp with tip and taxes. The Chef has worked at Ducasse and Daniel Boulud's restaurants in the past and some of us were working (or still are) in the food industry and loved our experience there. It's a small space so reservations are a probably a good ideas, while they will certainly take walk-ins. You can make reservations on the hotel website directly via opentable or call them directly.","Los Angeles, California","JonathanDucrest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",114,5.0

The hotel's designer seemed to mistake cheap, sparse decor for good design. Yes they were trying to work with small paces, but aside from the large windows providing light, there was nothing that constituted good design. Lighting was dark in the bathroom, and in the bedroom it was poor. There were no chairs except for an uncomfortable felt-covered stool and a black vinyl bean-bag chair. The hotel had just opened yet already the shower seemed to be backed up and a light was broken. Storage in the bathroom was non-existent. Front desk staff was friendly and felt slippers were provided to shield feet from cold hard concrete floors.",Colorado,"MaureenColorado</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",16,2.0

The hotel is very cool with an excellent rooftop bar.However, you'll either love or hate the rooms. Super modern with an iPad to entertain you in every room. But the concrete floor, bean bag for a chair and somewhat dark atmosphere even with all the lights turned on won't be to everyone's tastes. The bed is low down and more like a fouton but was reasonably comfortable.Biggest problem was a few inexcusable issues with this new hotel. No rail or hangers in my cupboard left me with nowhere to hang my suit! No hair dryer in the room. No coffee in the room, although there was a mini bar. These glitches were pretty annoying for the price but hopefully they will sort them out.The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the rooftop bar closed at 11pm which for such a trendy hotel was a bit annoying when coming back from dinner.Overall, you'll only like this place if you are into super modern hotels and can put up with some of the glitches.

I did however check the other hotels of the same owner and read some articles about the construction etc, and thought it was worth a shot.I'm glad I did, cause the stay was really nice. Loved the rooms, really hip with concrete floor, stylish furniture, low japanese style beds, included iPad, big windows etc. The standard rooms are not very large, but I was travelling alone and did not mind that.Staff (both on premise and contact by email) were super-friendly and helpful. Could not ask for more. It was a very short stay for me, so I did not have time to check out the rooftop pool nor the breakfast. I was told you could borrow bikes as well which I thought was great.First time I stayed in Chelsea but probably not the last. Very close to the hotel was a great nightclub (Marquee), cool restaurant by the river (Frying Pan) and walking distance to Meatpacking area with more nice clubs and restaurants (the Standard etc). Chelsea market is in the area by and the High Line Park runs by the hotel.All in all, highly recommended.",helsingborg,"jarnsater</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>helsingborg</strong>",4,4.0
