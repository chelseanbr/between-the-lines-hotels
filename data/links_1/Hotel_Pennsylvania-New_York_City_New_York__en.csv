However, after some research and seeing bad reviews, I decided to cancel the reservation on January 22. While the cancellation was free, I realized that the hotel already charged my credit card a total of $321.48, or 80% of the room charges as early as January 17. :(I have been following up via email almost every week since January when they would refund the payment that was charged to me, and until now, they have not confirmed when it will be done. I got an email reply twice from Kye Cabalfin (Data Department), but all he said is “Please be advised we have sent an urgent follow up email to our accounting department to assist you further.”I don’t know how much longer it will take them to refund my $321.48! It has been 5 months, and still nothing from them! This is very frustrating!!! What kind of customer service is this? :(",,JoieAura,16,1.0

We arrived at the hotel to find we had no room. So we thought ho hum, there’s a nice reception area here and set up camp on the sofas. We laid down to sleep and there must have been something sharp sticking out of the sofas because it ripped my cagoule. After a rather disturbed nights sleep on the sofas, we went to breakfast. We were promised a continental breakfast, meats and cheeses, a selection of pastries and a choice of tea or coffee. But we arrived to find nothing! Not a sausage. I do not want to complicate matters as in fairness to the hotel, they never promised sausages. So me and my husband had to find food on the pavement outside. I survived mainly on a diet of insects, however my husband had to eat gravel as he is in fact a vegetarian. Not the worst holiday we’ve had but certainly up there.

We finally got to check in and the booking deposits for 2 rooms could not be used and the check in assistant insisted we would be refunded ASAP and paid for 2 rooms in full . 3 days later no refunds of €216 . On day 3 we also discovered we had been charged twice for our rooms .. €445 per room overcharged . Got this refunded at the end of day 4 only to arrive home after 6 days stay to discover they charged me again for the room . Took 5 days to get my all my money back an absolute disgrace.

We were eventually moved to the room we paid for by the next day but this particular room 450, should not be made available to anyone in the freezing condition it was in. The rooms were spacious and clean however the furniture is very very dated and about to fall apart. The rooms could really do with a lick of paint. The breakfast included in the hotel stay was very basic with a fruit pot, pastry and hot drink. For and extra $10 you can have the buffet breakfast and the selection is quite vast with noodles, rice, different kind of eggs, sausages, potatoes, chips and porridge. Staff were friendly but the check in counters are barely manned by people, the hotel management are keen on customers using the self service machines. The queues to the checkin counter is usually very long if you want to speak to a human being. There is an option to leave your luggage at the hotel after checkout at $5 per bag. But again to gain these tags you have to queue up at the main reception. Would have been more convenient and time saving, if the baggage tags were available at the Bell Captain counter which seems to be quiet most of the time.","London, United Kingdom","Alia1979</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

One may stay in the newer side of the hotel, but for the price, the older unrenovated option is still a good consideration. I had a corner king room at the crossroads of 7th and 33rd. The room was cleaner than usual and had a bonus frig.As I was only there for a few days to attend the Westminster KC dog shows, and flying in from Honolulu, I picked the Hotel Penn for it's convenience throughout - Penn Station across the property making commuting in from JFK on the LIRR a breeze and departure back to Washington, DC on AMTRAK. Shuttle buses to the Piers for day shows were contiguous to the property and running consistently to and from. Evening program was at the Gardens so it was a simple walk across the street, all saving precious minutes to do squeeze in other points of interest by train or subway.Most important to me, staying at the Hotel Penn gave me an opportunity to observe how dogs were welcome at this property as I am always looking for properties that accommodate dogs.This centrally located hotel is close to everything - restaurants, POI, shopping, transportation hubs, and an almost 24/7 US Post Office right down the street.The only reason the rating was not a five is because the bathroom was not as complete as it could have been - no face towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap.

I was not going to book there again for my February 2020 trip, but their website said they had 'updated' rooms available for a higher cost than the standard rooms. I was in NYC for the Westminster Dog show and really wanted a hotel close to Madison Square Garden. For that purpose, you cannot beat The Penn. It is right across the street from MSG. Against my better judgement, I booked a King Penn Plaza Collection room for myself and my husband, and a double bed Penn Plaza Collection room for my aunt and her friend. Problems began at check in. My aunt arrived before me and they would not let her check in for her room because I had booked it. Even though my aunt's name was on the room! She finally got them to let her check in, and she goes to her room and can't get in because the key doesn't work. Bellhop goes to get a key that works. He comes back and they open the door to find a tiny King bed room that has the same new furniture they advertised for the Penn Plaza Collection Rooms, but was about half the size of the photos. There was no way for my aunt, her friend, and a dog to stay in the room because they had to be able to set up a crate for a medium sized dog. The room was too tiny to be able to have the crate on the floor and still have room to walk around the bed. In the meantime I am checking in and get the keys to a room with two double beds. Obviously, they just switched who got what room type, but that doesn't take car of the size issue for the dog crate. My husband and I go take the small king bed room, and my aunt goes back to the front desk to get a larger room. They finally get a larger room....with a king bed. OK no big deal, they get a twin bed in to the room and there's enough space for the dog crate now. The small king room is teensy tiny----to be expected in NYC., But there is next to no space to store anything. You can't fit your suitcase under the bed. The closet has about 12 inches of hang bar to use. There is no dresser. Only two bedside tables with a couple small draws. There are no blackout curtains - only flimsy pale colored panels. So no blocking light out. Our HVAC unit was super noisy and rattled.The bottom bed sheet left about 1/4 of the mattress pad exposed and had different hairs stuck all over it.The bathroom was the worst. I have stayed in places with tiny bathrooms all over (Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, Jerusalem, etc). I don't think I have unrealistic expectations for NYC. The toilet didn't really get everything flushed down. The shower stall was the smallest I have ever encountered. It had a fabric curtain, so when you turned on the shower, the whole bathroom flooded. The water temperature was the worst - no matter what you set it on, the water coming out alternated between scalding and freezing. The tiles were broken in places and stained in others. The paint job was so sloppy - the room looked like it had been painted over a million times, and each time was done very poorly so you had globs of paint at some of the edges making the room look very dilapidated. The walls and doors have NO sound proofing. You can hear everything going on in the hall and the rooms next door. All the hotel hallways reeked of marijuana. The Penn could be nice and charming since it was a groundbreaking place when it was built. But it has not been kept up well and the age shows in a bad way. We had four nights booked, but after the first night and the worst shower of my life, we found another hotel to stay at for the rest of our trip. I will say that the manager was very nice and gave us no trouble about refunding us for the unused nights. Proceed with caution about The Hotel Pennsylvania. You can stay other places within a couple of blocks and the same price range that are much nicer.","Tallahassee, Florida","cbg1027</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tallahassee, Florida</strong>",9,2.0

Hotel PA was across the street and appeared to offer a great rate. I booked it - and found out that the posted rate of $68 DID NOT INCLUDE a $35 / night facility charge (WTF?). I found a better deal at a nearby Marriott property and cancelled the reservation with more than the 2 day notice. When I got my credit card bill, there was a charge for the stay, anyway. I have contacted the hotel and they told me that I should not have been billed, but that I needed to call their accounting dept to reverse the charge. I did that, and they don't answer their phone, even during their highly restricted business hours. I emailed them, and they don't reply. I do 70 - 100 hotel stays a year and I have NEVER been treated so badly. I can only imagine how bad my service experience would be if I had actually stayed there.

I stayed on the 16th floor. Although I looked at pictures of the room on the website before booking, there were some discrepancies. First, the carpeting already looks old and had stains on it. The walls needed fresh paint. And the bathroom looked like it hasn't been touched in years (although I will say the bathroom looked clean). Two main issues: (1) the sheets on the bed; and (2) the lack of AC. For the former, when I was getting ready to go to bed, I visually inspected the sheets. Noticed hairs and stains on the sheets. Clearly, the sheets had not been changed. As you can guess, I was disgusted. I ordered new sheets and they were brought up to me. However, I did have to put them on myself. My sleep that night was not great because of this. For the latter, and although I was staying in NYC in February, I was not able to turn the AC on. Room got to be too hot and I was forced to open the window, which brought in way too much outside noise. Nevertheless, for $60, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more.

When we arrived the check in was fairly quick despite the long queue and we went to our room (I cannot remember which floor we was on) but when we got to the room... we was literally waiting for Lady Gaga to rock up and murder us both. The room was small and very dark.. eery!! The whole floor smelt of cigarette smoke aswell. The air con unit in the room was full of dust, the room was incredibly dated and there was a strange mark on the floor that my friend thinks was blood. So we decided to go and have some lunch and think about what we wanted to do.When we returned we decided we wasn’t going to stay in that room to die so I went to reception and asked to move. The lady I spoke to understood completely and offered two other rooms so we went to see both and we was pleasantly surprised! The room we stayed in was so much brighter, cleaner, bigger! The windows were clean which made a huge difference, the bathroom was a lot bigger... not today Gaga.We was so happy that we were given another room I genuinely don’t think that we could have stayed in the first room for 5 nights, Gaga or no Gaga.The hotel has WiFi and a coffee shop in the lobby. If you have breakfast you have to go to a small cafe down the road for a continental breakfast bagel and coffee - we did this once it’s not the best. This hotel is in a brilliant location, literally opposite MSG and a short walk to Times Square, Macy’s etc. As above we booked this due to location and it was reasonably priced too. For the location it’s worth it (if you get a better room that our first one!) the staff were helpful, the security was good, it’s a busy New York hotel but you get what you pay for, it’s not the ritz! Overall I have to say it was a lovely stay! I would def stay here again if next time I visit NYC!

This trip, I needed 14 nights of accommodation and, based on my enjoyable visit last time, I chose Hotel Pennsylvania again. The location is simply unbeatable, being across the street from Madison Square Garden and the major subway station, Penn Station, a short walk to Macy’s, Target, Old Navy, Sephora and many food and beverage options.When I arrived (late at night after 24 hours of travel), the room I had requested was not available. Unfortunately, my experience at this point was far less than satisfactory and not what I had expected since my first stay. Reservations clerk Maria B. really came through for me and went to lengths to ensure I was comfortable, at least until the following day when she put me in touch with Steven Fennell, the Director of Front Office. This man went above and beyond and was determined to ensure my satisfaction which I appreciated enormously. I was finally relocated to a room even better than the one I had requested and will always remember the genuine kindness and professionalism showed to me.In booking my stay, I had unwittingly created some confusion with my bookings and so my account became a bit convoluted. Steven again applied focus to correcting this issue and reassuring me it would all be resolved.As for the hotel itself, it’s an old property and as such, has some ‘character’ that has featured in many, many negative reviews. What people need to remember is that there are two choices when booking Hotel Pennsylvania … the cheaper ‘Classic’ rooms and the higher-priced ‘Penn Plaza Collection’ rooms. The latter are recently renovated and, in my opinion, can’t be faulted. Many of the rooms at Hotel Penn are extremely large, not just by NYC standards but generally speaking.Pay no attention to nasty reviews that mention vermin and other awful things. If you want an excellent place to stay, in the middle of everything (but not in tourist central, Times Square), then choose Hotel Pennsylvania. The wi-fi was 100% reliable and fast, housekeeping and maintenance are responsive and efficient, porters are friendly and there is a 24hr store in the lobby for coffee, snacks and drinks. There is a large gathering area on each floor for meetings or social get-togethers, and an ice machine and vending machine on various levels. Hot water and water pressure were good, my bed was exceptionally comfortable and clean, rooms are serviced daily and the heating system was efficient and worked well. Large screen TV even offers Chromecast.Special mention to my lovely housekeeper Iris who was warm, friendly and did a great job every day. Much appreciated.When booking at Hotel Pennsylvania, if you intend to spend a decent amount of time in your room, invest a little extra and request a Penn Plaza Collection room. If you intend to simply lay your head down at night and spend the rest of your time exploring New York City, then keep in mind that this is an old hotel and you truly do get what you pay for and if only sleeping there, then it represents good value for money. Meanwhile, the hotel is undergoing a gradual transformation so in time, all the rooms will be of the same, much better standard.I will definitely be back next time I’m in NYC.",Brisbane,"foodometer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",5,5.0

Honestly, the staff are pretty good too, but I feel for them...working in such a gong show. You need to request everything twice, at least, and even then, you might not get it...like a bath tub plug, but instead get a cocked on strainer over the drain while out exploring! Or a proper blanket, good luck...beds are comfy enough,but don't expect a proper blanket or duvet on it.We moved rooms 3 times in 24 hrs, and it's not because we are picky, we have stayed in all sorts of places, and worked in hotels over the years, but never anything like this nutty place...anyway we had water issues in our first room, meaning dark brown greasy water pouring out due to a maintenance issue, and then again for getting put into unfinished rooms. The staff did their best to work with what they have,but it ain't much! Shout out to Maria on front desk, she was literally the only reason we kept our week long booking here. Nothing really was done properly, in their refurbished rooms, so layer of bathtub coming off as you run water, wall paint all over carpet and drips down walls. It's sad, because this hotel obviously was spectacular, but clearly not enough put back into it.It smelled like weed every day in the hallways. When you get the breakfast you feel like you are lining up for daily rations or something.

The next day, after multiple complaints I was moved to the king room after 7pm. The room had bed bugs but the management didn’t bother doing anything about it. The toilet did not have warm water and they didn’t do anything about it.I had no option but to check out. The manager was rude and over charged me while I was clearly suffering at this property from day one. Over all: Not worth your money. The lobby, the rooms and the toilets are in bad shape. I suggest you walk into this property and have a look before booking. Pay attention to the absence of cleaning. It is filthy. Found bags full of trash in the elevators (photos attached). I wouldn’t recommend this property even if it is the last place that has a room to offer in the city. Look for other options near by. Check in and check out will take forever.

This was our first time coming down to see a NY Rangers game and stay over night. The staff was not helpful and our room was pretty dismal and not at all nice. We thought we would give them a second chance since we knew that Hotel Penn was renovating and making changes. I am glad we did. My wife and daughter were much happier and enjoyed being in New York and doing some shopping. Our room was clean, modern furniture, the room had lots of open space, the room was much brighter, and the bathroom was clean. The staff person was helpful on our express check-in and gave us our tickets for continental breakfast and complimentary drink tickets to Feile or Stout. The continental breakfast was at Cafe-R outside of the hotel and down the street a little ways. The breakfast consisted of a large fruit cup, bagel or (muffin,danish), and a drink (water, coffee, juice). This worked very well for us and it was well stationed to handle the people coming through. The family was happy. We attended the Rangers game at MSG and lost the game in the last 26 seconds of the 3rd period. A real let down! After the game we went to the Irish Bar Stout and used our drink tickets and that put back a positive spin back onto the evening events. Overall my girls were happy with the shopping, the Hotel turn around, and were a little disappointed in the Rangers loss. The beauty of it for us was that we took Amtrak down from Syracuse to Penn Station, you walk across the street to your Hotel and MSG is right there across the street. No hassles and very easy.

Especially MARIA, she did our check-in and upgraded us to a newer room, then when we talked to her about the room being cold she immediately called management and solved the issue. People like Maria make a huge difference in your perception and experience. It doesn´t matter how new and cool a place is if the staff sucks.Bottomline this place has the best location and amazing staff.

What I was given was an old room! When I went back to the counter the lady argued with me and was very rude telling me she gave me a room on the 10th floor which was part of the PPC. I politely told her that the room was not upgraded. She then went to a manager and said the manager approved my move to the 11th floor. The room was modern and updated than the one on the 10th floor. Rooms are very cold so ask for extra blankets. The towels feel stiff...so you may want to bring your own face/wash cloths. If you are taller than me (5') and weigh more than me (135lbs.) good luck sitting on the toilet. It is so close on the left to the wall and the toilet paper holder is literally touching your side.

Location is amazing! Right across from Penn Station so if you are needing to go to the airport the LIRR is right there. Also it is next to the 34th st subway station so everything is easily accessible. Secondly, it appears that they are little by little renovating the building as some floors outside the elevators have nice furniture in them and some look completely sad as the carpet is being warped from years and years of use. We arrived on a Thursday and checked in to go to our room on the 15th floor. Once we Exited the elevator at the 15th floor it looked pretty sad and I did not have a good feeling about our short two night stay here. We opened the door to our room and it was just like I thought, a sad and forgotten tiny little space that did not smell nice at all. Dingy bathroom and what appeared to be holes in the bottom of the wall was all it took for me to tell my wife to hold on while I go speak to someone about upgrading. All this to say: MARIA IS AMAZING!!!! I went downstairs and asked Maria if there was any way I could upgrade and she let me know that they were all booked and to try in the morning again.

There was a constant line at the front desk, day and night, with travelers checking in. Everyone we met that works there came across as indifferent and would rather be somewhere else. There was supposedly a pool, but I never saw where it was and we didn't bother since it stated on the website nobody under 18 allowed in (really??). No restaurant either.A portion of the rooms have been renovated (which I can't speak for) and a portion are VERY old and decrepit. We stayed in an older suite, but I'm not complaining. Why? There were 5 of us in our party (my wife and I and our 3 teen children). For $330 a night, I was able to get a 3 bedroom / 3 bathroom suite which was HUGE. There was a newer TV in each bedroom and also in the sitting area. There was also a big (old) dining room table. This total space must have easily been 1,200 SF. In midtown Manhattan. Across the street from Madison Square Garden. For $330/night.The ceilings were 12' with great views (old drafty windows). The beds were newer and comfortable. Everything else was old, worn and desperate need of replacing. The first night, I called downstairs needing a few more blankets and pillows (I called at 11:30). When it got to 12:00 and nobody showed up yet, I called again and immediately received a dose of NYC attitude that the guy was 'busy'. He actually knocked on our door at 2:00 AM with the pillows and blankets. The handrail in our tub was half pulled out of the wall, the cold water handle in the shower was broken, so you had to be fast with your shower and we had mismatched (and loose) interior door knobs, chipped paint, damaged baseboards and trims. The hotel clearly could care less about routine maintenance of these older rooms. In so many ways, you would call this room a dump (maybe no longer up do NYC building code??), BUT, it was 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms for $330 a night in Manhattan. Would we stay there again? Yes. We could even travel with another family and stay in a single room. BUT, we would only return with others that have a similar mindset on a NYC room. We spend most of our time out in the city and only come back to sleep and shower. There can't be another hotel still like this in midtown. Being able to walk from Penn Station was a huge plus, for we came into the city on Amtrak. The location was perfect.If you know what you are getting yourself into, you should be fine. The ironic thing is, I don't think I'd want to stay in one of the newer rooms if they are postage-stamp small based on the rest of the hotel and the demeanor of the staff. The service in the hotel was so-so at best and I'd only want to come back if it meant getting one of these monster suites for a steal.","Upper Arlington, Ohio","ohio-brad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Upper Arlington, Ohio</strong>",28,3.0

But is just that. 1st of all, when we started the check in, the lady the was doing it for us said that they did not have king size bedroom, although I made the reservation 20 days before the trip and I’ve chose the king size bedroom and also payed for l the 1st day in it since a week before. It was very disappointing and we were so exhausted from the trip... then she said “let me check with my boss if we have a king size bed” and after a couple minutes waiting, she said “ok, we have it”. It sounded like our reservation was not important and we were being treated like some “walk in” that just tried a hotel night. But no, I made a reservation in a good advance time. They showed how disorganized they are since this time. After that we went to the bedroom, which is ok. The bedroom sheets were ok but not smelling softer. Also, the bed seemed more queen size than king size. Then we left the room to buy some stuff and the when we got back, the key card did not work and we got locked outside of the room. We went back to the reception and we got new key card, which, again, did not work. At this point, we were so exhausted and we called security. The security guy helped us and then, just after all this issues, we got inside the room. Caution with the free breakfast and park: the breakfast is served in other restaurant, outside the hotel and they let you eat just one pastry (bread, English muffin, croissant) and one beverage. If you want to upgrade it, you have to pay 10 extra dollars and the price of the breakfast without the voucher that the hotel gives you, is 11 dollars. In this case, it’s completely unnecessary the voucher, because the breakfast included in the room rate it’s too poor!! Also, the hotel does not have a park. They send you to park in other parking and you have a discount (20 dollars less if park by yourself) from the regular price. Note: the park is not far away from the hotel, but it’s not too close and also, it’s uncomfortable carry luggage in the middle of NYC streets to get there. Be sure you can do it (do not take to much weigh) and you’ll be fine. Overall, it’s just ok (nothing especial or really good) Do not expect much because it’s a cheap hotel.",,raissaantunes,0,3.0

Our room was on the 15th floor and I don’t think I have ever stayed in such a run down room . It was clean , that is the only positive thing I can say . Paint peeling on walls and ceiling . Hot water but awful bath tub. Very small room . I would never book here again but location is good and if booking , make sure it is an upgraded room. We weren’t aware of this . Chaotic reception but this k this is the same for all city hotels at this time of year . Lady called Betty at reception was very polite and helpful at bookout .

Additionally, we received breakfast vouchers for a free bagel or pastry, mixed fruit and a drink (coffee or juice).

We arrived during a busy Christmas-season Saturday and we queued up to check in, like at an airline counter. But the line moved fast. Our room was not ready--it was 3pm and checkin is at 4--but I was not feeling well and the amazing desk clerk got me water and a cold cloth, then talked to her manager and got us into our suite with little delay. The desk clerk's kindness and sensitivity set the tone for our visit. Finding our room was a bit crazy--rooms with the letter A are in the annex wing, just keep walking past the rooms without an A and we finally found ours. We had a 2 room suite. The rooms were both very very large. The living room had a sofa bed, a chair, and a TV--no other furniture, no table to sit at, no side table...just kind of barren. The bedroom was nicely equipped, the bed comfy, the sheets sweet-feeling, and the bathroom was comfortable, with subway tiles setting a nice tone. The room was very very clean (as was the hallway as we approached our room). The heat control was not ideal--off or on, the temperature regulator didn't really change the setting--but the room warmed up to a nice temp. Our windows overlooked 7th St/Madison Square Garden, lovely to people watch from our 10th floor window seat (a bit noisy at night with city sounds, though!). Breakfast the next morning (included) was a continental style across the street at a local cafe. The large fruit cup was delicious, the pastries tasty, and the coffee wasn't terrible. Good deal! All in all, we had a great stay and it's clear that the hotel is working hard to overcome its poor ratings over the years. We can recommend this hotel if you're in a renovated room.","New York City, New York","rmwhitt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",200,4.0

This is an older hotel The hotel is centrally located in mid town Manhattan and is right across the street from Penn Station. We ended up taking a NJ transit train in from Hamilton, NJ to NYC Penn Station. The hotel is also right across the street from Madison Square Garden. We were in town to see Pentatonix in concert in the Hula Theater within Madison Square Garden.The hotel is close to many area restaurants and there is lots of shopping. The Macy's flagship store is just 2 short blocks away from the hotel. There is also a nearby Target and Old Navy. Times Square is about a 9 block walk or you can take a taxi or subway. Rockefeller Center is about 8 or 9 blocks away and the Empire States Building is within 2-3 blocks of the hotel. The hotel is close to subway stations as well. Subway fares are $ 2.75 each way as of 11/19 and we had a metro card for the subway that we preloaded with funds.The hotel offers a few different room types including rooms with 2 twin beds, 2 double beds and they even offer a 3 bedroom suite as well. Hotel has free high speed wi-fi. We had no issues connecting to the wi-fi. There are 1,700 guest rooms at the hotel. There is the City Perks café that is open 24 hours in the lobby area. The hotel is pet friendly as well. The hotel also has a fitness center for guests even though we did not use it. The hotel also offers banquet facilities for events, etc.We had two suites with two twin beds in each. Both rooms had views of this huge electronic billboard right across the street. We had to shut the curtains at night as the bright light would shine through and keep us awake. Our rooms were small but comfortable. The rooms were also clean. There is a desk int he room and flat screen television as well. The closet has an iron, ironing board and luggage rack. The beds were comfortable for the most part but very noisy with the sounds of the springs. I feel the mattresses should be replaced with better ones.The service was ok. There were long lines to check in and out.The bathroom was nice and the shower stall had a curtain to pull shut. Shower pressure was good.Hotel offerered free breakfast voucher for one day to Cafe R which was located on 32nd Street between 6th and 7th avenue. The voucher entitled guests to 1 pastry(bagel, muffin, croissant or danish), choice of 1 beverage (coffee, orange juice an water) and fresh fruit.Breakfast hours are 6:30am to 10:30am. We elected not to use the free voucher and we went to the nearby McDonald's for one breakfast. There was also a nearby Starbuck's (next to the hotel) where we went for our 2nd breakfast while in NYC.Room prices were 200 + per night with AAA rate.Overall, the hotel was nice and convenient to many different things in NYC and we would visit again.","Willow Grove, Pennsylvania","Keith F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willow Grove, Pennsylvania</strong>",237,4.0

Check in was a breeze and took only a few minutes. Staff is friendly. You need to show your hotel key to security when taking elevator to your room. Upon entering 14th floor there is a nice lobby area with a huge tv, couches, chairs and table in which you can relax. My room was renovated, clean, and comfortable. Room had one king size bed which sleeps two perfectly ! The room had no closet door and the only other problem was the tub water had a yellowish color which was not good. Had to run the water for hours before it turned clear. Not sure but maybe rusty pipes caused the discoloration. We were out all day the following day and upon arrival back to our room to rest up (around 4:00 pm ) the room was not made up so I had to get a hold of housekeeping to make the beds and clean room. Dorthia was quick to respond and was ready to jump in and make sure our room was up to par ! The hotel is located in a awesome location ! Right across the street from Penn Station and steps away from Macy’s and Times Square ! There is Manhattan Mall around the corner from hotel which has 4 floors but only 2 are in operation with the biggest store being JC Penney. Across from mall is Target and down the street a K-Mart. Spent time at the Color Factory which was amazing and fun ! Went to the Brooklyn Bridge which if you take a taxi from hotel to bridge it costs about $12.00. You could also take the subway which is a much lower fare. Soho is close by to Brooklyn Bridge, the walk to Soho is not long and once there you have the option to shop at many stores and get a bite to eat at Starbucks. There are many restaurants and cafe’s as well. Shake Shack is a fast food place that has awesome burgers and cheese fries ! I had a strawberry milkshake which tasted awesome as well ! Hotel being steps away from Rockefeller Center we engaged in some Christmas events. The enormous Christmas tree is a must see for everyone along with all the Christmas decorations that fill the city ! I must of took a couple thousand pictures of everything I explored capturing all the beauty of New York City ! The hotel is a great place to stay but make sure you get a renovated room and one which is located on a higher floor. I believe the hotel has 18 floors. We stayed on the 14th floor. There are a few shops and coffee shop in hotel but no restaurant. They do have room service which is brought in from an restaurant outside the hotel. We gave room service a try and had no problem, the service was quick and food came hot. You get your moneys worth on the food which I couldn’t even finish due to the bacon burger being so huge accompanied by a large amount of french fries, a pickle, and cole slaw.The menu offers a lot of variety; there is a lot to choose from the menu.All and all my daughter and I had a wonderful and fun filled time !!","Los Angeles, California","Caleeco21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,4.0

I wasn't happy he said we could have an refurbished room and as we didn't get what we were expecting he gave us a room with 2 queen beds and he gave us 10 tokens for a free continental breakfast,( coffee porridge or large pot of fresh fruit, bagel and a pastry it was very nice,but we found out if you pay $10.89 for upgrade they gave you 1 small and 1 large plate to fill with what ever you wanted from buffet which was out of this world it had all sorts even pasta meat balls chinese foods and sushi and 4 different coffees or juices it filled us til late afternoon ) we could have our room right then so we were very happy. We paid the $250 dollars tax!! This is expected in most hotels apparently but some its included you really should check as this doubles Original price.. the room was on 14th floor each had beautiful huge foyer by the 12 lifts yes 12 6 either side, with huge seating area a projector screen showing the news.

Warning you now to stay the h*ll away from this establishment!!!! When we first checked in they put us in a room on the 10th floor, which had a leaking toilet leaving water on the bathroom floor, no fitted sheet on the mattress, only a random sheet draped over the bed, the shower would randomly get scolding hot to the point where it would burn two adults. The thermostat was in a dirty hole that was in-operable. The “newly renovated room” had cracks all throughout the molding, I think a Motel 6 would have been nicer.. after being fed up with issues, I decided to make a call to the front desk and get it taken care of. The manager then tried to make it right by moving us to a suite on the 17th floor. He then told us that a bellhop would be up with luggage help, which he brought nothing with him to carry our luggage and shortly left after giving us our new key card. after getting onto the 17th floor and seeing the room, we were impressed and thankful that the manager tried to make the situation better, UNTIL My fiancé and I were laying in bed and I got a notification for a charge for $800 that my bank had marked as potential fraud. before going down to the desk, I called Chase to get more information, which then they informed me they tried to charge my card $800, $750, $700, $650, $600, $550, $500, $450, $400, $350, and so on. At this point we were livid. we walked down to the desk to assess the situation and the manager acted clueless and said that we should look at the room we were initially in to see why they had charged us. My fiancé and I followed the security guard and the manager to the 10th floor room, ready to show them all of our issues that we had initially complained about. When they unlocked the door, our jaws dropped after seeing a smashed TV that was untouched when we left. they said that we were the only ones that had been in and out of the room, but somehow they tried to charge us for a broken TV that they wouldn’t have known of if no one had been in the room. We asked to see security footage of the hallway, which they did not let us see or give us any additional information. not to mention, the door didn’t even fully shut unless you slammed it in the first place, so really anyone could have been in and out after we had left the room. We had to get NYPD involved, which side note, the police completely agreed that the hotel had no right to charge us and that it seemed like the TV had been damaged by hotel staff and the staff was possibly afraid to lose their job blamed it on it’s customers. in return, the manager was upset that the police were agreeing with us and asked us to vacate the premises at 10:15 in the evening after we had already paid in full for four nights. This facility is extremely unprofessional, rude, and filled with slimy and disgusting individuals. this place is a joke and I feel bad for their staff being so afraid to lose their job that they feel the need to lie and blame a customer. I have attached a picture of the damages of the TV to show you how it was smashed. One thing to add to the argument, is the only thing that was moved in the room from the time we left to when security brought us back up to the room, was a steel luggage rack that could’ve easily damaged the TV, that was folded up about 3 feet from it.

One drink per person per stay at an offsite pub only good after 7:30 pm. Daily “breakfast”, a beverage & a pastry at an offsite food court. Exercise & swimming, also off-site. Decent wi-fi, but they don’t tell you about the secret access code unless you ask. Our room on the 10th floor had some newer furniture, but apparently they didn’t get around to installing a credenza or chair. The room was mostly empty floor space. On day 1 we got two hand towels and one washcloth; day 2 just two hand towels and no washcloths; and on day 3 one hand towel only. There was no way to regulate temperature in the room.

I'm a frequent business and personal traveler and my expectations are fairly flexible - especially when trying to save money. But this place was the most horrible hotel experience I've had in the last decade.I and several members of my company were all staying here due to its proximity to The Javits Center. The automated checkin kiosks seemed to be working, but after 11 minutes of struggling through the menus, they weren't able to issue keys. So, we all had to wait over 2 hours and 10 minutes just to check in at the desk. The first problem was that there was a huge line and sometimes only a single clerk. The second problem was that everybody who got a room assignment was coming back down, jumping the line, and demanding a new room.Once we were finally checked in, we expected the rooms which were shown on the hotel website and promised by our travel agent. But, we were given rooms which were approximately 1/4 to 1/3 the size, certainly less attractive, and lacking almost every amenity. I'll attach pictures to this review. Three of my colleagues had to change rooms multiple times just so they could get rooms without MOLD - which was clearly visible on the walls and ceiling. My room had a disgusting ventilation system, but I was too tired to try and switch it out until the second night. It's clear that the pictures on the website were NOT the rooms which most people get assigned. It was also clear the front desk staff didn't care.In the elevator lobby, there were signs which read that you must show a key to gain access. There was a guy in a hotel uniform posted there, but he wasn't checking anybody's keys and at times, he was even asleep. The lack of security was evident by the fact that there were two hookers roaming around on my room's floor - knocking on doors and making offers. When I reported this, the so-called security guy didn't even pretend to be concerned.Many of the rooms come with a ""free breakfast."" But it turns out that this is just coffee/juice and a muffin at a nearby (and somewhat hidden) deli. There is no food or restaurant in the hotel itself. So, we had to head out into the rain just to get our measly free food.I and my colleagues stopped by the front desk multiple times, to speak with a manager. Whenever we did, we were rudely told that either no manager was on duty or none were available to speak with us.If you are tempted by this hotel's website and/or prices, I beg you to do yourself a favor and look elsewhere - even if you need to stay in a local youth hostile or sleep on a bench in Central Park. Don't believe what you see on this hotel's website.","Orange County, California","RicsOpinions</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",3,1.0

We have positive and negative experience. Don't be fooled by the photos that you see in their website. The property has several buildings connected to each other. Some suites have been renovated and others not an the bathroom is really tiny. At check in, the front office staff was very nice and gave us our room key. When we got to the room, instant disappointment, it started the moment we open the squeaking door, musty smell with a very old filthy ripped carpet, bathroom tub rusty and you don't even want to step in it-every thing is old and really tired. I took some photos. So we dash back to the front office and was begging if he can release us from our four nights stay but he insisted that unfortunately, he cannot do that and we would lose our money. He did in fact, offered to move us to a room in the renovated floor and because we were so dead tired from travelling, we just gave in. the room has view of 1/2 of the tower of the Empire State. the room was freezing cold and the thermostat cannot be adjusted. for the cost of the room that they charge, we could have stayed comfortably in another hotel. Our reservation included breakfast and you have to ask for the vouchers. the restaurant is not on site so you have to get out of the hotel and walk close to a block. We were ill treated in their designated restaurant, most of the staff were rude and just because we queued for a ""free"" breakfast of fruit, pastry and coffee or juice, it does not mean that we were at their mercy. $5 charge for each luggage storage should be complimentary. this was my first trip to NY and having spent a few days there, I now have found other possible hotels that will provide me with a much better hotel accommodation. I just feel so bad for other guests that have come from all corners of the world that have stayed in the suites that were not renovated but paid for the costs of the room that it was not worth the penny.. some of them may come back to NY but probably like me that will never come back to The Penn Hotel. it was the front office staff that checked us in that made the difference. so Pennsylvania Hotel, your proximity to Madison Square Garden, Macy's=,Penn Station, the Broadway to name a few is convenient but please try to renovated your rooms for your sake and the sake of your future guests..","Edmonton, Canada","Ahj G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",4,2.0

So before booking anything, web search how much your hotel could change you on top of the listed prices. This is not a local tax (that is extra) merely but a method of adding to your bills for items such as use of the lifts, phones, etc. HotelThe hotel is massive with 1700? rooms, and is a local landmark due to it’s scale and corner location. It is sort of extended “E” shape. The exterior architecture, reception area and lift lobby show signs of past Art Deco glamour. The other areas and corridors, having been or are in the process of upgrading in various styles of the fashion of that time. With some floors appearing refreshed others not. The fellow guests appeared mainly to be American student groups or foreign tourists. There was always a long queue at reception, I arrived very late and had to wait about 20 minutes to check in. Overall my stay was a functional experience except breakfast, which could be deeply unpleasant. Breakfast was taken across the road in a buffet restaurant. Guest were given tokens for either the buffet (heavy fried items of low quality) or continental; plastic box with chopped melon, sweet sauce, choice of sweet item like muffin, croissant, etc. and choice of small weak coffee, bottle of water or juice. Pick the wrong time and very crowded and noisy. Go early or best avoided due to angry people who seem to be expecting the buffet. I would not take either option but it was included in the price. However I would sometimes skip and go to the nearby Pret café for (much) better coffee and environment or Macy’s back garden square if sunny.RoomMy room was an “unfurnished” double on the 14th floor. No view as such as was inward facing so looking at other hotel wing room windows. The room was a good size for New York and had a spacious bathroom. There was: a double bed, two side tables with large table lights, desk and chair with another lamp, wardrobe, a small safe and small TV. It was cleaned daily but the walls and woodwork were covered in marks and the furniture was chipped. It felt “tatty” for the price. The room had no art deco features apart from an original chipped bathtub and some old floor and wall tiles. The room, furniture and bathroom needed an refresh. Note I did not ask for a room exchange, as the desk queue was always bad. The room “facilities” charge was an extra 218 US Dollars for the whole stay.AreaGreat location at corner of 34 St and 7th Ave. Sit directly above subway for up/down town at 34 St/Penn Station and opposite Pennsylvania Station for trains for JFK airport and Washington DC, bus stop at side for uptown. Next to Macys and easy access to the High Line garden. In walking distance for most common uptown and downtown sites. Overall the area was full of low-grade tourist shops/eateries with limited options of quality. Only the food court in Penn. Station stood out – not cheap but at least food was cooked to order. The small garden at the back of Macy’s for better coffee or (when raining) the local Pret et Manger for decent cheap coffee and view of the Empire State from the window stools. Crowds stuck to 7, 8 and 9th Avenues so could be walked around and the area felt safe. Tourist touts outside hotel but no problems were obvious. BadTatty, unfurnished room, groups of students eating supermarket/takeaway food in the lift areas, long queues for reception, high “facilities” charge.Traveller TipOnly accept a refurbished room. Ask for an outside view facing room if you want a view. Using bankcards was a problems as the area likes cash for anything under 20$ US.Hotel TipContinue the new refurbishment in a single style i.e. art deco repro. The mis-match detracted from the upgrade. Have an eating lounge for the students. To maintain room standards have a monthly room wall and woodwork cleaning program.Would I stay again?Great location but boring area but no. It did not offer value when the “facilities” change was added and at times it felt like a hostel.

Unfortunately, this is the only positive point I can share and is the reason I can give, at the most, one rating.The hotel lobby with the Christmas tree and decorations, which are very tasteful, is passable and of decent appearance. The front desk staff are unwelcoming, unhelpful, unfriendly and have an appearance as unkempt and tired, as the hotel.I stayed with family, a party of eight for four nights; we had three rooms between us. Each of our rooms were of the same, awful standard. We were on the 15th floor and the sight that met us when stepping out of the lift was quite disgusting; the carpet in the hallway is not only dirty but full of stains and only worthy of going into the nearest skip! The room doors are all damaged and in a poor state, an extremely unwelcoming sight. The rooms are quite filthy and the carpets only slightly better than the hallway; I didn’t feel comfortable walking bare foot in the room. The bedsheets seemed clean but the same cannot be said of the blankets and bedspreads. The beds are rickety and seem quite old. The bedrooms all have a flatscreen tv, however, I would prefer to see a decent carpet and money spent on decor. On a positive note, after the first night we asked housekeeping for extra pillows, these were delivered to the room quite promptly.There are so many original features in the hotel that, I feel, with some tlc and efficient maintenance Hotel Pennsylvania could be quite beautiful, unfortunately, at the moment, it is a glorified hostel.It amazes me that a hotel of this size doesn’t have its own restaurant or bar; going out of the hotel to a cafe down the road isn’t ideal and the breakfast in the cafe is far from ideal. The staff almost threw the breakfast allocation onto our plates and the hot drinks were lukewarm.Although we didn’t stay in the hotel for any length of time and only used our rooms for showering and sleeping it would’ve been nice to have a clean room and the furnishings and decor to be of a higher standard, especially as the price paid was by no means the cheapest in Manhattan.I will not stay here again, at least until I know there have been renovations made to the rooms, doors and hallways. I would also not recommend this hotel to anyone, as it currently stands.","Cloyne, Ireland","michelle0166</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cloyne, Ireland</strong>",3,1.0

It was disgusting and looked like something from terror towers! When I asked for a new clean room I was asked if I wanted to upgrade! No I didn’t want to upgrade I wanted a clean room like I had paid for! We got a new room on the 4th floor which was better but not great! We had no hot water on the first night and the hot tap in the sink didn’t work but I was not going through another room change! The location is great but the noise was a bit much. The free continental breakfast consists of “one trip down the buffet line” in which you are given 1 fruit cup, 1 bagel or muffin and 1 drink, (tea/coffee or a fruit drink!) might I add that the breakfast is served in a cafe down the road and isn’t actually in the hotel, the cafe is crowded as serves the public also and you will struggle to get a seat, we collect our breakfast and took back to our room each day. After day 5 you get a bit sick of eating the same thing everyday as the fruit cup never changes from melon! On the last day they had run out of bagels and were serving hard bread even though there was plenty bagels left for the paying customers?! They were even running low on muffins so cut them in half!! If you do stay here I recommend upgrading and not having the breakfast but bear in mind this hotel is very dated and the carpets on the floors are disgusting.

The hotel staff was friendly, and our room was clean and comfortable. The room also had free WiFi.The room we reserved came with vouchers for a free continental breakfast at Cafe R a few doors down. We found the restaurant to be crowded, but they got us through the ""Hotel Penn Breakfast Line"" quickly. We each received one free fruit cup, a bread product (muffin / bagel, etc) and juice OR coffee. For $10, you could upgrade to one trip through the hot buffet line, but the listed price for that experience was only $11, so I think you're better off with the free breakfast personally.During our stay, we were able to take advantage of the fitness & business centers, as well as some of the nearby shops & attractions. This hotel is located directly across the street from Madison Square Garden & Penn Station, so getting around was easy *except* for trying to catch an Uber on 32nd or 33rd street in the evening.

I booked one of the ""renovated"" rooms and I have to admit the rate was good considered NY standards. The check-in took forever, after a long flight from Europe, to enter the hotel and see an endless line of people is not the best start. Each front desk operator seemed to be particularly slow. And as a matter of facts, when it was our turn, things started to get even slower: I booked my room about 2 months in advance and the front desk agent started to look on his computer and roll his eyes... We asked what it was wrong and he replied that our room was not ready (it was 4pm!). He tried to give us one of the older rooms which I refused. Then he tried to give us a king bed when we needed two separate beds. He finally went in the back office and talked to the manager and he found a room of the same category we expected. But the story is not over yet: when I gave my credit card for incidentals, we were told that we must have the same card used for booking the room, which was not ours, since the hotel was booked by our office. After further discussions he then refunded the original credit card and charged my personal with the whole amount. I can see why they have this policy but it was not written anywhere otherwise we would have been prepared for!

Our room was extremely quiet, we were in an interior room instead of street side; we could only hear street noise when there were sirens. That’s the main reason we stayed in the room instead of asking to be moved. The accessible room was very large. Breakfast vouchers.... you only get 2 per person per room (although we stayed for 4 nights). The restaurant was a 2 minute walk outside the hotel, but you got a beverage (small juice, or tea or coffee), a pastry (bagel, croissant or danish) and a tall cup of fresh fruit (cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew and pineapple). Service was quick and easy. Price: despite the money we paid ($360 Canadian a night), it was still cheaper than most hotels in the area. CONS:We Paid a little extra for the mid range Penn 5000 room which was supposedly renovated in 2019. On entering the room we were taken aback immediately by the decor.... no pictures on the walls, old shabby furniture and no comforters on the beds. I felt like I was in a military barracks, although they’re nicer than the Penn. It was quickly apparent that the room had NOT been renovated, (see pictures) but we had asked for an accessible room, and it was very quiet and we were anxious to hit the streets of NYC, so we didn’t complain immediately. That night as we were preparing for bed we realized that the toilet was leaking. Someone came up immediately, but the repair job, while adequate, left the room looking even worse!! We took a box of Kleenex from between the two towel racks in the bathroom and realized that the box had been placed there to hold the top rack, which promptly fell down. There was no way to moderate the temperature of the room, and if you opened a window it was near impossible to close again without climbing up on the window ledge and standing on the window lip. (We got the toilet repairman to close it when he came and didn’t open it again) There was no hairdryer, ironing board, or safe in our room, although the website said we would have all three.

Completely UNACCEPTABLE!My friend was in town from Japan and was staying at this hotel in early October. I was in the room with him around midnight, and out of nowhere part of the bathroom ceiling came crashing down! There was heavy sheetrock and dirt scattered all over the floor. His toiletries and clothes in the bathroom were covered in dirt and dust. If either of us had been in there at the wrong time, we could've been injured.We were in absolute shock that something like this would happen. We phoned hotel services and the woman on the phone seemed genuinely concerned and told us to go straight to the front desk and ask to speak with the manager.My friend isn't fluent in English, so he wanted me to explain to the staff what had happened and get (at least some of) his money back. I tried telling the woman at the desk that I needed to speak with a manager, but she rolled her eyes and told me that she was dealing with a customer (although that customer had just walked away). I had to wait for the other employee to finish dealing with someone (about 10 minutes) before I could ask him to get me the manager.Another ten minutes later the manager, an African-American guy with glasses, comes out, doesn't acknowledge my friend or myself and proceeds to print out new room keys. He hands them to us and tells us to move our stuff to this new room.NO APOLOGY.I tell him, ""Wait wait wait. The ceiling just freaking fell onto all his stuff in the bathroom. You're not going to offer him his money back or at least apologize?""The man answers, ""Well you can either take the room, or you can go stay at another hotel."" At midnight? What kind of manager is this? I become indignant and demand that he give my friend his money back, and the guy smugly tells me, ""you're just arguing with yourself at this point.""Anyone who stayed in that room was in danger of having sheetrock fall on their head, and the manager doesn't seem to give a damn. I tell him that if the ceiling had hit someone on the head and they had to go to the hospital, the hotel could've been sued. And then he has the audacity to tell me, ""You can try all you want (to sue us)."" (Hmm... I wonder what his supervisor would think about him egging on someone to sue the hotel?)He then asks me if I'm the one staying in the room, which I'm not, and then tells me that he's not talking to me anymore. I tell him that my friend doesn't speak English well, and the guy just ignores me. My friend can't put together the words to continue asking for his money back, so he just says ""ok"" and takes the room keys.We wipe the dirt off his things and pack his stuff. He had to throw away some toiletries. Ultimately, he was able to get money back from his travel insurance company, but the hotel should have been the one to make up for this mess.That manager NEEDS TO BE FIRED! The customer service at the hotel up to that point had been a mixed bag, but the manager did not care about the safety of the hotel's guests, and he certainly did not have a clue about what good customer service is.If you want to put yourself in PHYSICAL HARM and then have to deal with a staff that will TREAT YOU LIKE THE DIRT that litters the lobby floors, I highly recommend this place!",,ethanbakal,9,1.0

I know very well what hospitality and genuine care and concern are supposed to feel like. From the moment I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I knew this would be the first and last time I’d stay here. With the exception of Flora at the Front Desk, everyone I encountered seemed to be irritated or “unbothered.” Sidebar: I think it’s a shame that the Front Office agents/team members don’t receive an incentive for selling upgrades to guests. You want the extra revenue, but you don’t want to reward the team that gets it for you? No bueno!! In any case, even the “manager” that was supposed to return my call seemed more concerned with getting me off the phone than resolving my issues with the overwhelmingly powerful smell of cleaning chemicals in the room. They are so strong that my allergies are going haywire and I am unable to breathe. This manager (with a Spanish accent; he didn’t identify himself on the phone) assured me a Floor Manager was on their way up here to investigate the smell in the room. That was :40 minutes or so ago. I will call down again and ask to be moved. I can’t breathe in this room. Flora was very nice and accommodating. Very friendly and we shared a nice moment. Thanks Flora for caring just a little bit. No one else I encountered did. Kudos to you. After awhile, Fedelia (HSKP Mgr) came up to the room with one of her Room Attendants (possibly the RA that had serviced the room earlier in the day) — I asked them both to come in and tell me if they smelled something. The room attendant said oh yes, it’s probably the detergent in the bathroom —I knew i wasn’t crazy— I asked her if it was strong or just me, she said it was strong and she could smell it. The Floor Manager, Fedelia said, but the room is clean, right?! I agreed that the cleanliness wasn’t the issue just the smell of chemicals. She attempted to call Steve, I think. And there was no answer. So they both left to go to the Front Office.That gesture made me feel a little more welcomed and appreciated. Thanks ladies.

However I will say by no means is this hotel the most lavish and amazing. It was exactly what I expected for the price I paid and if you think $130 is alot for New York or let's be honest any popular area you probably shouldn't be staying in hotels to begin with..... The rooms are not mosaics of art and the building itself is old and needs to be remodeled but again I knew this going in so I didn't expect anything more or less, so when I got in my room I was pleasantly surprised that all the negative reviews I heard were just simply over exaggerations or not true at all. This hotel is in a prime location across from the Madison square garden,Penn Station, a couple blocks from Port Authority and Time Square if that's your thing, steps away from 1 2 3 N Q R and W train which can take you pretty much anyway within 30 min on the subway and one transfer, and of course the mid town Night life is all around you. The service was quick and painless the express check in was broke and I had to wait in line but I'm not a unrealistic person and know things malfunction or just don't work sometimes so I wasn't mad at all the receptionist was friendly and explain everything I needed to know and again since I don't expect these hardworking people to bend to my will it was a very fast and pleasant expierence it's crazy when you are a decent human being and don't let little things bother you the quality of life you have.Ps there is a 100$ hold that will be refunded to you as long as you don't destroy the room just know that when you book a stay in almost any New York hotel there is a deposit.",,Nich W,0,4.0

We went on the hotel's website and checked it out. Everything looked amazing, the rooms looked great(recently renovated) and the price was great. However that all changed once we got in. The only great thing about it was the location, walking distance from some of the must do things in NYC. Would I stay here again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to a friend? Not at all. The Lobby just reeks of smoke once you walk in, it is also outdated. Check in was quick, we got complimentary continental breakfast coupons for Cafe R down the street. As mentioned in some of the reviews its a very simple breakfast, but not terrible. We stayed at one of the ""renovated"" rooms, what a joke! The room looked nothing like the picture and the bathroom was horrendous. I had to double check we weren't in one of the old rooms by mistake. During our stay, there was a posted notice saying that they were having to temporarily shut down the steam service in the hotel. Inconvenient but understandable as it was ""beyond their control"". This was done overnight so wasnt a big concern. However the room was freezing! Even after the steam was turned back on. I had to go to the front desk and ask if they were still having issues as my room was not warming up even at the highest settings. They did send someone I was told as we were not in the room and it got a tad (and when I say a tad, I do mean a TAD) bit warmer. The maid service was non-existent. They gave us 1 roll of toilet paper for the entire stay (3 days, 2 people). We left a note for the maid to please provide us with some more and even left her a tip for her troubles. Note and tip were gone, no TP though. The bathroom itself was very outdated and gross looking. Water pressure was good, and the water would get hot enough, maybe even too hot at times. To end on a positive note, as mentioned in the title, the location was great. We were walking distance to alot of places we wanted to see (Time Square, Empire State, etc.) You got Penn station right across the street which was convenient. The king size bed was comfortable.

Instead I managed to make it for the same night I booked in online. Considering I'm in Cincinnati and the hotel is in New York City, it was an obvious mistake, probably related to the pain drugs. I discovered the problem a week later and called the hotel immediately. I was told I needed to talk with the accounting department. I called everyday for a week, and sent emails explaining my situation to the accounting office and executive office. Nobody answers the phone in either office. Nor has anyone responded to me emails. What's worse, the wait time to reach an operator, who needs to transfer your call, is anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. I've had to eat the charge for the room I couldn't possibly occupied.

Good size. King bed was alittle hard. Think I had an updated refurbished room. Heard other rooms are very old/dated. Room alittle cold because windows very drafty. Nice view. Check in was much faster this time than my previous visit. Which was almost an hour wait....this time 10-15 minutes. Stayed here again because it is right across the street from penn station and Madison square garden. Went to a show there. Only big negative that I experienced both trips was the elevator situation . They have 12 but only a few in use and there is a long long wait and they are so crowded that you have to wait a very long time to get an elevator. And they stop at almost every floor even when completely full. It is a big problem at this hotel. 18 stories. Not practical to take the stairs. I was on 12th floor. Waited a long time for an elevator and the ones that stopped on my floor were full.... plan on taking a good 10-15 minutes to get to the lobby.... it is really crazy. The hotel is huge. Not sure the number of rooms but there are a lot of people who stay here all the time..... honestly the only reason I stayed again is the location.... it is right across the street from Madison square garden and I was going there that night. Not sure I would stay again but it is relatively inexpensive (for nyc standards) and if you take the train as I do, you can't beat the location! Neighborhood is ok, not great.

So we had to open the window an inch to let in cold air, to compensate for the heat in the room. 2) The toilet was positioned waaaaaay to close to the toilet roll. I am an average size guy 5'11"" and my right knee were crunched up against the wall, while my left knee was hitting to tub.

I had trouble getting into my room - but I went to the room with an A after the number which was kind of confusing. Security directed me by phone and all was good. Got to my room - modern, yet nothing special. Small. The bathroom was suitable. Nice TV. The woodwork trim was pretty beat up, looked like from years of painting over it. Towels had a slightly strange odor, can't explain - like a chemical. No fridge in room or coffee maker, but there are tons of places nearby and a shop in the lobby. The Elevator had a beer can and was kind of dirty. Overall, good value and location. Don't expect too much, it's not luxurious though back in its heyday this must have been an incredible place.

Thats when he told us that the heating was not being put on for another few weeks and that an electric heater was not possible due to their fire hazards.He kindly reimboursed us and we managed to secure another hotel in NY for a couple of nights but given that the night is over $300 that felt to me, totally unacceptable and really risked ruining our holiday.","Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","Thedreams</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milton Keynes, United Kingdom</strong>",22,1.0

My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania for three nights for a total of ~$860. First off, we chose early check in($50). Upon arriving early in the morning we didn’t expect to get a room, but figured that they would tell us when to come back and our room would be ready. We we checked our luggage ($5 per piece) and went out. We came back about noon and the room was still not ready, and we were told they probably wouldn’t have it ready until check in time (3:00). Our first experience with staff was lovely. Our second experience with staff was less than desirable. The woman was impolite and short with us. We went out again and came back at about 3:00. We then waited in line for about 35 minutes (because they were understaffed and only had two people checking in). The woman AGAIN told us the room wasn’t ready (it was after 3:00, which is check in time. The lady rudely said that check in is not at 3:00, but is between 3:00 and midnight depending if the room is ready. We told her we had already paid and she said we didn’t, but our receipt showed we had paid (during our first time we got to the hotel we paid). She went back and spoke with somebody because we couldn’t figure out was to do since we have been to the check in desk THREE TIMES at this point. She came back, and miraculously our room was ready and her impolite attitude changed. We finally got to our room. We booked one of the newly renovated rooms, however, upon arriving to our room their idea of renovation is similar to saying you remodeled your house, but all you did was put a new bedspread on your bed. The faucets in the tub were old and gross. The floor in the bathroom was stained and yucky. There was one bar to put your wet towels, but it was so low that you couldn’t put anything on it or it would get the toilet paper roll wet and cover it. The beds were comfortable though, so that’s a plus. The hotel is in a great location too. All in all, not a place I’d recommend for the price that was paid.

Upon arrival we noticed many homeless people wandering around the perimeter of the ""establishment"". On entering the building I noticed a opulent and well finished but dated lobby. Queuing for a length of 25 minutes to check in the receptionist appeared uninterested and tired. After some initial difficulty paying via card the clerk commented that 'we wouldn't have to sleep on the streets tonight', however this soon became a desire for us.The security sitting at the elevators appeared bored and dishevelled. We took the elevator to the 4th floor room 486. The corridor reminded us of a scene from a horror movie and my younger sister was visibly worried. The doors were clearly intended to provide an old style theme. When we entered the first room we were greeted with an appalling scene. Beds were unmade, towels covered the floor and we're stained, pubic hair were visible in the bathtub and the toilet had not been cleaned I suspect since it was installed in 1919. Myself,my mother and younger sister trapsed back downstairs via the elevators of which of the 12 were working. When we approached the lady at reception she apologised but did not seem at all surprised by the condition we found our room in. We were then relocated to floor 2 room 245. The room was spacious, HOWEVER. The beds were creaky and hollow, paint was peeling off the walls and attempts to patch us holes in walls were visible because pink filler was used. Dust covered all surfaces in the room and it was clear this room had not been occupied in many years. Again the bathroom contained unidentifiable substances and the towels were stained with what could have been faecal matter. At this point considering that my family and I had been traveling for over 12hrs my mother left me and my sister in the room while she went back downstairs to request a second room change. After some time I received a text from her asking us to come up to the 7th where are new room was. Taking 3 heavy bags we proceeded to the 7th floor and trudged to room 720A. Generally in testing A would mean something good but in terms of scoring I wouldve thrown this rooms grade in the bin. Decor was dated the carpet was dirty. The mirror was unclean. The only good thing about this room was the WiFi signal was great. We had a nice view onto MSG which we THOUGHT was a bonus. The bathroom was clean enough to use however only shampoo was provided and the towels were only a little bigger than hand towels.Come night time we realised that the curtains in our room blocked out little to no light coming from the MSG arena which made it very difficult to sleep. We also order extra pillows to the room which took 45 minutes to arrive by which time we were all asleep. We decided to stay in the hotel as we had no way of getting our money back in time to book another hotel as it was only a 5 day stay. We did not partake in the complimentary breakfast as the cafe which was serving it looked extremely dodgey and unpleasant. Upon returning to the ""hotel"" we were pleasantly surprised that our room had been cleaned considering the two other rooms had not been after guests had left. It was at this time my sister cut her foot getting out of the shower as the tiles in the bathroom were chipped. Over the course of our stay conditions did not improve and we had no safe deposit box and so resorted to hiding money and passports under our beds which we were fully sure would not be cleaned. When the time came to check out the receptionist was again uninterested and ignorant. We checked our bags into the storage room as we would not be flying out till later that night. This was when we came across the only nice member of staff the entire visit, the baggage holder was polite and neatly dressed. When collecting our bags the bell captain was visibly annoyed and stressed as he was dealing with a rather ignorant and annoying customer who was being rude because he was trying to do his job properly and unaided by another member of staff but was polite to us. Some points to note:1)The hallway on floor 7 smelt like piss2)It takes ages to get a lift the the lobby in the mornings as everyone is only able to access 6 of the 12 lifts.3)STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE4)SERIOUSLY DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR SPEND A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!All in all 2/10 excellent stay.

MSG over the road and a short walk to Times Square, with plenty of great places to eat and drink. The walk to Central Park was more than manageable, with some super sights along the way. On arriving at the Hotel there was an enormous line to check in. My new Wife and I took advantage of the 'Express Check-In', which was express, and done in just a minute or so. This was probably the highlight of the Hotel. We got to our room on the third floor. The door had the 1919 Valet door on the front, we didn't expect to actually step back in time. The brown decor (or dirt) greeted us first, the stained mattress was surprising and the 70's bathroom just topped it off. We ended up attending 'Target' to buy our own downer to sleep under as the blanket that was provided seemed.........awful (I'm being nice there).The Hotel does have free wi-fi, although if you want to use it, you will have to endure the hour long wait to check-in as the access code is held there. Also if you don't look at the screens behind the check-in desk you won't know to purchase luggage tokens to save time when you check-out. Also don't bother asking the bell captain, very rude and uninformative. On top of this when my wife and I left our room one day we were greeted by housekeeping who asked' Would you like service today?????', I nearly responded with 'Of course we do, but you'll need a blow torch and start again'.

We arrived on a Thursday evening late and were so disappointed at the quality of this hotel, at $900 for three nights, we almost left the next day. If not for the hassle that would’ve chewed up time here, we would have. We were in one of the “renovated” rooms. Room #1011A. The bathroom is about the size of a closet. You have to shut the door before you can sit on the pot. The pedestal sink has only a very narrow shelf above it for setting anything down. There are no hooks, even on the back of the bathroom door. One small towel rod with clumsy access to it behind the door by the toilet. They are proud of their original cast iron tubs but they are so small, slippery and if a big person was showering, cramped. Being proud of the cast iron tubs seems an excuse not to spend money to upgrade the bathroom. No washcloths and the bath linens so rough and small I wonder if they’ve been around for 100 years. The complimentary soap was only facial soap for body soap. Had a weird grittiness that made the tub even more slippery. No exhaust fan in the bathroom but maybe because it’s such a old hotel, still. The room itself is quite large. Large enough that there could have been two queen beds in here instead of two full. Again ridiculous for the price. And ""that's a New York hotel for you"" is a sorry excuse. Why not rise above the norm? Set a new New York standard? No artwork on the walls. A decorative and floor length mirror were the only things on the walls besides the TV. There was only a desk and then 15 feet of wall space that could have had a dresser of some sort, so that the desktop area didn’t have to be shared by 3 people. The beds were comfortable except for the sheets. Scratchy old sheets that were made on bed as a flat sheet on mattress and then another flat sheet with thin velour blanket on top and then another flat sheet on top of blanket as a coverlet. No comforter or bedspread. Heat wouldn’t turn off. Opened the window to cool off room then couldn’t get window closed. The carpet is new and clean. The hallways in the hotel are dim and dinghy. Not welcoming as you walk to your room for the first time. We all agreed we expected to see twins on big wheels come around the corner! The large community area in front of the elevators on each floor were either empty or weakly decorated with outdoor wicker furniture. No artwork or decorations in the common area or hallways. Just not welcoming. Nothing cheerful. Felt like a tired old hotel. I understand it must be a monumental undertaking to renovate a property this size. It just seems that a lot of the basics, we all have in our own homes, have been forgotten. Do not believe that the pictures of the rooms and bathroom listed from the hotel are what you are gonna to get. While we realize that a hotel in NYC is more expensive than other areas of the country, we do not think it is too much to expect to have an experience at least comparable to a Holiday Inn Express.

Right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Take the train anywhere or walk as most attractions are walking distance.- Beds were very comfortable and plenty of pillows were provided. Our double room had 4 pillows per bed.Cons:- In my opinion charging guests $5 per bag prior to check in is a bit of a cash grab. I would have been okay with a charge to leave my bags after I had checked out, but when I am checking in....just wrong.- Service requests were not met in a timely manner or at all. I had to call the operator 3 times to finally get a Do Not Disturb sign for my room. During our stay the hotel switched from A/C to Heat and when I called to enquire how to cool the room I was told someone would come up and open the window. I gave up after the 3rd attempt to have someone open the window. No one ever showed up.- Security: there is a sign at the elevator that states guest must show room card prior to access the elevators. I showed my card each time but most guests didn't and I never saw anyone challenged when they made their way to the elevators.- Renovated room??? That is questionable. If the room I had was renovated then it was not done by a professional. The door jam looked like it had been repaired and not well as it was very obvious. The caulking around the tub was definitely not done by a professional. I was worried the entire time we were at the hotel that the shelf in the bathroom would fall down if we put anything on it as it was already leaning away from the wall. There was a stain on the curtains and the walls may have been repainted recently but the walls were not repaired prior to the painting. All in all it looked like a DIY job. Not what I would expect at a hotel where it cost me almost $2,000 for a 7 night stay.- The door latch would only disengage when the room key was inserted in the closed door or when you turned the knob from the inside. To close the door on your way out you had to slam the door for it to close as the latch was in the locked position and the outside door knob didn't turn the latch. This resulted in a lot of noise whenever anyone would leave their room and close the door. Not a problem during the day but late at night/early in the morning it was quite noisy. I am sure we didn't make any friends when we left at 4:30 am and had to slam the door to ensure that it was closed properly.Overall it was decent and I would probably recommend this hotel to friends.","Abbotsford, Canada","keyboarder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abbotsford, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

I'm lucky enough to pass through on a fairly regular basis, so when I found the Pennsylvania, I as really pleased as the price was good for slap bang in the middle of town when normally, most hotels just want to take your bank account and empty it - so that was a welcome find.Check in was an easy affair as I used the automated check in facility as the check in line was huge so that saved a load of time. However, leaving the lift, the age of the hotel arrived. I was on the 4th floor, and the carpets looked very worn, the walls were bashed and marked and the what would have been lovely eloborate doors to rooms were also looking tired. Room was a great size compared to what I stayed in last time in another hotel. Perfectly comfortable size, slept like a log in the bed, but the bathroom was very tired, damaged bath with a leaking tap that dripped constantly. I imagin in it's prime, it looked amazing!At the end of the day, it is somewhere to sleep as I wasn't in there long as out running aroud the city enjoying that - but it's just such a shame that hotels charge you a fortune and then don't plough it back in the rooms and decor quick enough. I know there is some refurbishment taking place, but for a hotel that comes accross as an established hotel, it would be really nice to see some investment back into it. Also, bit disappointed that the hotel charges $5 per bag that is help in the luggage room. First time I've ever come across this and it was another $10 I wasn't expecting to have to spend which was a shame as most hotels I've stayed in graciously looked after bags for nothing. Didn't bother with breakfast as wanted to get out and support a local Deli and kiosks which I enjoy doing.But if you treat it as somewhere to sleep only and not use it as a ""normal"" hotel, it's a great location to stay, right opposite MSG and Penn station which makes getting to the airports easier than hauling your bags everywhere or jumping in cabs all the time.",,Nic_F1642,0,3.0

Yes, this is a decently (for NYC) priced hotel in Midtown, very good location and less expensive than other options. Just one night, I figured it would be fine. It wasn’t. I wound up paying more in fees and other costs due to their inefficiencies, and also felt unsafe there. I would strongly encourage others to stay elsewhere. We arrived after a long flight at 1am, there was a line to check-in, and we were told they had no rooms available that were the type we booked (one King, one with three Twins). There was another guest yelling at the front desk about the fact that there was no bottles of water in her room. Upon taking the elevator up to the room, we found a drunk man sleeping on the sofa on the 12th floor. The room was old and dilapidated. They had told us they would bring another bed to a room with two beds, but by 1:45am we were tired of waiting and canceled it. On the way down the following morning, the doors opened and there was a group of two people sleeping on sofas in the elevator area of that floor. We wanted to leave our bags at the bag check for the day and had to, again, wait in line to the front desk to do this (you cannot go directly to a bellman or the bag check room). We were charged $5/bag. They sent us downstairs to drop them off, where we waited again in a long line to drop the bag off. As a result we now were late for our activity and had to take a Lyft to get there rather than the bus, adding another ~$50 to our cost.","Seattle, Washington","BlueScotch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",29,1.0

As we only wanted to drop off our baggage and check in after 3pm, we were able to obtain a luggage ticket and leave our luggage in storage for a cost of $5.On returning to the hotel about 5pm, we joined a queue of 3 couples waiting to check in. After about 40 minutes we were finally seen by a receptionist who checked us in and gave us key cards to our room.We then went to collect our luggage from the storage facility. We were greeted by a parcel delivery man with a cage full of parcels checking in parcels with the luggage storage worker, who acknowledged our presence but continued checking parcels and leaving us to wait for our luggage.This I thought was rather rude as we were the only customers waiting for luggage and after all we were customers of the hotel.On entering our room which was dated & required some TLC at the very least, we thought well it is only for 1 night. We had a quick look around in the bathroom which was disgusting,enamel coating coming off the bath, cracks in the paintwork and only one hand towel.We decided to ring housekeeping to obtain some more towels, unfortunately the telephone didn't work,so we tried to switch the main lamp on to see if the telephone was plugged in, the lamp also didn't work. To our dismay the wires were all exposed coming out of the wall from both of the appliances.On returning to reception and stating that this was unacceptable, we were given one of the renovated rooms. On entering the renovated room, which was an improvement to the previous room but still required more work to renovate it, one of the doors to a connecting room had not been repainted and had a plastic raw plug stuffed in the keyhole, the mirrors had not been cleaned and the lampshades had pink stains on them.We decided to go out for the evening. On returning to our hotel room we were unable to enter our room and had to go back to reception to find out why. Yes we had to queue again but in the complaints queue! The receptionist informed us that we had checked out, we informed the receptionist that we had only checked in a few hours ago. New key cards acquired.I have can honestly say that this has been the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, the staff not welcoming or friendly and the state of the rooms dire.

Then we went inside..........There was a queue for reception to check in. Only 2 members of staff were there even though there were multiple reception staff floating around. It took over an hour to check in and there were inly around 10 people in front of us. The staff had no urgency, were miserable and did not give the customer service you expect from America. The woman we had was sarcastic in a rude way not funny one. We were then charged an extra $160 for the stay which is apparently normal as it’s for tax and hotel facilities (Ha the facilities were terrible) We went up to our room which was excessively large. There was a bed, tv, desk and side tables with lamps. The beds cover was damp and smelt strongly of bleach. There was air conditioning but it was unusable due to the noise it gave out. The windows were single glazed so the noise from outside was like the windows were open. The bathroom was very dated and the baths paint was peeling. Then there were two doors that went into next doors rooms. We could open them so wedged things up against them to stop people getting in. The towels were just a little larger than hand towels. I asked for larger ones and was told they would supply but this never happened. The saving grace was that the location of the hotel was amazing and obviously it was a “cheap stay” for New York.

On September 30th at about 4 am, I received a text alert from my credit card company letting me know that the Hotel Pennsylvania had attempted to charge my card for the full amount, but the credit card company would deny the charge if I did not confirm it (understandably, as it was days before my booking, for a large amount, 1000 miles away from where I'm located, in the middle of the night). I did not receive the alert until 7 am, because, again, middle of the night, so the card was declined. In the morning, I called to ask about the charge and confirm my reservation, and was told my reservation was in place, and when I pressed about the charge, they didn't seem to know what I was talking about. Because the reservation was confirmed and I had no weird charge on my card, I let it go.When we arrived on the 3rd, I was informed my reservation had been cancelled because my card had been declined. Sheila at the front desk repeatedly told me ""no one can help you"" in response to my asking about why my card had been charged. Eventually, another employee directed us to the manager (Jean), who again looked up my reservation, repeated the same information about the credit card without any answers to why it had been run or why i hadn't been informed of the cancellation when I called. He did not offer any other options until we asked about another room, and said a downgraded room at a higher price would be available, but we would have to call the booking site we originally booked on to book it.Customer service at the booking site found us a similar room to what we'd originally booked for a similar price, but when she called the hotel to confirm, she was transferred a few times and eventually hung up on. While this was happening, we were thankfully able to find a room at the hilton garden inn a few blocks away for about $500 less total than our original price. I understand that hotels often test charge cards, but the entire situation with the timing and the cancellation felt odd, and I do not understand why I wasn't informed of this when I called. If I'd had no text alerts on my phone, I'd have had zero indication my card was declined. The lack of notification and the complete unwillingness to help was incredibly frustrating. I understand mistakes happen, and I understand that sometimes hotels are completely booked, and that there's not always a way to help! But nobody wanted to look into this. We were repeatedly cut off as employees left us to speak to other customers while we were at the front of the line. I still have no clue why my card was run at that time; is this standard practice?It was an incredibly frustrating experience that ultimately worked out as we found another hotel, but it's definitely not great to find out your reservation has been cancelled automatically. If this is standard practice for this hotel, I feel like something in the process needs to be looked at to avoid stranded customers.",,Christina E,2,1.0

I understand that it’s a very old hotel with 1700 rooms but it is a poorly unkept dump! The tub in her room would not drain so she was standing in water for 2 days. We reported it multiple times, it never got fixed. My tub stopper was filled and covered with black mold. We asked to change rooms. Her new room had mold on the bottom of the window curtains. The tub lining in my new room was peeling away in a huge section . All rooms had major chipped paint, scuffed walls, stained carpeting. Rooms are inconsistent. One room has a stained chair to sit in, the other does not have a chair even though same sized room. The hallway carpeting had rips that were held together with duct tape. We asked for blankets multiple times and they finally came they were deteriorated with holes. I was concerned when I saw the guest rating for this hotel before my trip and now I understand why it is so low. I am still in shock over this hotel. I’ve stayed in many hotels in New York and never had an experience like this in any of them!The hotel's response is that they are renovating. Well then don't charge such a high price for moldy, deteriorated rooms and bathrooms until you have fully renovated!The Hotel Pennsylvania is a disaster.",,Dk B,0,2.0

Very fresh and nicely decorated, very comfortable bed and very quiet.The only problem is that the old furniture has been removed now there is only a desk and absolutely no place to put anything. Hint to hotel- my room, 1192, was quite small, but there is room in the closet for some shelves. Having stayed recently at several other others in the area, I have found that long check in lines seem to be a general problem, but even with the kiosks the lines at the Penn do seem to be endless. The breakfast at the restaurant across the road includes a good-sized fruit cup and a nice selection of breads, although you could only choose one item. Very few NYC hotels include breakfast at all. BTW, the R restaurant where the breakfast is served has an excellent buffet and jazz at lunch on Thursdays. I love the old-fashioned news stand in the lobby and there is also a little cafe. Of course, the big draw of the Penn is its location, across the road from Penn station, the 1,2,3 subways lines literally under the hotel, and many other lines one block away, both east and west, and the Broadway theaters are about a twenty-minute walk away. I often walk back alone after a show and feel perfectly safe. So I think the Penn- as long as you have a renovated room is great value.

Wires were coming out of the wall, no plug visible for the TV, I think! The bathroom was circa 1920 with the original bath with a hole in the side of it! The shower head was supported by a plastic drinking cup, presumably to aim the water at you, we didn't try it! There was a hole in the wooden window frame, the door had so much paint on it it did not close! the same went for the cupboard in the room. There was a mechanical noise right outside the window, we tried to sleep but after an hour gave up. I went to reception and asked for another room, after 15 minutes the receptionist agreed and we we given room 705. This was a slightly better and bigger room, king bed and again the bathroom was slightly better, shower OK, glass top no sharp edges, doors not closing again, windows so dirty you could just make out the buildings outside! Ceiling tiles circa 1970's all stained and damaged in both rooms, possibly Asbestos! No noise in this room. All in all the worst hotel experience we have ever had, very expensive, rude staff at reception, breakfast not in the hotel but in a large diner about 500 metres away.

Locks on the door made it feel as if I was in a slum. Bedding was worn out several years past and the TV was old with an antenna that might get 4 channels on a good day. The room was dimly lit as well. To bring this to the front desk's attention the solution was to spend about $100 more / night to ""upgrade"". This room had internet - the other did not - and was a very basic standard room at any other hotel chain in the USA or abroad.

We had 6 cases between us and we were completely exhausted after all the traveling. When we arrived the hotel was very busy and difficult to navigate round. We checked in a room on the 4th floor. I can not describe how awful the room was. There was a hole in the wall where the electrical wires were closed with cello tape, it was so dated, there was a picture hanging off the wall, I just felt like we were staying in a prison! Having just short of $900 dollars for 4 nights we expected a little more! The room we were sold was completely through false advertisement! The pictures showed clean updated rooms and the room we were checked into was nothing like it! If we had known what the room conditions were like we could NOT have stayed! However despite being disappointed we rang reception where a lovely reception manager named Jean helped us. We explained our situation and how unhappy we were. He made the journey to our room to check it over, he then showed us other available rooms that were more like the pictures on booking.com! He upgraded us and we want to thank him for that because if we had stayed on floor 4 it would have ruined our time here!

It was our first time in New York. Upon arrival, we were first of all met with a 45 min queue just to leave our bags at the hotel, so we could go see the city. When we finally got through the queue, we were told that the baggage storage was 5 dollars per item.... We of course wanted to pay, but the employee told us that they did not accept card at the moment. We asked if we could just pay later, but that was refused, and we had to carry our bags in New York the whole day until check-in, which was kind of annoying. When we got back to check in, the employee asked us to pay 333 dollars. We were confused since we already paid online for the full stay. When i said that, the employee asked for ""evidence"" of the amount paid. I offered to show him the receipt on my e-mail but that was only possible if i got the wifi password (i am not from the US, so i had no data). I was told that he could not give the password before check in. This then forced me to pay the full amount of the stay AGAIN, only to get the wifi password and come back to show that everything was paid in advance, which it of course were. My money was then refunded. The employee who then handled the refund was the only friendly person on the hotel.We then got to the room, which was what we had expected, it was not cleaned properly. There were hair in the drain, hair underneath the sink and hair all over the bathroom floor. At that moment we did not want to deal with anymore of the staff, so we just cleaned it ourselves. The next day we were looking forward to the breakfast that was included in the price. We were looking for the hotel buffet, but there were not any. We then found out that the breakfast was a coupon for a little café on the same street as the hotel, but it was the worst hotel breakfast i have ever seen. The coupon was for a chewy bagel, a juice/coffee, and a little bowl of fruit that just tasted like it was 5 days old. To get the buffet, which looked bad as well, you had to pay additional 10 dollars. All in all, the breakfast was in my opinion completely disgraceful compared to the price for staying at the hotel. As our last point of discontent: When we got home from a long day in New York at 5pm to rest a bit before we went for dinner, the room had not been cleaned. The room service arrived a bit after 5pm, but at that moment we were using the room to get ready for dinner. We therefore had to refuse cleaning of our room. I would always expect cleaning to happen way before this hour. All in all, i would never ever recommend this hotel. I feel that it was a rip off and just a pretty facade to cover up all other things about this hotel. I am very sad that i decided to spent my money here. Normally, we would apply for a refund or tell the staff at the hotel how i felt, but since the staff had been so unfriendly and since there was a queue that looked about 30 minutes long, we just didn't want to waste anymore time at this hotel.

Of course, most hotels were fully booked and over-booked, but this was the only hotel with plenty of rooms.It was the most disgusting place I have stayed at, including youth hostels in Asia and Russia. The room was filthy with uncollected linens, there was ""poop"" in the toilet, unflushed, holes in the walls which allowed in HUGE cockroaches, and the dirtiest, most uncomfortable bed I have encountered in a hotel. Fortunately, I had a heavy fur coat which I used on the mattress (which I checked because I was sure to find bedbugs, but none, thankfully), and I left for the hospital at 6 am because I couldn't stand the odor and filth any longer.I looked up this hotel on Google and it appears it is about to be torn down with a new office tower in its place. Perhaps this is why no one cares what's going on.And finally, all the above atrocities that I complained about were completely ignored. In fact, when I went to the front desk and told her about the poop in the toilet, her response was ""why don't you flush it.:""That should tell you everything.

On the website it looks great. In reality I had the worst experience! First room I was given was full of dust. The barely running AC unit was filled with elbow of dust, dirt and who knows what. It was unbearable to stay there for more than hour before getting a coughing fit. Corners , carpet , furniture - all dust. Bathroom was not much better- the bathtub was filthy. They could not give me a different room that night so I stayed in the lobby for majority of the night. They finally gave me a different room one floor up. After a pretty unpleasant conversation with the manager on duty. Room was a bit cleaner and bathroom was alright to use. I was out most of the day on meetings. Once I came back I was greeted by a fat mouse in the room ! This is unacceptable! I had another room change, but my host hearing about terrible musty and nasty conditions was already looking for a different hotel for me, thank god because the last room I was given ( literally just walked in and out) had not been aired in years- the moldy smell was terrible! That was in July. A month ago. I still didn’t get my security deposit back even tho I was told it takes 10 days. Which is also ridiculous. Every hotel I ever stayed at refund the deposit the next day at the latest. I did not get to sleep in this hotel. I had nothing but trauma. And now my emails and phone calls about my deposit back are being ignored. Do yourself favor and stay away from this horror hotel. Staff is nice only on the check in. Any issue is greeted with nasty attitude, lack of politeness and plain rudeness. Where do I call to get my deposit back ?

This is the worst hotel i’ve stayed at in my entire life!!!!!!! Don’t get deceived by the lobby. Once the elevator takes you to your floor, everything looks different. We checked in at around 6 pm at this hotel and it was fast. We booked two rooms which are both located at the 8th floor. The hallway has a bates motel feels. It feels like you’re in a haunted house. The first room that we booked was freakin smelly! While the second room was still occupied by other guests (if you ever decided to stay at this hotel make sure to not leave important belongings!) we reported this incident at the front desk and he immediately replaced our key card and doesn’t feel sorry at all for giving us a room that is still occupied as if it was something normal. We also asked the F.O on duty to replace the first room since it was smelly.Since we don’t have a choice anymore, we just forced ourselves to just sleep in the room since we have a tour to Canada the following morning. Mind you, all of us couldn’t wait to check out asap.Their Front Office representatives also sucks!!!!!!!!!!! For no apparent reason, our key card suddenly stopped working and so we reported it again to the F.O in charge and that old lady was so rude that she can’t even show a little sympathy. Mind you it was already 1 AM and she said she couldn’t do anything with our concern and directed us to the manager. She doesn’t definitely fit in the hospitality industry. We were supposed to stay here after our trip to Canada but we decided to cancel it. I mean if you have extra cash, i bet there’s more hotel that offers greater service in the same location.

This time I noticed some attempts towards improvement - some antique furniture pieces (like the desk, chair and bedside table in my room) had had their internal parts renovated. All in all, I considered it quite nice. The big HOWEVER regarding my stay, though, comes from two points, both related to the front desk.The first one is a serious problem with the attitude of the people who work there. The hotel is huge, there are people checking in and out all the time, so lines at the counter are frequent, but this does not justify the sour faces and almost rude tone of the staff there (with one or two exceptions). When you are traveling, you expect your trip to be pleasant and to take good memories home, so being treated as if you are troubling the people who are there to help you definitely puts a damper on it all. I would say a little smile and a less blunt approach would do wonders to cause a better impression.The second - and more serious problem - is the processing of payment. I had a reservation for 7 days and when I went to pay for it, for some unexplainable reason none of my credit cards (yes, I tried more than one) worked - even though on the same day they did work at other places. The clerk tried to charge the cards via computer, but it did not work either, and when I called the credit card companies (yes, I made INTERNATIONAL calls trying to solve that), they assured me the cards were all working perfectly. In the end, I had to pay in cash and, given the length of my stay, the amount I had to disburse was not little. Fortunately I had it on me, otherwise I would have been helpless and without a roof over my head in NYC. When I kindly complained about it at the moment of my check out, I was told by one of the clerks that ""it happened all the time with Brazilian and Argentinian people's cards"", so if it is such a common occurrence, it is beyond my comprehension WHY they have not solved the problem yet.",,RenataP1022,2,4.0

WTF?!?! Long story short they “lost” my reservation and said we don’t have your room. The had spelled my name wrong, then they had surprise hidden fees for storing bags ($5 dollars per bag) which is fine, I’ve paid bag fees before but they did not once tell me that this would happen. So we pay the fee take our bags downstairs and leave them there. My guest and I go out and about in NYC and enjoyed what we could while waiting to get into our room. We come back 3 hours after check in and they said your reservation is invalid and we don’t have the room. They begrudgingly gave us a room after 30 minutes of them searching for one. We get to the room and it’s completely outdated straight out of the 60-70s. Stains on the carpet, broken bed frames, no towels or rags. The shower curtains and walls had blood stains on it. There was no water to take a shower with either.We went down to the lobby to speak with the manager and they said “well were to busy to even think of upgrading so we’ll refund you and you can leave!” SERIOUSLY?

I was a little shocked at the room as I had booked and paid for a refurbished room and found myself in a slightly tired and scruffy room - which would have been fine, it just wasn’t what I paid for. I had to make a dinner reservation so I decided I would fix it when I got back so as not to inconvenience my family members. Furthermore, this was my first night and my first time in New York and I was excited to see it. When I came back to then hotel it was after midnight and I was told that nothing could be done until morning.Morning came and I spoke to a friendly staff member at the desk who told me my room was all set to be swapped but that I couldn’t do it this morning and I would have to do it when I got back. 37000 steps later I returned to the hotel weary and the last thing on my mind was changing my room. I dragged my battered feet to the desk and was lucky enough to be served by Maria B. She quickly changed the room keys and apologised for the mix up. Added to my room woes, I had been charged twice for my room (to the tune of a further $600). Maria B was on it in a heartbeat, reversing the transaction and printing me proof of the reversal. More importantly she did it all with good grace, and speed and efficiency - no task was too difficult and I think if she had been capable of giving me new feet after my 20 miles in Manhattan, she would have. Brilliant location right in the centre of midtown, perfectly pleasant hotel. But I would opt for a newly refurbished room if you can.",,Swollenfootblues,0,4.0

If I hadn't been so tired and angry, I probably could have at least gotten a laugh at how inept they were. Any how - the pictures you see on the hotel page for travel sites are not in any way indicative of the actual state of this hotel.This hotel has an amazing history and in its heyday in the 30s and 40s was undoubtably the place to be seen in NYC. Today, it is a huge disappointing mess that that I left tired and needing a shower.","Olathe, Kansas","BostonJayhawk81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Olathe, Kansas</strong>",2,1.0

Had a horrific experience with Booking.com who cancelled our reservation the night before we were due to arrive at this hotel. I called the Hotel directly from Ireland and managed to get another reservation at a cheaper price - the hotel were extremely helpful. This hotel is a must for any one visiting New York for the first time. Situated right next to Penn Station and directly opposite from Madison Square Gardens, this was the easiest hotel to find. The check-in desks are exceptionally busy so you might have a wee while to wait before you get to your room, however they normally have 5/6 staff at any given time - this just goes to show how busy and popular this hotel is. We had originally booked for a deluxe room but because of the cancelled booking, we just went for the basic double room. Our room was massive, which was adequate for the 4 of us....2 enormous double beds, large walk in closet/dressing room and loads of walking space in the bedroom. Rooms were lovely and clean and beds made and bins emptied daily. We received breakfast vouchers for the cafe just out the side door of the hotel for breakfast. We received lovely pastries, fresh fruit pots, OJ and coffee - this was perfect for all of us.

I wanted to take the time to let everyone know that I had a GREAT EXPERIENCE. The hotel was built in the early 1900s and I loved the history of it. My room was GREAT...I stayed in the Penn5000 section of the 12th floor and I had absolutely NO PROBLEMS. The beds were not uncomfortable and I have back problems so if that tells you anything. They are not my mattresses from home so again, I kept that in mind. The hotel is being renovated so I kept that in mind. I have read here that the hotel doors were coffin doors........and they are not. Valet doors were used to hang your clothes in so they could be laundered. The guest would put the clothes in on his side of the door and at night, the laundry would come by and retrieve them opening his side of the valet door. In the morning, the guests clothes were hanging in the valet door freshly laundered for the guest.....HOW AWESOME !!!!! I wish that was still active. I was awakened by what sounded like someone working on the pipes from another floor but it was later in the morning after 9 am. The staff was great (especially Charles the Bellhop, I hope I got his name right) he shared a little history of the hotel and was of great help. I had absolutely NO PROBLEMS with this hotel !!

I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels, hostels, camps, Airbnb’s, and other types of lodging establishments during these trips. I can say with complete certainty that the Hotel Pennsylvania was far and away the absolute worst among these experiences.Our stay began with the doormen being too busy chit chatting among themselves to help with our bags or hold the doors open for us after having walked several blocks in the July heat. At check in, they informed us of the mandatory $40/night facilities fee. I asked what the fee was for, and the agent behind the desk simply said “facilities”. After about 3 minutes of back-and-forth, she informed us that the fee included a continental breakfast at Cafe R across the street, access to the New York Sports Club fitness center, and free local & international calls from the room phone. The room looked as though it has not been renovated since 1975, with the exception of a television from 2009. The carpet and bedsheets were so dusty that I spent most of the time in the room sneezing and blowing my nose into the coarse toilet paper available to us. The shower was almost unusable as the hot water pipe leaked out of the faucet knob, making it scalding hot and nearly impossible to turn off. The AC in the room, a beat-up window unit, did little to curb the extreme summer heat.After our first night, we woke up and made our way to the breakfast at Cafe R. Words cannot begin to describe how horrendous this experience was. Upon entering the cafe, which was actually a convenience store with a buffet line in the middle, we were informed that the $40 continental breakfast was actually one pastry, one juice OR coffee, and a cup of warm fruit per person. After breakfast, I attempted to make use of the sports facilities also included in the $40 fee, but was turned away as my shoes were not “appropriate” for the gym. I have attached a photo of the tennis sneakers I was wearing. I attempted to call the hotel guest services line to voice my complaints, but nobody answered. Fast forward to the next day; I once again try to call the guest services line in order to request a late check out, and am again greeted with nothing more than a never ending ring. I hang up and dial the operator and ask that she connect me to the lobby so I may ask for a late check out. The operator has apparently no concept of the correlation between the front desk and the lobby, and rudely informs me that “there is no phone in the lobby” before hanging up. I call back and firmly ask her to connect me to the front desk, to which her reply is “there aren’t phones at the front desk either *sigh* what do you need?”. I have never been treated so rudely by hotel staff in my life. It is safe to say that the Hotel Pennsylvania is amazing in all the worst ways. It amazes me that they have no regard for maintaining room quality to provide guests with a comfortable stay. It amazes me that their staff are consistently rude and impolite. It amazes me that they can get away with charging guests $40 for a $2 value breakfast. It amazes me that they are in business at all! If you are heading to NYC, for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel like the bubonic plague (it’s likely you’ll catch something at least that bad just sleeping in their beds). There are plenty of much better hotels in Midtown Manhattan, at same or lower cost. The only benefit of staying at Hotel Penn is that you will feel so unpleasant there that you’ll be encouraged to get out and do more in the city!",,AerospaceTravel,2,1.0

We were on the 7th floor and had two fully laden touring bikes weighing nearly 100 lbs each We waited for an empty lift for 30 minutes in vain. Every elevator was full going in both directions It was the day of the Gay Pride March and a lot of people were coming and going, probably more than they have handled beforeThis however is no excuse for the total lack of planning, for the indifference  of the staff and managementWe phoned the front desk to tell them of our dilemma and to ask if they had a service elevator. Their response was that we had to wait for an elevator and that there was no service elevators. This was a lieWe waited another 15 minutes with no let up of people going both ways, so we decided to walk our fully laden bikes down 7 flights. This was a slow an exhausting 30 minutes There were dozens of people using the stairs, some carrying heavy cases. These stairs should be used as an emergency exit, not as a way of getting to and from the rooms. We got to level 2 I think where we saw the service elevators. There are probably six of them, all of them capable of reaching the top floor. We used them for last couple of floors I fail to see why these elevators weren’t brought into setvice to alleviate the load on the guest elevatorsThe person we spoke to at the front desk was indifferent to our plight and lied to us about the availability of service elevators. I was astonished to later see the manager safely ensconced in his office when he should have been outside overseeing the disaster that was unfoldingThe hotel staff are appalling, indifferent and rude.

I wanted to see the Lion King on broadway, so I booked a two night stay. The check in process requires a bit of patience. The staff at check in have the responsibility of multitasking with a smile. Some did it very well, others not so much. So again, patience is required. Housekeeper knocked on my door at 9am when check out is at 11am that was very frustrating. Not just my door, she proceeded to bang on every door in the hallway with a sharp object, and used her master key to push open the doors. Yelling, housekeeping! I would hate to think management approved that method, even though she told me they do.I also got NO visits from a housekeeper to replace towels, or remove trash. My room was never serviced during my stay. Maybe that’s another order from management ?  My room was on the 9th floor, a newly remodeled room, but you have to request that. Otherwise, it’s an older hotel and you have to expect less than updated features. The breakfast coupon I never used, so I can’t comment on the food. The drink coupon is for $10 there are no good drinks in NYC for $10 keep that in mind. Location, their biggest selling point. Across the street from Madison square arena, few blocks from Times Square and 1,2,3 penn station trains.

If there is no line just by pass the kiosk and visit the front counter, Maria B was very helpful when we checked in. The rooms are dated but the beds were comfortable. Ok so if you like a really nice bar that crafts great drinks, yes crafts drinks, American Whisky is just a couple of blocks away, Secret if you like oysters, they are a dollar during the happy hour weekdays, not advertised. They have a nice jalapeno vinigerette with pop rocks don't knock it until you try it. Korean food is just a few blocks the other way, try Barn Joo 35. Right across the street is Macy's, that is a pick up spot for the on-off buses. A block away is the subway very cool we took the D train up to Yankee Stadium to watch the game.

The room was accommodating with plenty of space and it was clean. There was a sitting area and a small kitchen area with full-sized fridge, and just one bathroom for everyone. It was off positioned off one of the bedrooms. This wasn’t necessarily a problem, but you had to disturb those in the king bedroom to go use the bathroom. Beds were standard. Sheets were on the thin side but the pillows were nice and fluffy. One of the lights in the closet didn’t work but we didn’t need it; however there was no cold water from the bathroom sink. Only hot. We also wished the garage cans were a bit bigger; those small ones filled fast, and in the am, we would have loved a coffeemaker. No microwave either. While the building is old, there was plenty of working elevators and a nice coffee shop in the lobby with yummy pastries and snacks/drinks. We checked out quickly at the kiosks but still had a $6 charge remaining; we didn’t understand what it was for, but looking at the long line waiting to get to the front desk, we just paid it and went on our way.

But the convenience was offset but mainly negative experiences the rest of our stay.While the rooms are being renovated, and we had an attractive room, the hallways and lower floors (luggage storage) are REALLY shabby, smelly, and stained. The overall feel was that the hotel needs a deep cleaning and lots of touch ups. Hopefully these areas will be renovated soon, too. The new mattresses are great and we slept well. Our room did not have black out curtains or curtain liners, just sheer curtains, and was VERY bright and noisy with outside lights and traffic, so I recommend bringing a sleep mask and ear plugs. Our room also did not match the online photos of the renovated rooms, and we specifically paid under a promotion for a renovated room. Very disappointed.I was surprised that we had to pay to store our suitcase when we arrived a few hours before check-in. I understand paying to hold it after check-out, but I felt nickled and dimed. You have to get in line at check in to purchase luggage tickets and then take the elevator to the lower level for storage. Keep in mind that breakfast is different than they advertise. Whether you take the included continental breakfast or pay the upcharge for a hot buffet, BREAKFAST IS NOT ON SITE. You have to go a little less than a block away to a restaurant. This should be made explicitly clear for disabled guests; as it is currently advertised, it is misleading. The food was truly awful, even for a basic diner, and there was no seating on the first or second floor, and no air conditioning on a 90 degree day. We ate standing up, picked at our food, and left drenched in sweat.The worst part of all was the customer service. We were first checked into a room that still had guests staying in it! We keyed in and they were still using the room, alarming us and them. The hotel staff gave us a different room, but the employee truly didn't seem to care that we were upset about hotel safety. The next day, we cheerfully asked a different employee for directions (couldn't see the exit door to use for breakfast) and he was SO RUDE! He would not give us directions, but said, ""see my finger? (pointing down the hall) Go that way."" with a big smirk.

The location of the property is very convenient as a major train station (Penn Station) is located directly across the street, this made it very easy and convenient to commute throughout the city which is a MAJOR plus for someone who isn’t an experienced New Yorker.The property has a mini store, coffee shop, and gift shop conveniently located in the lobby, and the hotel has access points on almost all 4 blocks on the perimeter of the property with an array of food choices, grocery stores, pharmacies, and shopping stores. We came in with the understanding that the hotel was an older New York hotel and thought we had a decent idea of what to expect. But, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the property is currently undergoing a renovation and so we were able to experience the renovated rooms. The newly renovated rooms give the property a more modern feel, and for being New York City the rooms are rather large and roomy. The rooms are very clean and the bed feels like you are sleeping on a cloud. Every floor has a lounge area by the elevators which are equipped with comfortable couch seating, tables to work on, and a TV which makes it a nice space to relax outside of your room or even to sit and work on a laptop without having to go to the lobby or other floors.  Another aspect that we were pleased with, was the elevator system. Although it's such a large hotel they have a reasonable number of elevators and we never waited longer than 60 seconds to get inside of a lift, even during high traffic times like check in and check out. I know this can be a nuisance in a lot of hotels, where the use of a lift is necessary. The staff throughout the property were all very professional, helpful, and were able to help us with all of our questions and concerns. If you want to experience New York's premier address for value and convenience, Hotel Penn is a great choice.","Montrouge, France","15razielp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montrouge, France</strong>",2,5.0

Continental breakfast was included however it was not in the hotel they give you vouchers you had to walk a half a block and go to this deli where are you got in a line much as you would if were at a soup kitchen and they were pulling the bagels out of cardboard boxes half frozen, with fruit cups with unripe fruit and bitter coffee. On Monday morning when I went to take my shower there was no hot water and I was informed by the front desk to wait at least 15 minutes for hot water that was not an option for me as I had to get to work and nobody I know gets up 15 minutes earlier just to make sure they have hot water at least at a hotel.

Upon entering the room, I was picked to see the carpets so filthy that one couldn't safely walk on the in bare feet. There was black hairs on the bathroom floors. We did not get any face cloths and had only one hand towel. I attempted to call the concierge but on one picked up. I did reach the hotel operator who had them send us the towels later in the day. The walls were soiled as well. I think it would be cleaned and more pleasant to be in a prison cell. I went to the desk to ask to ask for a clean room and was told that they knew the room was dirty. All of the Standard Rooms are dirty. If you want a clean room that has been updated you need to pay an additional $57 for the next level up. Those rooms are better and there is the top level where you would get a room that is in the best condition. I am thankful for the help from Maria at the front desk who did give us an upgrade to the middle level room, w/out having to pay the extra money. The breakfast that is included is at a local restaurant down the street. The provided breakfast is also deplorable. It's not the amount you get that is bad, but the quality. You can pay an additional $10 but when you see the buffet, it too is not something I would want to put in my body. The only good thing about the hotel is the location. That is great! It is really unfortunate that Hotel Pennsylvania had become a dive. I had stayed here four times in the past, and while the room was never posh, it was acceptable and clean. Sadly that is no longer the case. BEWARE is you book the STANDARD room.

For what I paid I was totally satisfied with the place, particularly given its history and superb position in the city.My only criticism was that it took me 45 minutes to check in after a long haul flight at a time which for me was 4.00 a.m. They need more staff on the desks as there is always a queue at whatever time of the day you are in the lobby.","Bexhill-on-Sea, United Kingdom","morwood37</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bexhill-on-Sea, United Kingdom</strong>",47,4.0

It was a great place to sleep after a long day in New York and i was walking distance to various places. So my friends were very pleased on the location. The customer Service was great when we had a small problem with our A/C Unit. They brought us extra towels and sheets when we asked for it. The maid named, Valerie is my only complaint. She was a very nasty and lazy woman. in my opinion, a hotel room does not need to be cleaned everyday. My friends and did not want our room cleaned and Valerie was thrilled. She showed me that she was extremely lazy and kept telling me to dial *35 on the hotel phone do she could get a $15 quote. We just wanted fresh towels for the first 2 days of our visit. On the third day, her manager told her to clean our bathroom because it is company policy, so we complied. Valerie showed me that she did not want to clean and she did a horrible job at it too. When she left, places were still wet and lysol remains were all over the sink and toilet. On the 4th day, she yelled at me saying i left feces on her cart the other day. I didn't do such a thing. She was quite slow the other day so i left all our wet towels and trash outside our hotel door. She than proceed to not even clean our room or leave any new towels. I had to call customer service to bring me some new towels. On the 5th day, i did not have to see her. I'm glad i didn't. The worst thing about her was she kept saying inappropriate things to my friend, ""i kept thinking about you all night"" ""Do you think i can get with you?"" Overall this hotel was great for my friends and I for my trip to New York. . The hotel is in amazing spot and is the perfect spot for tourist.

We were aware that this is hotel is rated with two stars, that it is around 100 years old, and that is has one of the lower rates in the area, but we decided to go anyway because it is conveniently located just across Pennsylvania Station and at walking distance to major sites of interest. This review it to give fellow travelers an idea of what to expect. Being one of the hotels in NY with largest quantity of rooms, it is clearly understaffed. Prepare for really long lines both during check-in and check-out, all day long. Our flight to NY was delayed and instead of arriving at 11 pm, we arrived at 4 am next morning, and our booked room -one of the newly renovated ones- was not available any more. After one hour wait they placed us in a larger room of the older design, but with just one bed. They told us our room would be available that same day after 3 pm. But again, that afternoon, no rooms were available. The second night, after two trips to the front desk and two phone calls, we finally got the sheets and blankets for the sofa bed. The third day we finally understood that the room change was not going to happen. The hotel does not have its own restaurant and the included free breakfast is served somewhere else across the street. The place is small and always crowded, tables and chairs are dirty, and the food is not worth the wait. If you want a nice breakfast, go somewhere else. The lines for elevators are absurd, but don´t even try to take the stairs. We did once and got lost in a maze of unmarked corridors and doors where we met several other desperate guests trying to figure some way out to the lobby. It took us 10 minutes to get back to civilization. Our room was in the 7th floor and had a window towards Madison Square Garden, and I guess the view would have been great if the glass was clean, but it was covered with a thick layer of dust on the outside. Despite all these annoyances, we were out of the hotel most of the time and only came at night to sleep, so it was not so terrible. At the end, it is all part of the adventure. I guess they could improve service a lot by just putting more people at the front desk.",,Victor S,0,2.0

Definitely upgrade or don’t complain. The staff generally bent over backwards to help us. The upgrade was ok, but still needs work. Towel rack was off the wall, literally, the paint and patch job was terrible. Blood stain on my pillow and paint on the curtains. The king bed and pillows were magnificent and comfy and I’m fussy. Great view and clean windows. Little touches needed. Garbage from previous guests was behind the garbage can and under the bed. Housekeeping, bellman( the fellow with the salt and pepper hair was an angel . When I forgot my cane in the room, all loaded down, he ran up to get it!) , front desk, were amazing. Security is lax and we were never asked to show our key despite the sign, though I doubt we gals looked threatening. The checkin is Appalling! Somehow we managed to get in behind only 2 people. During our 6 day stay, we never saw anything but a lobby packed with exhausted travelers in endless lineups to check in. This was at all hours of day and night. The hotel has responded by having more staff on but I travel the world and have never seen anything like this. I would try the auto check in, and just leave your key with the bellman on checkout. The breakfast arrangement is pathetic. Other reviewers said it was like being fed in jail. I was there during a very hot day and having to stand in a roped in huge line beside the hot kitchen, to be handed a tray , was primitive. Not to mention you have to go down and across the street. Heaven help the disabled. The lines for elevators were ridiculous, with about 7 full ones going by before you could get on. Aggressive people were taking advantage of the elderly by pushing past them ,despite them being there first. My daughter had to shame them into being fair. There is much room for improvement, but if management continue to listen, things might improve. The Sports Club next door was nasty, with the pool so scummy, my daughter would not go in. I needed the huge hot tub and sauna for pain relief. Staff was great, except for the one guy who thought I was drunk bc I’m disabled. The free drinks were nice but go to Feille not Stout, as all they want to do is upsell you. Not friendly. On the whole, a decent experience but beware of the extra charges on your room.

Had a horrifying experience my first night. Booked a “Penn 5000” room which was supposed to be a step up from the “classic” rooms, with a mini fridge, pillow top mattress, modern decor, etc. After a 1-hour wait in the check-in line around 8:30pm, I arrived at my room on the 5th floor. It was not what I had booked. It was one of their “classic” rooms - dirty floors, dirty walls, broken shower, sink, and tub. The hallways were filthy and dimly lit, and the sofa near the elevators had massive tears in it. The entire floor looked like it had been abandoned - like nothing I have ever seen. I returned to the lobby, to express that there had been a mistake in the type of room I was provided. I saw that the line was twice as long as it had been earlier, so I phoned the hotel instead. They denied that I had booked a Penn 5000 room, insisting that I had booked the “classic” that I had been given. I phoned Expedia - who confirmed I booked a Penn 5000 room, and who also phoned the hotel directly and confirmed with them as well. Expedia instructed me to go to the front desk, where they would switch my room. I waited in line for 2 hours. While I was in line, the manager announced to all of those waiting in line that they had no rooms available, even though everyone in line had a reservation. He said he would process refunds. It was now around 12midnight. I finally got to speak to someone, who denied that I had booked a Penn 5000 room, even though I was showing them my itinerary, and explained that Expedia had just phoned them. I was then forwarded to the manager, who quickly asked me “Have you been in your room yet? Can we sell it?” as he eyed the lineup of disgruntled people behind me. I was appalled. I had a very important meeting the next morning so gave up and went back to my gross room to try and get some sleep. The next morning I returned to the desk and was upgraded to a Suite on the 17th floor for my 2nd and final night. It was truly lovely - it felt like a different hotel. I now wonder if the middle-of-the-line “Penn 5000” rooms even exist at all, or if it’s just the horrifying “classic” rooms or lovely “suites”. STEER CLEAR of the “classic” or mysterious “Penn 5000” rooms! Great location. ","Halifax, Canada","gbtheriault</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Halifax, Canada</strong>",9,1.0

Im not even sure how to explain how bad this hotel is so I will stick to point form - room was so dirty (used condom wrapper behind bed) and thick dust in corners- we paid $300 per night but no matter what you pay it should be clean- the pillows were stained a really gross dark yellow and prob (15-20years old)- light could not be plugged in beside bed to we had to run the chord across the room- the other light didn't work - bathroom shower must have had water savers on them and it came out as a mist- we wanted to complain when we checked in but the cue was so long at the counter we just gave up as we were exhausted from travelling from Australia - on the day we checked out we shared our concerns with reception and they blamed us for not approaching them in the first instance. I asked her to come for a walk with me to the room so she could see for herself and at that point she said they could give us a partial refund $67 in fact ..... which was TAKEN out of my credit card and not given back as a refund! So a week later I try and contact the hotel ..... 20 min on the line and then I get hung up on waiting in the cue. Another 3 calls later and they transfer me to accounting department and the same thing happens this time I was on hold for 16 min. What a complete joke. Every point of contact with this hotel has been a disaster, a complete failure. If you are studying hospitality or hotel management this is a real cracker of WHAT NOT TO DO and HOW NOT TO RUN A PLACE. All our other experiences in the state of New York were incredible. Unfortunately this hotel falls way below standard and to be quite frank Im a hotel manager myself and I am deeply shocked. They could have turned this around as they had many opportunities to do so but each time they blew it. There are plenty of other hotels to stay at. This one is a dive. You may get one of the refurbished rooms but I can guarantee you will get horrible service. I should have known when I tried to book direct with this hotel and I had difficulty getting through....so we booked through a 3rd party at the end of the day.

There was enamel chipped off the bath, rust evident on doors, thick layers of dust around the bed, old brackets on walls where once an electrical appliance was fixed. The room was badly in need of painting. The TV cabinet wasn't big enough for a TV so the TV was left on top of the cabinet leaving a silly looking hole in the TV unit. The window to the room had a very poor seal so noise at night was an issue. Lift doors, floors and curtains in the lift lobby were filthy! All the attached photos were taken during our stay. There was never enough staff manning reception meaning there are always long queues to check in, check out or to queue to collect the coupons you need to hand in at the deli across the street for the breakfast. The breakfast entails you forming a line in Café R down the streat to be handed pastries out of cardboard boxes and served tea/coffee by rude staff. You can upgrade to a hot and cold self service deli, however the hot food section was, well not that hot.

Check in time took about 1hr as there were only 2 receptionist on duty and a big queue, nobody seemed to be rushing (I`m talking about reception here), very frustrating. We got room on the second floor and when we walked in we were shocked. Room was old and cold, there was a gap between windows. The radiator didn`t work so we asked for engineer to come and two blankets, nothing happened until 8pm (only blankets, no engineer seen). We got our blankets but decided to move rooms anyway. We were asked at the reception to pack our bags and come downstairs with everything so they can move us. Nobody offered help with bags. The new room we got was little better on 8th floor, was little warmer but we noticed a water running in the sink in the bathroom, tap was broken. I went downstairs to report a broken tap and ordered 2 extra blankets just in case room gets cold. They brought us blankets when already in bed, got woken up at 11pm by knocking on the door. We reported a broken tap on several occasions to Duty Manager each morning but nothing was fixed. On one occasion I was in the loby and decided to use public bathroom downstairs but when entering the ladies toilets I got shouted on by one of the housekeepers, who told me that I can`t use this bathroom as I`ve got one in my room. We paid for this accommodation £996 based on 6 nights and we were offered as little as £78 refund for all the inconvenience. We even got charged for storing our bags until collecting them in the afternoon, £5 each.I work at the front desk myself and I can`t imagine treating our guest like that, with no respect or consideration to their needs.

The price was the best for such a great location. A short walk to Time Square. The rail station directly across the street. Lots of shopping nearby if you want that. Indoor mall next to the hotel.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful. My only real disappointment was that the room was very cold which was not good for my 79 yr oldMother. The heater blew some slightly warm air for about 10 minutes and that was it. We called for repair and they came the next day. We had to request extra blankets which we received timely. We had to run the water for 5-10 minutes before it got warm and the shower head for the handicap accessible was broken. It worked but you had to hold it. A minor fix. The towels were fine. The building is 100 years old and could use some upgrades. It still has some of its old charm but could use sprucing up.  No coffee pot in the room but a coffee shop in the lobby with coffees, teas, and a few extras. We used this each morning. The continental breakfast is less than a half block away at R’s Cafe. Not a great selection even compared to the Holiday Inn or Days Inn Suites. Fruit with yogurt in an already served container. Choice of muffin, croissant, bread w/cream cheese, and I believe a bagel (only one item) and a juice or coffee. No seconds. I wasn’t thrilled with the stand in the cafeteria line style service. They do however have a great looking breakfast kitchen in this same location serving all sorts of yummy food. We also found a great diner not to far, about two blocks. Unfortunate that this historical hotel doesn’t have its own restaurant open inside but with the amount of people flowing through they wouldNeed a very large staff to accommodate all the guests.

However, when we checked in, we needn't have worried at all. I'm not sure if everyone on here was just unlucky, or stayed in a different hotel. We had nothing to complain about at all. First things first, the location is amazing - a really short walk to Times Square and literally less than a minute into the Subway or Penn Station. You couldn't ask for a more convenient Midtown location. You're surrounded by food outlets, shops and bars and the Empire State looms overhead. It's ideal. Secondly, what a history this place has! I know that doesn't matter to everyone, but seriously read up about it to really appreciate it. Built by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1919, and host to all kinds of well known celebrities over the years, the history lingers in every corner - from the original valet doors, to the art deco styling in the lobby. Our floor even had a window into one of the original pantries with authentic artefacts and historical photos. Fascinating stuff. Yes, age had made some parts of the hotel look a little worn and tired, but not in a way that detracts from your stay. And, as for the rooms themselves - there's nothing wrong with them. OK, they're simple not luxurious and, in places, slightly shabby. They would benefit from a lick of paint here, a deep clean there. There were some marks on the wall and the enamel was coming off the bath around the drain. But the room was very clean and comfortable, the bathroom looked quite recently updated. The shower was hot and powerful, toiletries were provided, the flat screen tv worked well, the very big bed was very comfortable, there was a desk and a chair and a chest of drawers - and even a small fridge which was very useful. Plenty of fresh towels provided, and the linen was crisp and clean. It really had everything you need from a hotel room - not luxurious, but perfectly comfortable and pleasant, and a nice sanctuary after a busy day. We booked through Booking.com and it seemed to make the check in and check out process much easier for us than for some other guests - this is a big, busy hotel and there is always a line at reception, but we got through quickly and efficiently. Our booking included free Wifi - password provided at check in - and a daily continental breakfast (which is served at a cafe just down the road and consists of fruit, yogurt, a bagel, pastry or muffin and a drink). We paid upfront - taking note of the nightly charges which we clear on the Booking.com website - and it was all very easy. Reception staff were nothing but helpful and friendly. You can store luggage in the downstairs room for $5 per item - this is much cheaper than other local luggage storage facilities and is a manned facility. Anything to complain about? Not really. There's not much of a view from the window - just of the other parts of the hotel - but this is central Manhattan after all! The lobby is always incredibly busy, and sometimes so are the elevators. And the walls are quite thin meaning you will hear people passing your room or with their TVs on loud - but this is no different to any other hotel I've stayed in. All in all - we loved staying at the Hotel Penn and will make it our first option when we return to Manhattan - for value, convenience and a very comfortable, clean place to stay.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","Rebecca B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",102,5.0

The cancellation this far in advance meant it was free, however, the hotel took a full payment as soon as I cancelled.

Possible drawbacks: 1. This hotel makes a business, apparently, of serving large tourist groups. This means that elevators can take a loooong time: elevators will be full when you're trying to go down (meaning you might wait for 3 + elevators stop before you can get on, and the line to get an elevator from the lobby UP can also be a time-consuming process. 2. The hotel's built-in ""breakfast included"" is a ticket to a buffet across the street where they herd you like cattle in a very intense setting. I declined my breakfast ticket but ventured into the store/cafe for personal shopping and was very glad I had declined that option. 3. As noted, the hotel is definitely a draw for large tourist groups, including high school students. My second night there was a lot of loud activity in my hall and then in the room next to mine as I was trying to sleep.4. The line for check-in or service was always long, since there were always tour groups needing to be accommodated. Similarly, the lobby itself was essentially always full of people waiting, feeling more like an extension of nearby Penn Station than an actual hotel.In short: I booked this hotel at the last minute because it fit my company price constraint (and was essentially the only one that did in the vicinity). The room itself, and the gym access, made it a good value for money. But as a professional or as a private, non-tourgroup tourist, this would not be my choice as to how to experience NYC.","Kansas City, Missouri","Lesley P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",17,3.0

Had stayed in this hotel several times so knew that it was not great. This time it was even worse. When I had booked the hotel I had asked for 2 separate beds but the receptionist said our room had a double bed only but she would check if anything was available. As we had ended up tax which we didn't know we had to pay she wouldn't charge extra for the room. It was an awful room, paint hanging of the shirtings and walls. The bed was the worst, the mattress was bigger than the base so you had to be careful where you sat or it would collapse to the floor. Every time you moved the bed squeaked, so uncomfortable. There was no covers on the beds, only a bottom sheet, and two sheets with a blanket between them. Such an awful experience, will not be staying in this hotel ever again.
