This time we spent four days in adjoining rooms while visiting family, and travelling with family. It was a fabulous experience. The high point was literally the pool which overlooked a lot of the high rises in Manhattan. The stay seemed in another age, although it was only a little over two months back. I was doing laps while there were a couple of more swimmers. That is something unimaginable in the days of the Covid virus lockdown. The bar has great views of Central Park and they go out of the way to help hotel residents find a good table. My son also used the speakesy and was mighty pleased to invite his friends over. The best touch was placing a carefully selected book by your bedside which was yours to keep. Extremely civilised. The concierge team in the hotel also made some really nice suggestions.","New Delhi, India","GoggleEyedTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Delhi, India</strong>",55,5.0

All outdated but the price hasn’t changed. Quite tricky as far as benefits are concerned, we had a $300 credit but they quite conveniently forgot to mention that the main bar will not extend any credit given by the hotel what a sham. We stayed for four nights and thought we were using our credits but at checkout found that only $32 was used from our $300. Shameful form a five star establishment. We were booked to come back again on March 07 but we cancelled. Will avoid this particular property of Mandarin.

Had wonderful service with every employee that we interacted with and enjoyed the view of the Hudson River from our room on the 45th floor. The location is great, right on Columbus Circle directly adjacent to Central Park. There are plenty of bike rental options right outside. The hotel lobby is on the 35th floor of the building complex. It's also connected to the mall for shopping and dining options. There are so many things to explore outside of this building, but it's nice to have something connected in case you can't go outside because of the weather. They have larger rooms for a larger price, but we opted for the smaller size room. For NYC, it was still ample size to move around the bed. The bathroom is large and extends the full length of the room. I've been the MO in SF which I found the room much larger, but this is NYC after all. I have a few tips.... 1) regarding their lounge... make reservations if you think you may want to have a drink or eat there. We got lucky with getting a seat for drinks and dessert, but it appears that it fills up and there isn't a bar that you can just stand around and hang out... you must be seated. 2) Join their free Fan club - it provided us with a few perks like late checkout in the afternoon and a $50 credit towards our food bill.

During my time there; I stayed at 3 different hotels. The Mandarin was the worst hotel by far. The star I am giving them is for the pool. The first night I was there I wanted to have a glass of champagne in the lobby before dinner. My guest and I went down to the lobby around 7 pm. It was packed with people and there was not a bar available. Considering that I went over to the front desk and kindly asked if I could grab a lobby seat and have Champagne in the lobby. The front desk woman, Anita, loudly in a high pitched voice “Madame! No! You will have to check in with the hostess and wait to be seated in the restuarant!” First off, Madame? I am not French or in France. Next this is the first time I’ve asked for a glass of Champagne and someone has said “No!” So forcefully only my life. Do you imagine staying at a hotel that charges almost $2k a night and being refused a glass of champagne? Absurd. We go check in at the hostess stand and they say it is a 20 minute wait. My guest and I have no choice but to now go sit in the lobby without a refreshment. However, there are people in the lobby with drinks and some drunk girl spills her drink on the table I’m sitting at. See picture below. When the drink is spilled Anita comes over, because she sees I am infuriated and mortified. She cleans up the drink and I look at Anita and say “this is disgusting” Anita turns to me and in a high pitched tone borderline yelling “she just spilled it MADAME”! At that point Anita should of said nothing and kindly apologized. I asked how they had drinks and we did not. She did not answer the question and walked away. I am blown away at how disgustingly rude she is. We ended up finally getting seated. Had one refreshment then headed to dinner. After dinner I was headed to my room. Anita happened to be in the elevator with me and did not acknowledge my presence. She was being very kind to the gentleman in the elevator.She is the rudest person I have ever met. I vacation often. Never have been treated this poorly. This past week I stayed at the Mandarin Boston. The level of service is impeccable there. Whoever is running that hotel should run a workshop to fix the NYC property. In addition to being denied a glass of champagne I asked for a bathrobe when I was at the pool and it took 45 minutes to find one.","Chicago, Illinois","Jaclyn M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",2,1.0

It was a very pleasant stay. The arrival experience was the best I think I've ever had at any hotel. A woman warmly greeted me in the crowded lower lobby, asked if I was checking in, then when I said yes, she cleared a path for me through the crowd to the elevator, chatting with me in a friendly and casual manner. Then when I got to the front desk on the 35th floor, I was very impressed by Aneta, who was so warm and professional as she checked me in, smiling and talking with me the whole time. There was a minor mixup with my info on file, but the experience was still superb because of Aneta's personable manner. She's definitely a role model. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were friendly and effective, from the concierges to housekeeping to Asiate restaurant at breakfast. In addition to the Carnegie Hall concert, hotel was a great base for exploring MoMA, Central Park, Neue Galerie, Met museum, Lincoln Center, and attending a Broadway show (took the subway right outside hotel). My Central Park view room was great. Wish the lobby was a little bigger but I could usually find a seat. Checkout experience was very good too. When I asked for a copy of MO Magazine to take with me, the front desk woman made sure that I got it. It was an expensive stay but worth it. This was my third visit in about 5 years.

I had booked this hotel based on the brand name (we have loved the quiet oasis, gorgeous rooms, stellar service at many Mandarins) and the reviews here. I used Amex Fine hotels and resorts, thank goodness-they got us our money back and found another hotel within five minutes. I had prepaid and by the time we arrived the room we had booked was $400 less due to a special. We did not receive an upgrade. The room was tiny and grubby. The view was great. The hotel bar lobby was filled with very loud and drunk people, including one woman calling people the B word in high volume. Not what I expect from a Mandarin. I tried to get a different room, but they only one offered was a suite for an additional $600. The manager, Stacy, was not who I would hire for that position. As we left to check into the Four Seasons, where we got a suite for the same price we were paying for this tiny dirty room, one of the MO employees apologized and guessed the name of the manager. Evidently many guests are not very happy with her. There are so many fabulous hotels in NY, skip this one.","San Francisco, California","Renatad4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",57,1.0

Without batting an eye, she gets on her cell, calls someone, takes my jacket, and in 10 minutes returns with it all taken care of. Clearly not in her job description, but she knows and fully understands the hospitality business. She is absolutely the best. That's not to say all the other people we interacted with were any less.

I was a quite disappointed to hear that I cannot get an complimentary upgrade from the highest room category to a suite because of an internal policy. Paid upgrade would have doubled the price and given almost no discount on list price.Rooms and all public spaces seem quite aged and need to be renovated within next years to keep up. In Aviary, all tables have deep scratches, and the room decor is quite worn. Also, you had to switch off lights individually and there is no electric curtains or so.

The location is, obviously, super convenient to many attractions and areas of NYC. My room was surprisingly not-small and it was well appointed, good-looking and comfortable with a beautiful view. The bathroom layout and shower were great. The two room service meals I ordered were excellent. The service was almost perfect. There is coffee available in the morning either by the front desk on the 35th floor or the restaurant will give you a to-go cup. I also like that housekeeping puts ice in your ice bucket every day so when you get back to the room at the end of the day, it's there waiting for you. The only service failure was when I called to housekeeping to ask for a small scissors, and the scissors were never sent.

This tells you that the MO is actually on my good side. My significant other pushed her favored hotel, I lived in NY for some time but stayed only in pre-booked hotels ever since. I wanted to check out the MO so I pushed for it.Our agent booked a room that would get us the MO upgrade to a 950$ room. The upgrade happened. Findings:See attached pictures. I am still totally baffled by the poorly maintained room that was run down, tapestry rolling off, smears and dust everywhere. The room was gloomy and dreary even with all lights on and the sun out in full. Reality is a mile off the photoshopped web version. That's not unusual, yet I can say that visual gap at the MO in HK is nothing like what I experienced in NY. The same goes for the furniture and bathroom hardware/shower that is made to look high end, yet it's more common to flimsy budget department stores than what one would be used to from high priced premium brand hotels.Worst of all:I practically had to live in an elevator shaft due to the constant elevator noise that could be day and night, and EXTREEMLY annoying. 950$ for a room that has an elevator running through it day and night?! My wife had a friend join her, she experienced the same noise in a different room, and my wife was equally annoyed my the rolling elevator sound. So I am not a hypochondriac making a fuss. The MO NY did not drop on our list of NY hotels. It's now #1 on the list of to be avoided by all means hotels in NY; within the category of 5 star premium brand hotels. Rooms of the quality we experienced go for around 350$ if you do your homework, which I obviously did not do. I hope this feedback leads to a few empty rooms per year and helps others from overpaying for a hotel that's not worth it. I am writing this while residing in the MO HK as we speak.

I made our reservation over the phone a long time before our trip, asking for a room as high up as possible and near the southern corner of the building. I confirmed this request by email a week later, confirmed it about a month before the trip, then called two days before our arrival to specify our request again. Each time we were told: ""We can't hold a specific room for you, but it shouldn't be a problem."" When we finally got there, we were given a choice between a room more or less facing south but TEN FLOORS below the top, or a room 4 floors below the top, but facing north. I don't see why the hotel can't honour a simple request for someone who is staying 5 nights in one of the highest categories of rooms.Once we had checked in and deposited our luggage in the room which did indeed have a nice view (though not the one we were expecting), we went back into the lobby and asked to enter the bar just to take a look for a few seconds. We were told that this WAS NOT POSSIBLE! At the restaurant, the hostess allowed us to take 2 steps in, but then ushered us out! We were told that this is hotel policy, but what did they think we were going to do? Stand on top of the other guests? To be treated as a potential troublemaker when you are just asking for a discreet visit is rather insulting.On the positive side, when we did enter the restaurant the next morning for breakfast, the staff was very nice, and Brian at the front desk was very helpful.","Paris, France","SteveSavatte</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",679,3.0

We split our trip into 3 nights near Central Park and 3 nights near the World Trade Center. During our Central Park stay, we chose the Mandarin Oriental New York because of the great reviews, views and pool. Yes - it has an indoor pool!! It is one of very select few hotels in the city that does. And the location can not be beat. Walking distance to Central Park, it is also attached to the Shops at Columbus Circle / Time Warner Center including a Whole Foods. Super convenient!Service from check in to check out and everything in between has been flawless. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the doormen where they collected our luggage and directed us to the 35th floor for check-in. At check-in, we were given an upgrade to a Premier Central Park view room on the 45th floor by friendly front desk staff because we booked through a travel agent that had access to MO’s “Fan Club” rates. She explained all the perks of the rate at the MO like upgrade at check-in, complimentary breakfast for 2 people, and $100 food or spa credit. There is a separate elevator bank that take you to the rooms near the spa. After 7 pm, you have to use your key card. All the rooms at the MO are the same size but with slightly different layouts (except the suites - but they don’t generally comp upgrade to suites, so you gotta shell out money for those). Anyway, since we were there for our kiddo’s birthday week, they gave us a rollaway bed at no extra charge. There were a couple books in the room for the kids that we were able to bring home too. The king bed room was the perfect size to add a rollaway and we still had space to stretch out a tiny bit. The room is big for NYC standards and had a separate bathtub and shower. Online said they had some bathtub toys for kids, but when we called they didn’t have any - just bath safety items (whale themed nonslip mat, knee pad for the parents, spigot cover, drain cover, and thermometer) which was nice too and appreciated. We hardly heard any hallway or outside noise during our stay.We chose to eat at in-room dining for our breakfast and one of the dinners. The food is always excellent, but they sometimes forgot to bring certain items though they were quick to send them up when we called back. As for coffee - no, there are no coffee makers in the room. You can either buy coffee through room service OR if you call guest services, they will bring you an old school coffee maker and coffee grinds (the maker and coffee arrive separate) so you can make your own coffee. These are not pods, so you kind of had to experiment a little with water and amount of grinds. For us, 2 bottles of drinking water and the entire bowl of coffee brewed the perfect cup of Joe.Another perk of the hotel is its complimentary house car available to all guests on a first come first served basis within about a 10 block radius. We had the same driver when we went to Times Square for the M&M store and then again a different day to Nobu Fifty Seven. It was such a great service to have a friendly and professional driver available for these trips. He was awesome! Nice small talk conversation and even gave us some helpful tips for our visit. There are also water bottles and wet wipes in the car. Don’t forget to tip - these guys deserve it! Really refreshing, especially after experiencing some not so friendly or professional uber drivers. FYI - the MO car service doesn’t pick back up though, only drop-off service.And last but not least, the pool and fitness center on the 36th floor. It is open to all guests. It’s not huge, but quite adequate. Attendants check you in on your first visit and then remember you the rest of your stay. There is a fruit tray right outside the pool and an infused water dispenser in the fitness center. The pool is a long narrow lap pool that starts at 3.5’ and ends at 4’. The attendants are also lifeguards so they watch you while you swim or play. They even had a couple kick boards, pool noodles, and toddler life vest you can borrow during your swim. They also check to see if you need any water bottles when you leave. We were super impressed with the amenities and the staff.Overall, we could not have asked for a better introduction to NYC. The Mandarin Oriental New York was the perfect 5-star hotel for our stay. We are now continuing our stay near the World Trade Center and wish we were back at the MO.

It's one of the best in NYC. My thoughts are best broken down into the following bullet points:35th FLOOR/RECEPTION:- Lobby, reception and bar are top-tier. - Francesca (sp?) at the front desk is the best employee at the hotel. Outgoing, warm and enthusiastic she is one of the top reasons for returning.- The hotel bar (Aviary) is frustrating as it is a bit of a tourist attraction in and of itself. While it's annoying you can't just saunter up to a table, I've had no issues requesting one an hour or two in advance from the concierge. - The drinks at the aforementioned Aviary are amazing. Really creative and fun. The price point is expensive to the extreme, especially for the food. They are charging, on average, $20-$30 for a few bites. For 5 of us, each having two drinks and a couple bites, it wound up being $600. I almost fell over.ROOM:- When compared to other hotels of this price point, the rooms feel a bit dated: No designated USB ports, lots of light switches as opposed to an integrated system, etc. - The bed and linens were a tier or two below what you'd expect. It was hard and springy. Linens rough and unpleasant. Oddly, I was able to move from a ""Hudson River view"" to a ""Central Park View"" and the linens in the new room seemed quite a bit softer than the previous ones. It was odd. You'd think they'd be consistent throughout. This newer view also made the room seem quite a bit larger thanks to a revised layout that widened the room while placing the bathroom nearer the corridor. - Bathrooms are spacious and nice. You'd think the tubs would be a little larger but they are manageable. ETC:- The laundry is the most expensive I've encountered. Overnight service for a couple shirts and socks came to $200. No idea if it was a billing error or not, but it was insanely expensive for some basic cleaning sans a suit or tux.","Los Angeles, California","JustinBrandonLA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",80,4.0

Excellent location opposite Central Park, walking distance to the theatre district, Lincoln Center, great shopping within the the multilevel Time Warner building. The westside neighborhood offers very good shopping (chains and boutiques) and local restaurants. The view from the room, restaurant and lounge overlook Central Park, the city skyline from Central Park South to 5th Avenue on the east side.Upon arriving in the ground floor lobby our suitcases were whisked away and we were directed to take an elevator to the 35th floor where we were warmly greeted by reception. After registration we were escorted to our room on the 42nd floor. All along the front desk person talked about the hotel and how the access cards work. Once in the room it was fairly straightforward how things worked and soon thereafter our luggage arrived as did complimentary hot tea.When booking our reservation we were given a choice of rooms facing Central Park or the Hudson River. As all of the rooms are on high floors they are relatively quiet from any street noise, however, we did on occasion hear a screaming kid running up the hallway which is surprising as one doesn’t hear any noise from the rooms next door. Beside being a spacious room with king bed, there was a long, comfortable chaise lounge by the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the park. The bed was extremely comfortable (not too firm and not too soft) and the edges of the mattress were reinforced to prevent sagging from sitting on the edge of the mattress and rolling over (if sleeping on one’s side). The bed linens and pillow fill were very nice as were the towels. The room has an accurate thermostat and we were able to set the temperature to our liking. There is complimentary water and turn down services. My only suggestions would be to add a night light and exhaust fan in the bathroom.The decor is contemporary with tasteful, oriental accents, indoor plants and orchids, and nothing is over the top. The curated colours, textures and design are elegant, calming and rich.The restaurant has an excellent array of food offerings and service is of a high standard. We did experience some families with screaming and crying children that were indifferent to others in the lovely restaurant. It’s accepted that young, affluent families stay in nice hotels, however, MO might want to consider a policy for under the age of 12 children where families can dine separately from couples and power meeting breakfasts. It’s a very mellow restaurant and the lack of mindfulness doesn’t project the MO allure.There is no traditional lobby. Instead MO offers a scenic lounge on the 35th floor adjacent to the restaurant and reception area which is the perfect place for cocktails and small snacks. Reservations for drinks during cocktail hour are recommended especially if you’d like to sit near the window seats. The afternoon we arrived, we observed a few very loud children standing on the leather sofas in the lounge. Perhaps MO should consider a safe, designated playroom where children can express themselves without projecting themselves on other guests. It was a lovely 3 day weekend and by far the nicest hotel we’ve stayed in NY. As we visit NY quite frequently, we hope to make MO our new go to hotel as it had everything we could hope for and more.","Ottawa, Canada","ottawa198</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",127,5.0

When you add to this the fact that the hotel is new and extremely well maintained, the rooms are large (for NYC) and the position is great, it's really an unbeatable combination. We recently spent 3 days here, celebrating our anniversary. Even though we're locals, we wanted to treat ourselves and chose the hotel b/c it has a wonderful spa and a long pool. To our surprise (it's not advertised) it also has a sauna. Although the hotel was full, we were mostly alone in the pool, and the spa was not overly crowded. The rooms with Central Park views were sold out when we booked, but this extremely helpful guy at the front desk found one for us (a room that is normally part of a suite, but was not being used as such). So call them if your room of choice is sold out, they might find a solution. The view towards Central Park is amazing!A special kudos to house-keeping. I'm not sure we've ever seen bathrooms that shiny or carpets that clean. Also, unlike every other hotel we've stayed in, they organized our toiletries in helpful ways (I'm constantly annoyed when someone un-does my arrangements, but these people made them better). We got exactly what we were hoping from our stay here: a few relaxed days with long swimming and gym sessions, a few luxurious hours in the spa, great views, and just steps from two of our favorite bakeries (Bouchon and Kayser).

The concierge had been amazingly helpful with securing dinner reservations and lunch suggestions. However, the front desk could make some improvements. I had notified the hotel weeks in advance that I was coming with my family for our babymoon. However, on arrival the gentleman that was checking me in was disinterested and made no acknowledgement that I was here for a special occasion. Furthermore, the couple next to me was being upgraded and given multiple room choices for their room upgrade. On the other hand,there was no mention of an upgrade for my stay despite my stay being booked with FHR program. Very limited on-site dining options and the only restaurant available for lunch has strict cut off times. We had checked into the hotel at 1:30 pm and went directly to the restaurant at 2:05 pm and was told they were no longer seating for lunch after 2:00 pm. We also had our young son with us and there was no special welcome gesture that we have come to expect from other brands like the Four seasons or The Ritz. The hotel does have a unique place to grab a cocktails at the Aviary bar. Very creative cocktails with great views! Overall, I would likely check out one of the other central Park hotels next time I come to NYC.

Over our 3 night stay the staff were invariably courteous, professional and responsive which makes a great difference on vacation, even stretching to looking after our bikes whilst we lunched. The rooms are elegant and the beds luxuriously comfortable. Why the fallen star? Although our agent booked over 4 months in advance requesting rooms on the same floor for our daughter, we arrived tired after a 14 hour journey to be informed at 4pm, our room would not be ready until well after 5pm (check-in is allegedly 3pm). We were eventually offered a room 4 floors away from our daughter. The shower was defective in this room. (An engineer eventually came to fix it).

They were right about the view it really is a good one from the 35th floor. The service however was really rather poor. The colleague who greeted us and showed us to a great seat was lovely and friendly. After at least five minutes another colleague came with some drinks menus and eventually some water. He didn’t seem to reappear and after about ten minutes we got someone else’s attention to order a couple of beers. These even then took quite a while to be served and when the colleague went to pour one of them he did a terrible job, creating a lot of froth and not much beer in the glass! I would have expected any server to be able to pour a beer without too much trouble! So it’s definitely worth a trip up to the bar for the view but don’t expect great service.

Paid upgrade to move to Premiere Central Park Suite, a room that normally goes for 2600 (?!!). The front desk was awesome in arranging my move. Truly great service! However the room itself, you hear a fair amount of noise from above. I’ve never had that in a hotel before. Just shoes on the floor above, endlessly. The much bigger issue is the blackout drapes don’t really black out. I called for someone to help at about 6am when it was already fairly bright, and maintenance agreed it seemed weird for such an expensive suite to have curtains that don’t overlap. He tried (as I did) to push them together but didn’t work. They also left gap at the wall. He offered to come back later with tape to try and tape them to the wall and together. That just seems a little low rent for Mandarin— for something a thousand dollars more than Park Hyatt’s much nicer city view suite (where I didn’t need tape!Service at Hyatt not nearly as good but sleep wins!) So in summation: staff is super nice— manager heard about curtains and at check out apologized saying he wish he knew it was issue at check in (not sure how I’d know before dawn) but small rooms and the suite (at least #4500) can’t sleep much past dawn.

I tell you, the tiny school-girl swinging her arms about at the next table & showing me Mickey in the ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" was absolutely right. Since our Mandarin Oriental hotel visit here in New York City, we now stop by whenever we're in the area & have been waiting to try out THE AVIARY, the new lobby bar & small-plate café designed by Chicago cocktail Svengali, Grant Achatz. The Aviary is quite pleasurable & I for one had already been a loyal fan of this grande space for several years. Now, gazing up at the sweeping new overhead light installation, it did indeed appear that Mickey Mouse was magically conducting the swirling back & forth-shaped illumination dancing across the ceiling. The Aviary is located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel lobby which features panoramic views 35 floors over Central Park that regularly melt the heart of even the most seasoned traveler. Swirling lines of the ceiling lights are picked up again by sweeping lamp-stands curving up & over massive sectional couches & dropping down-light over the central seating areas. They add dynamic whimsy to an already magnificent space.Known from the start for its promise of ""atomic"" cocktails theatrically steaming with dry-ice explosions of brandy & bourbon & tequila, I confessed today that I had never actually seen one of these concoctions being served & only knew them from photos, since I usually come to the hotel at lunch-time. To my delighted surprise, the Bar Manager, Berit Soli-Holt, graciously indulged me with an amazing personal demonstration, up in the bar's staging area. The Aviary cocktails are crafted by ""liquid chefs"" at an expansive bar space displayed behind floor-to-ceiling glass which stretches the length of The Aviary above & behind us, while we guests gaze out at Central Park. As Berit told me the story of The Aviary, she produced wonderful rum-spiced steam rushing over the counter from a slim-necked chemist beaker at the bar. All of this inspired me to try out her suggestion of a ""Boom,"" as she called it, with my salad. This is the special cocktail known as ""Boom Goes the Dynamite,"" in which she stirred up a combination of rums, vanilla, violet — with just a gourmet touch of ver-jus and ""rooibos,"" which is some sort of South African herb. After a few minutes of fragrant rum explosion at my table, a straw was playfully served — although I preferred a glass, which was delivered frozen, to best set off the flavors of the drink.Both times I've enjoyed the chicken sandwich, it has been delivered by the chef himself & combined a spicy fried chicken cutlet dressed with creamy sauce & lightly pickled cucumber slices ever-so-carefully fanned out on a sesame bun. Most dishes — such as my Orchard Salad today — are garnished with colorful flourishes of edible blossoms, often pansies, fresh plucked from the stem. The little movie-savvy princess & her mother were gone by the time I finished a cappuccino, but I will always remember her imaginatively ""conducting"" the ceiling lights like Mickey Mouse for me.","New York City, New York","VKMc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",53,5.0

Overall the stay was comfortable. Rooms were nice (albeit bit tired) and bathroom was spacious. The room was not as nice as the picture on the MO website for our category but comfortable. One should not expect the service levels of MO in Asia or any nice chain in Asia. Second, at this price point, I think there are several hotels in NY that are much nicer (such as the Park Hyatt, The Peninsula and St Regis). We have also stayed at several mid-tier hotels (mostly W’s) and have found the rooms and service to be at least as nice for less than half the price. The night we checked in, we were disappointed to see that the bathroom had not been properly cleaned and there were several strands of hair in the shower. Also, when they did the turn-down service, they did not leave chocolate mint by the hotel – they were happy to bring it if you called and were actually surprised that it wasn’t already there – on all 3 nights.Breakfast at Asiate was nice. The Aviary is the best part of the hotel – it is in the hotel but managed by the Alinea group of Chicago. If you are staying at the hotel, you don’t need to book on Aviary website, which requires a non-refundable deposit. We ordered BF in room one morning and it the room service would not answer the phone despite long tries. Eventually, the operator was able to connect – again not what you would expect in a 4-star, let alone the fact that this is a 5-star.Overall, I would not stay here again given the awesome choices in this awesome city.","San Jose, CA","CAWorldtraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, CA</strong>",362,3.0

This was our first stay at the Mandarin Oriental and I think it is fair to say we will struggle to stay anywhere else now. Our room was a good size for a New York hotel and had amazing views of Columbus Circle and Central Park. It only lacked a coffee maker other than that everything we needed was there. Housekeeping was incredible, they tidied and refreshed with attention to detail such as replacing a small tube of toothpaste when they spotted we had run out and making the bed and changing the towels even though we were a late check out. The best we have ever experienced anywhere in the world. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning, it is a table service breakfast so no opportunity to help yourself at the buffet, this makes service a little slow and we had quite a wait one morning although we were given coffee in the lobby as we waited. Orders arrived wrong and we had to send the toast back to ask for it be actually toasted! So maybe a little fine tuning required on the breakfast front. Other than that guests can dine in the hotel or take a quick spin in the elevator down to floor three where there is a plethora of dining opportunities within Columbus Circle. The concierge was very helpful and knew the magic words to get tables at restaurants that were packed. Thanks Concierge team! The Aviary bar in the hotel is great fun with a madcap scientist approach to drinks so we had a slingshot that had to be cracked to reveal the drink, a steaming glass flask that contained a the drink and a ship in a bottle to name but three! Not cheap but a great bit of theatre, and the drinks a good too. There is also The Office which is like a speakeasy hidden behind a door. There is a well equipped gym, a lap pool and a spa that is right there on floor 35 where you check in rather than hidden in the subterranean depths of the hotel as they very often are.From Columbus Circle all of New York is at your feet with subway stations nearby and Central Park across the street the location couldn't be better.

The rooms are small but well-furnished and bathrooms are top-notch. The location is very convenient since you are inside Columbus Circle so there are a variety of restaurant and shopping options without ever having to step outside (if there is inclement weather). Service is fine. There have been a couple snafus with reservations but never anything major. Biggest con is room service menu seems to have exaggerated prices along with their in-hotel restaurant. However, they do have a lovely speakeasy-style bar that serves amazing cocktails and an amazing shareable icecream sundae.

We pretty much dealt with our own cases and made our way in, we were directed to the lift by somebody inside the ground floor entrance and up we went to the 35 floor. Usually in hotels of this magnitude your bags are whisked and you are ushered to reception by a member of the front door team, this was noticeable but wasn't any major concern. Check-in lady was excellent & efficient and took us up to our Hudson-Twin. I was travelling with my friend and we were in NY for the Opera. Twin rooms are invariably the lower category rooms in deluxe hotels from my experience, this twin was lovely and comfortable, although due for its twenty year refurb now as the decor is looking tired and dated. No fruit in the room but I guess this is because of our lower category room. No heated towel-rail in bathroom or heated floor, which is pretty standard these days in top hotels, but the general layout of the bathroom was good with great shower and bath with a view. The room was very comfortable with quality furnishings and fixtures, albeit nearly twenty years old. The room had a nice walk-in closet with space for our things. Beds/linen top quality, super-comfortable, the glassware, crockery etc was quality, tea/coffee-making facilities in-room were very good, fresh-ground coffee and percolator provided to make lovely fresh coffee instead of those awful 'pod' machine things that many hotels are using these days. Fresh milk provided in silver jug which kept it cool. These were good finer details. There was no magnifying mirror fixture in the bathroom but we phoned down for one and an excellent illuminated portable one was delivered within ten minutes. Excellent body products in the bathroom, re-stocked generously. Housekeeping and turn-down was good, but only received bedtime pillow chocolate on the first of our four nights. Complimentary bottled water generously provided in room. Room service was prompt and the fresh milkshake brought up to my room late at night was delicious. The restaurant was beautiful, it's had a fairly recent make-over and the views of Central Park and Midtown are awesome. Breakfast was delicious, delicious freshly-squeezed Grapefruit juice, delicious Canadian proper bacon, all five star, and the management team and servers are extremely pleasant and professional. We didn't manage to get a window seat on our visits to the restaurant but this was no big deal. We got great views and photo moments from the Ballroom upstairs, it was not in use during our stay and on a couple of mornings after my swim I sneaked in to sit in the window to admire the views! The hotel reception area is beautiful, although it too is due for a modernisation I am led to believe. Concierge guy, William if I remember, was excellent and very knowledgeable about his great City. The Pool was great, big enough for a good workout, the Pool room was a bit on the cold side, not sure if this was because I went down early morning, but with small kids this area would be too cold, air-con blowing cold during winter in a big pool area made for a very cold space. Pool attendants were polite and professional. My morning sauna was not the best, it just got colder and colder and after 30 mins in there I realised it was not working correctly. I went to the guy at the Pool desk and he came and fiddled with it and said it had shut itself down, he said it would be lovely and hot the following morning but it wasn't ever really up to usual Sauna temperatures. Also, the Sauna floor under the boards looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in quite a long time. For a hotel of this rating this basic hygiene slacking was disappointing. Pool changing area and gym were of a good standard with nice ice-cold citrus water machine and fruit basket laid on. There was a slight issue with our usage of the Spa facilities, we'd gone down to use the facilities and was told by a Spa member of staff that the vitality pool and steam room were not working, but then when we got back to our room and rang down and complained to the duty-manager that we hadn't checked into supposedly the best hotel in NY to then learn that the vitality pool & steam room wasn't working, she got straight on the case and we were invited straight back down to use the facilities. It was obvious to me that the Spa member of staff was attempting to reserve the Spa for people coming for treatments and for members maybe, thus attempting to usher hotel guests back to their rooms with lame stories about facilities not working. This is a very poor philosophy as the simple fact is, without paying hotel guests there would be no Spa. I realise that they are offering a deluxe service for Spa treatment customers, but this must not be to the detriment of the hotel guests who rightfully wish to come and have a steam and wallow in the vitality pool. This issue was dealt with promptly by management and my friend and I were welcomed to use the Spa facilities for the duration of our four night stay, and the standard usage charges were wavered for all of our Spa visits, which made amends and reconfirmed my trust in the MO brand. It has to be said that the Spa is now in need of modernisation, the relaxation room/beds are very comfortable and the Spa changing rooms well fitted, but the vitality pool space does now need refurbishment, floor tiles etc need replacing around the vitality pool and in the showers. The steam room is dated although it is a quality steam room, and as usual for MO hotels, the vitality pool is great, hot and powerful, although it did stop a few times and the man had to come and jiggle buttons to get it going again. For all of the little niggles, I still loved my time at the MONY, once the bedrooms, main reception, Spa thermal area etc are modernised, there is no reason why the MO cannot claim to be the best hotel in New York and certainly back up there with Four Seasons, Peninsular and Park Hyatt. I would certainly consider choosing the MO on my next visit to New York...

Our room wasn’t ready, so we decided to have a quick bite at The Aviary NYC before our matinee -- other luxury hotels welcome guests with a bit of bubbly, unfortunately, not Mandarin Oriental. When we got back to MO after dinner, we were given our keys. Our room was on the 48th floor and we had high expectations, until we walked in and found two twin beds! Seriously? Both Hilton and Marriott can accommodate with two queens, or doubles at the very least. We were appalled that a luxury property, with 4-figure nightly rates, provides twin beds to adult guests. The chocolate treat delivered to celebrate the birthday was too little, too late. Upon waking, we found our view blocked by the mirrored side of the building next door. The live orchid in the bathroom was a nice touch; however, one of the lights over the sink was dark and remained so through the duration of our stay. Furthermore, the furniture was oddly placed: while there was a floor lamp in the corner of the room, there was no chair. There was a tiny chaise at the end of one of the twins, but no chaise at the end of the other. Since we saw no complementary coffee in the lobby, we decided to have breakfast at Asiate. While the food was good, no cold croissant is worth $30 – not even in NYC. Shame on MO! Luckily, The Spa at Mandarin Oriental did not disappoint and we enjoyed a number of awesome services. We had wanted to schedule mani/pedis, but were informed that those services were no longer being offered. That being said, mani/pedi services remain listed in the hardcopy spa brochure in the notebook on the desk. How hard is it to tape over the listing? The next morning we called to see if complementary coffee was offered (of course this 5-star room has no Keurig) and found out that the coffee set-up in the lobby is dismantled at 7AM, but is available ‘upon request’ at the restaurant. One would think with the mission statement: “to delight our guests each and every day” that someone might have brought some up to our room. We thought we we could provide some feedback at checkout, but we were never asked about our stay. The Front Desk could learn some valuable lessons from hotel chains that charge half their rate. MO NYC was opened in 2003, and it appears that they are way past due for some refresher training about the meaning of providing the very best in luxury hospitality.","Gaithersburg, Maryland","cherirosenbradley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gaithersburg, Maryland</strong>",28,3.0

Based on prior reviews, I asked about the price of WiFi, and the desk person comped it (gave it to us free) immediately and without discussion. View is fabulous, as noted. Unasked, they gave us the Central Park view, which surprised but pleased me. We liked the connection to the mall, especially since it was super cold outside. Perhaps feeling the need for a plebeian experience after the breathtaking cost of the hotel, we had breakfast at the Whole Foods in the basement of the mall - served the need perfectly. Pool was out of order during our stay due to frozen pipes. We were disappointed with that, but these things happen. Steam room and hot tub were both comfortably warm at around 100 degrees F, but another degree or two warmer would have been better. Turning on the TV set as part of the evening turn-down service is a bad idea.

There is a Whole Foods Restaurant and we enjoyed purchasing snacks, fresh juices, and eating from their buffet.Our room was on the 53rd floor--a Hudson River view room. The room was well designed with spectacular views of the City and New York Skyline. Good views of the Hudson--partially obstructed by other buildings.It came with a $ 75.00 per day meal or Spa allowance.WiFi was included.The bathroom was wonderful! Large with double sinks, a deep tub with views overlooking the City and Hudson River, and a TV, and a large and separate shower. The King size bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the magnificent views and sunsets from the room and the bed.Cleaning could have been better--the room was not automatically vacuumed daily. We had to request it along with a change of linens daily. Housekeeping aims to please and we found Housekeeping will honor requests about cleaning the room, extra pillows, towels, and toiletries, etc. Room service was excellent--a broader menu would enhance it. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel. Elected to try nearby restaurants and really enjoyed Jean Jorges at nearby Trump Tower.Had a terrific and relaxing massage at the Spa.

Wife and I do that 4-5 times a year since our little one showed up. Nothing like a 24h break in a hotel with a pool and spa -assuming the facilities are really nice.Sadly, our high expectations were not fully met at the Mandarin. Surprising since I am usually a fan of Asian five star chains or hotels, and stayed at many Mandarin which always gave me full satisfaction.Arrival:Lobby elegantly decorated but setup in such a way that you feel like you just stepped into Grand Central Station at rush hour. Very busy every time we went through it (granted it was during the xmas-New year period so one can expect lots of tourists.) But the issue is the long line of people waiting to have access to the tea salon or adjacent lobby bar. And if you feel that because you’re a guest paying close to $1,000 a night you will have some kind of priority when you decide to spend an hour there and soak up the beautiful views over Central Park and Columbus Circle, well think again.The front desk agent checking you in will waste no time telling you that the hotel has outsourced the management of those two spaces to some obscure Chicago-based company and that should you want to get in, you will have to book a reservation via the concierge. Am I still talking about the only places for drinks in the lobby area? Yes I am.Room:We booked a standard room via Amex Plat and we didn’t have an upgrade. Again, no big deal since busy season and we were not really expecting one. After seeing the first room (4818), we asked for another, that would have less of a weird layout. That room was actually accessible, which explains the unusual layout. We were moved to 5332, which while much smaller, was a bit more Mandarin style. Great views from the high floor.Small-ish bathroom, with only one vanity. And I just don’t get this. 5 Stars hôtel in a very modern building and they couldn’t design the room with a double vanity bathroom? Strange. Not a deal breaker but strange. Room was elegant in the Mandarin-asian zen traditional style. But I couldn’t put my finger on what made the overall experience disappointing. I just kept having the feeling that the room/furniture/hallway/wall paint etc...were tired.The property is definitely ripe for a renovation when you consider other similarly priced properties such as the Baccarat, the Peninsula, Four Seasons Downtown and many more.In-room Dining:Ordered dinner before our show at the Dizzy’s jazz club in the same building. One of the dishes, a market salad, had a very fishy taste that both wife and I had a strong reaction about. We didn’t touch it past one bite. Looked at the menu to make sure and no, no fish ingredients listed. Called to indicate the issue. Got some very polite apologies but the dish was not removed from the bill by the time we checked out. I didn’t say anything because its not very elegant but still...Spa:Over Asia and other countries, the spa at Mandarin properties have very high reputations so our expectations were high. My massage with Nicolette was excellent but the overall experience was a bit of a letdown. Firstly, the entrance is on the 35th floor, right next to Grand Central mentioned earlier and we debated before heading down whether we should don our plushed bathrobes or get dressed. We opted for jeans. Who walks in Grand Central in a robe? Once in the spa, everyone is very polite and kind. But there again, not sure why, the setup didn’t scream exclusive and elegant spa. Was it the floor to ceiling windows that made the atmosphere cold? The lighting? Anyway, we didn’t feel like we were in a 5 Stars spa in the middle of one of the most expensive cities in the world. Again, this is my subjective opinion.Pool:It’s located one flight above the spa and there is conveniently an elevator to bring you there from the spa, without having to go trough Grand Central. But then again, you’re in for a scary experience. This elevator is brutal. You know the kind that you don’t know when it leaves and you’re already there? Well, that’s not one of those. It’s more like a version of riding an elevator in SF in the middle of the BIg One. Everything shakes when you depart and when you arrive, and the trip takes an hour. The pool is a nice size (for NY standards)and the water had a good temperature. What was bizarre is that even though we came from the spa elevator, we were asked to sign in. Why I wonder? All guests from the spa have access to the pool so I missed the point. It just didn’t feel like you were in a Mandarin... Also, there were 3 persons at the desk who were busy tasting chocolates (from Maison du Chocolat, my favorite so I can’t blame them) but once we got to the pool which was empty, we noticed dirty towels on every single bed. None of the desk persons followed us in the pool area and there was only one clean towel on the shelf so I had to go back in and ask for one. Got one, and then we proceded to remove the used towels from a bed so we could put our belongings. Again, not the top notch service I came to expect from properties like the Mandarin.Fitness:Located next to the pool area. I decided to check it out after the pool but since I had left my sneakers at the spa reception, i was in for another dreaded elevator ride to get them and use it again to go back. Fitness equipment is excellent, new, and in great working condition. Odd thing was I couldn’t find any towels. No shelves. I saw the basket where you can dispose of the used towel but I’m still perplexed about the missing towels. Was the shelf right there, staring at me and I missed it? Who knows. The point is, towels ina fitness room should be the first thing that your hand encounters.... you should not go on an expedition trying to find one...Conclusion:Business in NY is tough. Competition is strong and one has to keep up with standards being raised every day. I get it. And that’s why my review here is a bit severe. I tried many competing properties and the way I see it, in the current state this hotel is in, there are no reasons why we should plan another staycation at the Mandarin. Just too many missed opportunities to leave a lasting impression on guests who are familiar with the brand.","New York City, New York","jeffNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,3.0

However, I was in town for just one night to attend a special event at Per Se, and the experience was not as up to par.The room was clean and neat, and the view was spectacular. However we were woken up at 5:30 AM with a wake up call. This would have been fine, if we actually PLACED a wake up call request, which we had not. We were planning on sleeping in that morning but it was not meant to be. I almost slept through it but they kept calling over and over again!!!Possibly an honest mistake (albeit a rookie one), but the thing that bothered me about it was the reaction by the staff member when I checked out. She said ""sorry,"" but that was it. And then as she finished checking me out, she laughed and said ""next time, we won't wake you up at 5:00 AM!""TBH, I might have given this hotel 5 stars, but the attitude and discourteous nature of the woman whom I checked out with, just ruined it.

However, I certainly can’t pass without noticing certainly uncomfortable issues: The place is popular; restaurant and bar are busy serving the external guests. So, it was the first place in the world where I couldn’t have a lobby bar drink at 9 pm. “Fully booked, sir! Really sorry...”. When I came down at 11 pm, the bar had shut down already. So, too busy, too crowded, and the hotel guests can feel there at the party, but not at home.The premier Central Park view room is not spacious enough and comfortable for two; compared to the same class hotels you get less vacant space and no convenient working zone.

One restaurant, one small bar and a lounge area that are ""full"" the whole time with empty seats marked ""reserved"". They are playing the stupid game of showing these facilities as being in demand, but for a hotel guest with limited choice for a quick snack or drink you have to suffer this nonsense. Ridiculous, they are clearly targeting the local NYC market at the expense of hotel guests for their public spaces. Also having to take two elevators to get to your room from the lobby is an added annoyance. Staff are helpful and polite but that is the only positive.

Initial impressions were very good, we had a lovely high room overlooking the river (high up is good if you want to escape the noise and obviously have a great view), the room was clean and had all the facilities and was a good size, although it was a little tired and needed a bit of updating. Bed was very comfortable. Staff were very attentive. The restaurant Asiate was great for breakfast, lots of choice and good service. (but please don't refill my teacup, I am British and I like to pour it myself. I had to guard the teapot!) The reception and concierge were incredibly helpful, as were the doormen. There were a couple of niggles. One afternoon we wanted to sit and have a drink in the Aviary but we weren't allowed to sit by the window as those seats were reserved for 'larger' parties. However the place was empty, but they 'helpfully' said they wouldn't seat anyone by the window directly in front of our allotted table so as not to spoil our view. So why could we not sit by the window then? It remained free for the entirety of our refreshment. My husband and I felt it was a silly rule when the bar was very quiet. We went to the spa where we both had a fantastic massage. The only thing that let the side down a little was the pool reception staff were a little unprofessional, they were swearing and mucking about which didn't necessarily bother me, but it might have bothered some guests. We went to Asiate one evening and had their tasting menu with the wine. The food was good, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting for the price. I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu and would choose differently if I went again. I didn't feel we had value for money with the wine either. It all felt a bit rushed. However they were accommodating with a menu change for my husband. It just lacked a bit of 'occasion'. Having read this back, it sounds a bit harsh, generally speaking we had a great time, just a couple of things that let the side down but certainly didn't alter the fact that we had an incredible time. I would certainly recommend the hotel, but with hindsight I would probably eat out and I would be more insistent about sitting where I wanted in a quiet bar. We had a fantastic experience and New York is a fascinating city.","Hampshire, England","BarbadosBaby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hampshire, England</strong>",25,4.0

The beds are comfy, and bathroom facilities are nice.There was no lounge while I was there, no where to crash after a hard days shopping for afternoon Tea or coffee, before venturing back out into the city for the evenings entertainment. Instead you were expected to sit in the seating in the very cramped, impersonal reception. Not conducive to relaxation. The billing regime is slightly odd to.

We got a decent rate, though still expensive at $750 a night, but splurged while my husband was working in New York. Front desk was lovely and got us into their new speakeasy for a drink and snacks upon arrival. But unknown to us the bar area was being renovated. Room was decent, but a bit dated with paint peeling in places. Concierge was hit or miss. Sometimes they were totally on, but when we needed help on 4th of July, took them 4 hours to get us to their entertainment guru for help finding a fun place to dance and be adults without kids for the night, and by then we had taken care of ourselves and found a cheesy place to have fun. My spa service was lovely, but I have to say the spa was not as great as I thought it would be. Front desk didn't seem thrilled to have us there.

From the views to the spacious and well appointed room we could not have been happier. The hotel amenities covered everything and even though they have some renovations happening at the minute it really didn't have any impact on our stay. The people who work at the hotel are gorgeous, they cannot do enough for you and make you feel very much at home. Chandra our housekeeper was so lovely and very happy to provide tips on local activities and share her local knowledge and Joel at the concierge performed miracles to organise reservations at some of New Yorks best and Michelin ranked restaurants. The location was ideal for us because even though we do like shopping, we also enjoy going for walks and running so being on Central parks doorstep made our trip very memorable. Thank you so much we had the best trip we could have ever have wished for and the hotel manager who we bumped into without realising he was the manager was very keen to seek our feedback about our trip and stay before he mentioned he was the manager - which is a real sign of his commitment to making sure the hotel is delivering the service and experience his guests desire.

We have stayed in rooms facing either the Hudson River or the Central Park. The view could greatly improved, if the Trump Hotel is shifted about fifty blocks to the left. The hardware of the hotel combines elements of the MO in Las Vegas such as the open lobby, it also has the grand view like the MO in Tokyo and also the massive size of the DC property. Service is where it slides quite a bit in comparison. First visit, the receptionist barely made eye contact. The spa is also a real let down, I have had better massage at the local YMCA for fraction of the price. The spa receptionist was outright rude, and therapist was in a rush and had the touch of a limp fish. The views of the central park from the restaurant is breathtaking, but when the regular F&B manager is not on duty, the food and service can be all over the place. Empty coffee pot left unattended, welcome smoothie not served and seating out of order. One morning, the steak and eggs rubbery and the Japanese breakfast inedible on second try. Most embarrassing was my hosting of a Sunday brunch; we were fortunate enough to be seated in the side room. However service was neglected, drinks barely refilled and food mediocre at best. Upon giving feedback to the substitute manager, we were told ""they were busy."" I still like the MO, it has lovely room and a very generous bathroom. The duty managers go above and beyond and readily rectifies short comings. I just wish the MO service philosophy trickles down stream.

We had just delighted in NYC's own ""Manhattan-henge"" sending startling sunset straight thru the crosstown streets & came home to the hotel to find this new treat. Located on our 35th-floor hotel lobby with other Mandarin Oriental courtesy services, including its fragrant spa & the Asiate Restaurant (which still serves my favorite NYC corporate breakfast with eagle-soaring views), this jewel of a cocktail haven is accessed, with the help of the concierge & a reservation, through a velvet-draped hidden passageway. ""THE OFFICE: NYC"" is all about service. Our hosts, Sebastian & Anthony, tucked us into a comfortable dining nook with rich leather seating & dark wood to enjoy discovering this new bar with the feel of a private speak-easy. Brass antiques abound, with little secrets appurtenances, like a dancing monkey sculpture & a non-functioning antique radio which swivels open to reveal brandy & crystal highballs ready to pour out the fun. Even though a special ""THE OFFICE: NYC -- EXTINCT SPIRITS & ANTIQUITIES"" menu was served, with liquor arranged by historical decade, the approach with our cocktail order was an emphasis on personal interplay with our bartender. Nicholas, quite the drinks-master, scoped out my abiding preference for wine, even over his inventive cocktail suggestions & he graciously provided me with a Château Pressac Saint-Émilion Grand Cru Classé 2007 which was not even on the menu for my drinking pleasure before the Lincoln Center Festival ballet started, performed right there in the hotel building at the Rose Theater. What a prince of a wine this was to taste. First of all, classy fruit presented itself in the nose with the rest of its heady almost-caramel fragrance. And then, on the tongue, a well-rounded smooth​, actually​ rather extravagant​ Bordeaux. Although the non-stem wine-glasses are not to my liking, I admit they are​ ​of late​ stylishly cutting-edge.Lovely ​signature ​etched plates ​& stem-ware are also served with the small plate menu specialties. We enjoyed the Salmon Rillettes dressed with créme fraîche aux fine herbs​ & yellow caviar & buttered buckwheat toast. This was a familiar dish from my grandma's ​table ​& it was even served potted in a ​comfy-looking covered glass dish, with the freshest​-ever​ herbs on top ​& even a few brilliant red flower petals.To finish with something sweet​ before putting on lipstick for the theater, we had blueberry cobbler with creamy sorbet & drooled with honey that tasted like lavender. Next time,​ we want to try​ the​ Prime Rib-eye Tartare, because Nicholas was bragging on the beef ​---​& for me, the special Iberian Ham dish​. The Mandarin Oriental does continue to impress.","New York City, New York","VKMc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",53,5.0

The whole experience was lovely and relaxing. The service was amazing. Our scones, sandwiches and sweets were delicious, not to mention the cream and homemade jam. They presented my daughter with 3 chocolate covered strawberries with a lit candle for a bday treat. We couldn't finish all of the sweets but took them to enjoy later.

I normally stay at the Peninsula, but this time I decided to change it up. During the reservation I was told the suite I booked had a ""full Hudson River and Statute of Liberty View.."" Not even close! At best, we saw small glimpses of the river and the Statute of Liberty was nowhere to be found. The onsite restaurant is basically a Dennys, at which I never eat, but we elected to try their breakfast. I am certainly not a penny pincher, but for $110 (pancakes, eggs, coffee and on orange juice), I thought it may be delicious. Again, not even close! I stayed in suite 4530 at $1995 per night and found it to be dark, damp and musty. The employees are nice and professional, except for the doorman, that guy is useless. The only other good thing I can articulate is the limo service arranged thru the hotel is the best I have experienced. Lastly, the lobby is on the 35th floor and depending on which elevator you use, one must switch elevators at least twice to gain room access. I feel I wasted almost $7000 for three days at this subpar property.","Vacaville, California","Steve M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vacaville, California</strong>",8,2.0

Had business and dined in the Restaurant against the windows and soaked up New York sky line with really attentive waiting staff. Unobtrusive but focused on what was happening on the table with drinks, food plates etc. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous - pillows - feather duvette - amenitites were well selected and fresh. Breakfast after a long walk in central park had some unique different choices which was refreshing - try the Japanese breakfast box - light delicious and fresh. Seating is different level so you all get to capture the views. If you are looking for under stated luxury - quiet elegance and the true brand of Mandarin Oriental in an iconic location with absolutely high stunning views from many windows then you should stay here. Spring is the best time as its warmer - the park is in full bloom and love the energy of all the dogs walking. Joined a fun run on the Saturday which gave you a sense of community right off.

My wife and I, came to NY for a family event and figured it would be a good opportunity to see what this hotel is all about.First things first, 1400 dollars a night for a room, I was expecting the accommodations to be in the same category as the St. Regis. We were escorted to our room, only to realize how cramped and small it was. The view was not particularly great, as we were blocked by tons of buildings and faced the beautifully green looking Hudson River. I thought maybe the bathroom is what people love about this place. I was wrong. While the bathroom is big and luxurious, it is an odd layout with a cheap looking bathtub and toilet. It was very narrow and the doors would not close. The bed was average and had very tough pillows.When I woke up in the morning, I needed a coffee and figured the room service would be just fine. My coffee was watery and tasted like it sat on the fire since 6am. The only great thing was the late check out for 3pm, as this is very uncommon in NYC hotels.I am generally not someone who complains however, for this price I was expecting a little more.

Everything from check in to check out was seemless. The staff are excellent - each and every member of staff we encountered was friendly, knowledgable and happy to help. We stayed in a Hudson View room on the 53rd floor and the views were fabulous. The room was very spacious even by NYC standards as was the amazing bathroom complete with bath, large shower and TV. The level of in room house keeping is very high. I don't know how they manage it but the rooms are cleaned and made up immaculately and yet you never see housekeeping or housekeeping trolleys. I amazed how they do it. The turn down service provided nightly is also excellent as each night you are provided with a letter offering details of the weather forecast for the next day and possible activities for you to consider as well as a quote, or pearl of wisdom about sleep. It's a very nice touch.We used in room dining a couple of times (breakfast and dinner) and the attention to detail is brilliant. They bring a table complete with linens and flowers and set the table as if you were dining in the restaurant. The food was excellent. The only thing that I felt was trying to be too clever and ultimately not working as well as it could was how they operate mini bar services. The mini bar and in room snacks are motion sensitive. Once you pick up and item from its spot you have 30 seconds to put it down or you are charged for it. We had seen this in the in room information which detailed this therefore did not pick anything up however at some point possibly during housekeeping items had been somehow dislodged and these items were now appearing on our bill. This issue was addressed and was a non issue however it seem like a cumbersome feature that is not fool proof.In terms of location I loved this hotel. It is facing Central Park and more or less above the 59th Street Subway so is excellently appointed with all areas of NYC easily accessible from this location.

Checking in was quick and friendly, and the gentleman at the front desk personally brought us to our room. The room overlooked Central Park and Columbus Circle...and since we were on the 53rd floor, we had an amazing view of the city. The decor was elegant, but comfortable and ""home-like,"" with a very comfortable bed and a large flat-screen TV. The bathroom had a shower (with ""normal"" and ""rainfall"" showerheads) and a large tub. There was plenty of closet and drawer space (far more than we needed).The lounge off to the side of the lobby has wonderful views of the city, as well as delicious food, great drinks, and friendly and attentive staff. If you get a couch next to the windows you won't want to leave.We ate breakfast in the restaurant (also on that main lobby floor) and the food was absolutely fantastic. And, of course, the view can't be beat.We spent one morning at the spa...and we could have easily spent the whole day. The staff was friendly, the massages were rejuvenating, the facilities are amazing, and we even saw a celebrity! (Smiles were exchanged, but we were respectful of their privacy.)In terms of location...it's tough to beat the Mandarin: it's right on Columbus Circle, across the street from Central Park, within easy walking distance of Broadway shows (we walked to see a show one night), and if the weather is bad you can spend a few hours walking and shopping in the mall on the first couple of floors of the building. (There are also some fantastic restaurants there.)Every staff member we encountered - from the gentlemen at the front entrance, to the staff in the lounge and restaurant, to the cleaning staff - was exceedingly polite, very friendly and always helpful.I've stayed in a lot of nice hotels in NYC, around the country, and around the world, and this was easily one of the best places I've ever stayed. In fact, we are hoping to make this an annual ""anniversary"" trip.Let's be honest: Is the Mandarin Oriental expensive? Absolutely.Is it worth that expense?

Every person we encountered was kind, friendly, and helpful. --when the hotel learned of our anniversary, they sent up champagne, sweets, and a congratulatory note. --our room was beautiful, the bed was heavenly, the bathroom luxurious, and the Central Park views were spectacular. --the location of the hotel cannot be beat. It's a quick walk or train ride to pretty much anywhere. And Central Park is right there! I also think it's advantageous to have the Time Warner shops sharing the building with the hotel as well. We enjoyed some light shopping and picked up treats from Bouchon Bakery. --we took advantage of the pool and gym. The pool is really beautiful! It was also empty when we used it so we had it all to ourselves. --breakfast at Asiate each morning was a true treat. My husband and I are usually too busy for our own good.

I phoned the hotel prior to our stay and asked for a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to be placed in our room, on arrival, as a special treat and surprise for my husbands fiftieth birthday. It hadn't been done and when I asked them to do it, It was put in our teenage sons room and not our room. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful.

There were so many little things that made a difference between this hotel and those we've stayed in over the past few years. For instance, when our room was cleaned, they folded all of our items that were left out, arranged our shoes and other items, and threw away our trash that was left on the tables. It sounds so small, but even when we've stayed at the JW Marriott, they don't do that. Furthermore, they left bottled water every night at turndown (complimentary), left two complimentary hardback novels to read and take with us, and refreshed our bathroom towels and amenities every day. As dumb as it sounds, one of my biggest pet peeves is having low water pressure or a bad shower head in the shower. This is the first hotel in as long as I can remember that had a great shower head and water pressure! In addition, the room temperature was great, and we were able to make it as cold or as warm as we liked. Finally, the location of this hotel was perfect for us. We did not want to stay in Times Square, as we preferred to stay a little further away from the crowds and noise. The Mandarin is right across the street from Central Park, it is attached to a fabulous mall, and is in walking distance to a ton of different sites and activities. The subway is right at the hotel, and cabs are easily attainable. One final perk is the car service the hotel offers. Although it's not always available, there were two times when we were going somewhere close, and the doorman offered us the complimentary hotel car rather than calling up a cab for us. Just one of the many wonderful services and attention to detail the hotel offers. I highly recommend the Mandarin!",,hotelspoiled,35,5.0

They showed up over an hour later, and the man was extremely rude to my wife and I. He unclogged the toilet, using a disgusting plunger and then used the towels in the room to clean up his mess. When I asked him if that was normal, he wouldn't answer me. He was extremely unpleasant, treating me and my wife like we were a nuisance to him. He then told us he needed help with the ac problem, he called another engineer to the room and that engineer wreaked of cigarette smoke. It was absolutely disgusting, my wife and i had to leave the room because we couldn't take it anymore. When we returned, it still smelled of him. I didn't bother calling the front desk because I didn't want anymore terrible service. We just opened the window.

This was our anniversary gift to ourselves. It is a 5 star hotel and I would give it 6 if I could. Knowing that we were there for our anniversary and booked through the American Express Fine Hotels Program, we were upgraded to a suite. The room, on the 48th floor, was perfect. The first day there we had breakfast in the restaurant. I was very surprised when the waitress called me by my name. That has never happened in any hotel I have ever been to. When the woman who made up our room saw us in the hall, she also greeted us by using my name. And the same thing happened when we had lunch in the lobby cafe. Most impressive!In the afternoon, we both had massages in the Spa. What a treat! A hot whirlpool, a steam room, and a fantastic massage. They also have a relaxation lounge that overlooks the city.The service, the attention to every detail was just perfect.Now, I hate to degenerate into potty talk but I have to. I can only speak for the room I had but I will assume that the other rooms have the same toilet. It is a Japanese toilet. When I walked into the small toilet room inside the very large bathroom, the toilet seat cover rose on its own. When I sat down, the toilet seat was nice and warm. There is a box on the wall that explains how to operate the toilet. It can shoot water up while you are sitting to clean what ever needs cleaning. Now, to be honest, I didn't try that feature.

The accommodations are top notch, the views of Central Park New Jersey the Hudson river all the way up to the George Washington Bridge are breathtaking. The wedding itself at the Mandarin ballroom was one of the best I've ever attended. The catering staff as well as the Mandarin staff handled everything with the upmost professionalism.

We asked in advance, that the suite should be located possibly high level! We got a room on level 38 which is the first or second level with rooms in the hotel which it goes up to 54th level, so not the best view at all and it looks over to a huge terrace of the hotel which is below the room, from the side of the room u cannot see the Hudson river neither. So the hotel stuff just ignored our request which by that price is not acceptable. We asked to change, the staff was very helpful and the promised us a new room in 30 minutes. It took 2 hours!!!!!!!

They called us when our car to the airport had arrived (in advance, which was fine because we were ready) and we all (I was travelling with husband & children) went to the ground floor (the lobby is on the 35th floor and our bedrooms on the 54th). I don't know what happened then, because the staff spent at least 15 mins looking for our car. It was a complete mess, I think that the team downstairs changed shift, and the new guy didn't have a clue, he first told us that the car hadn't arrived, then that it was the wrong time, made us say our name at least 10 times and ran like a headless chicken to the 5 cars waiting for clients without being able to find ours.Eventually he found the right car (right in front of the entrance) and apologised profusely. I found the whole episode surreal.In short, I enjoyed my stay but didn't feel like a valued customer -more like a walking purse, actually.","London, United Kingdom","MumuGB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",15,4.0

The hotel is perfectly located at Columbus Circle near Central Park, Park Lane and Broad Way with 5th Avenue in walking distance. It is located on the upper floors (36th+) of the Timer Warner Buildings with great views, especially of the Central Park from the top-end bar area on the reception level. The Mandarin staff is authentically friendly, very attentive and helpful. The rooms are decently furnished and decorated with the highest sleeping comfort I have experienced in a hotel. The food either at the bar, for break first or at the restaurant is far-above average. Try the Wonton Soup and the lemonade at the bar! The hotel is a perfect starting point for exploring New York by walking. Just around the corner the Broadway starts, the shows and theaters are in walking distance to the hotel. Walking along Park Lane passing by the other top-end New York hotels (though none of them surpasses the quality and standards of the Mandarin) you will reach 5th Avenue after a few minutes. Left-hand side, you pass by the Central Park and can jump on a Riksha to explore New York's green lung. I have stayed at other Mandarin hotels before in Washington D.C., London, Munich, Singapore etc. and it is the right place to be. The staff makes you feel at home, every service is of the highest possible quality. The concierges are the best travel consulting firms you can experience. So whenever going to New York, there is definitely no better place to stay and to enjoy a perfect hotel service. It is one of the best managed places I have ever experienced!","Hamburg, Germany","wickie64</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamburg, Germany</strong>",39,5.0

Frankly, having now seen the views from the 50th and 54th floors, there is not much of a difference. So don't obsess about it like I did. Even the view of the Park from their restaurant on the 35th floor looks amazing. A couple of things to be aware of:1) WiFi isn't free, or at least it wasn't when I was there. Granted, it wasn't expensive ($5/day?), but I felt like maybe it should've been free given the price of the room.2) Valet service was $85/day. If you're staying there several days, it's something perhaps to keep in mind. It definitely adds up.That said, I felt like I got good value for my money. It's a hotel that deserves its 5 star rating.

Luxury prices for non luxury accommodations. Ny room was small with no extra table for a room service breakfastAnd it looked like an office with black furniture. Fine for a businessman (which I think this hotel caters to) but not for those who are looking for a luxury hotel on an escape to the city.No reception from anyone on arrival by taxi. There were what looked like bellmen but they were busy talking so I found my way to the elevator after realizing the reception was up on another floor, carting my small bag myself. There was a private party in the bar area which is open to the reception so the noise was deafening and I was told we couldn't use that area until the party was over at 8. This tells me the hotel doesn't cater to its guests first, but rather is concentrating on renting itself out to make more money (as if they don't get enough from its guests at such steep prices)Room service took much longer than it should have. I had to actually call them to find out where it was after 49 minutes and I had only ordered a large bottle of water because they only provided the room with one small bottle. The soaps and lotions in the bathroom are tiny, bring your own and I didn't find the towels luxurious at all. They were rough and thin.I was not impressed and feel the prices are WAY out of line for what you get at this hotel. 3/4 star quality for 5 star cost.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","annb0s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",4,3.0

As a New Yorker, I typically know better than to complain about room size, but at $1000 per night, I would expect more space than this room of just adequate size to fit the bed, with not even enough space for a small table to dine at if one were to order room service. The room was tastefully decorated and the bathroom did feel spacious and well-appointed with fixtures and amenities. The bed sagged a bit in the middle and there was a lot of motion transfer when one person got up, which didn't make for a great night's sleep. There was no coffee maker or way to heat up water for tea which was also an unwelcome surprise.There was turndown service, but whomever did it left an empty bottle and dirty glasses.We were celebrating an anniversary and although the occasion was acknowledged verbally at check-in, we were surprised that there was no token fruit or wine or any acknowledgment of the occasion in the room. As my husband commented, even the hotel hallways had bowls of fruit, and even the very casual place downtown that we went for dinner brought us glasses of champagne! The spa locker room was small, with one hair dryer that multiple women were waiting to use. (though I will say the massage was excellent.) The air of stinginess continued when we arrived back at the hotel from our evening out and there was a bottle of water on one nightstand but not the other. Really? For $1000 we can't each have our own individual bottle of water? These are certainly not the most egregious things to complain about overall, but the main message is that it was not a top notch experience and did not feel like it was worth the high price tag.",New York,"Tabb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",11,3.0

Because of that, I don’t think the high prices are justified (base rooms can be around $1,000, base suites can average $2,500). For those prices, you would expect top notch service, and you just don’t see that any more at MONY, not consistently anyway. The Park Hyatt, which is newer, has better service, more updated rooms (high tech), and is less crowded – though you don’t get the views, but the prices are better and it’s a little closer to 5th Ave. The MONY updated some suites recently, mainly by putting in larger circular couches, which look very nice, but are less practical. Used to be very nice, top notch service, exclusive feel to it the first few years after it opened, but it’s lost some of that cachet. Still nice, just overpriced for what you get – but seems their target market now is the business traveler or those not concerned about getting top service and environment in exchange for top dollar.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","George J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",116,3.0

The location is excellent, close to all the beauty and buzz the Big Apple has to offer. Rooms have a gorgeous interior, stunning views of either Central Park or the Hudson River, and all the amenities you could ever need to make a place your ""home away from home."" The fun thing about the Mandarin Oriental New York is that it's attached to Time Warner Center, meaning you are just an elevator ride away from great shopping at all times. The staff at the hotel are kind, helpful and eager to meet your every need. Food options at the hotel restaurant are delightful, and the hotel bar is always worth a visit to catch up with dear friends or make new connections. On this occasion, we stayed over the Christmas period, which is an especially magical time to be there, with all the gorgeous decorations and special events at the hotel and surrounds. Regardless of when you choose to stay, the Mandarin Oriental New York will make for a memorable stay. It will always be one of our favorite hotels, worldwide.

In my view, this hotel is the most luxurious in NYC. It's in a great location - I could walk to Times Square, opposite to Central Park and about a 20 minute walk to Madison and fifth avenue. My room was what I expected from MO - beautiful decor, clean and perfect views of Central Park. The bathroom was not large but it was still a fairly decent size. I've noticed a reviews have said that they have stayed at more luxurious hotels in NYC - I am curious to know what these - I personally have not come across a more luxurious hotel in the city.In terms of service at the hotel - the doormen, porters, concierge, housekeeping and room service staff provided exceptional service. Front desk/check in staff were not bad or unfriendly by any means but I have had more pleasant/friendlier check in service at other 5 star hotels. My biggest suggestion for improvement is for some of the wait staff at the hotel's lobby lounge. Some of the staff at the lobby lounge were great. However, on at least three occasions during my stay I had to wait a long time for my order to be taken at the lobby lounge - there were instances where staff were standing near the counter but for some reason did not come and take my order - that was quite disappointing and I actually had to call a waiter over for my order to be taken after I waited for so long - not the service you expect from a 5 star hotel.Overall I had a great experience at the hotel and thought it was a beautiful venue.

We had reservations at the Baccarat hotel, however this was after the big snow storm and wanted to have Central Park views.We booked through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts, which usually provides for room upgrades, early check in/check out and other amenities if available.The staff at check in was wonderful.

In short we had a fantastic time. The location is simply epic and even if you need to go further afield you're on top of a major subway stop so it's super easy. By being on top of the Columbus Circle shopping centre too you're close to some great shops and all to a Whole Foods which is really handy if you're feeling like some basic, healthy food - in fact we ate here a couple of nights!The staff were 100% friendly and attentive for our entire stay. Even when I was wide awake at 5am on our first morning and in the pool the minute it opened (6am IIRC) I was greeted politely and professionally. Room service staff, house keeping, concierge and anybody else we encountered were all so friendly.Our room was incredible with great views toward the Hudson. The bed was firm but comfortable (how I'd choose it anyway) and the bathroom very spacious and perfectly equipped. The only one thing we wished there was (and maybe this is a British thing) is the facility to make hot drinks in your room - but it certainly wasn't the end of the world as if you go down to Asiate and ask there you can get a takeaway hot drink for which the hotel makes no charge.And now for my only negative point - the reception area lounge. Unfortunately you never feel like you can just walk in here as a hotel guest, sit down and read a book, or look out the window, or just relax - there always seems to be slight pressure to eat/drink something. This is a shame because it's the only lounge in the hotel so there's nowhere else to go. What also sours the experience is that a coffee is $8 and a Coke is $9 which, quite frankly, is just taking the p***! I know it's the Mandarin. I know it's an expensive hotel and I know this is what happens - but it just feels like I'm having my pants pulled down!This aside it's an incredible hotel and we'd certainly return.

Unfortunately, the stay was a big letdown. The property itself is lovely (nice rooms, nice views, etc). But, I found the service to be quite lacking (far less than what I have experienced at 150 dollar a night Marriotts). What the staff seems to be best at is apologizing. And while I would constantly hear ""I am sorry"", I never had the feeling that anyone really meant it (I have a strong hunch that ""I am sorry"" is just MO NYC's way of telling unhappy guests to stop complaining). What particularly bothers me is when hotel managers respond to a complaint by handing out a business card and saying ""call me next time you stay here."" Nothing about such an offer feels genuine to me (and it certainly does nothing to fix the current stay). Nonetheless, this tactic seems to be a favorite among managers at MO NYC and I now have several manager business cards as souvenirs of this unfortunate experience. And, despite the many offers I received to make future stays better, no one seemed to be able to do anything to help me on this one. The over 2000 dollar a night suite I booked had a broken television (it was eventually fixed but it took too long and the repair person had to be in and out of our room during our dinner). Our 200 dollar room service meal took over an hour to be delivered (despite a promise it would be up ""right away"") and my hamburger was burnt. I found the lobby and elevators to be noisy and crowded (not at all exclusive feeling). And, a very loud alarm was ringing in the wee hours of the morning right outside my room. The alarm kept me wide awake until 4AM (and the night staff could not figure out how to turn it off--- but they sure knew how to apologize). Lots of other things bothered me, but most of all I just found the staff to be rude (yet in a very passive aggressive sort of way). In addition, many of them seemed to be very inexperienced and/or bumbling. I have a feeling this hotel has outlived its glory and is now riding on its name and location. For the money, I believe one can do much better in NYC. I won't be returning. Nonetheless, I have a hunch a manager will be responding to this review saying how sorry he/she is and offering to have me contact him/her on my next visit. To that manger, I say no thanks.

The Mandarin chain of hotels makes its name on effortless service, which was on display during our stay. Attention to detail was very much in effect (my wife even noticed that the fingernails of our front desk hosts were all very well manicured). The furnishings in the room are starting to show some serious age with chips and bumps, which is not unexpected at this point. However, the room is still elegant in an understated style and because the layouts are designed well, the wear has not affected the overall effect.We had afternoon tea at the lobby lounge which was excellent, and the room service Japanese breakfast was surprisingly good, approaching in quality to what we've had before in Tokyo.The only downside was that our shower handle broke off while trying to maneuver it back into place after a shower. Although this wasn't a practical issue due to the presence of a rainshower, the staff were unable to replace it on a Sunday but quickly offered to cover one of the charges on our bill due to the inconvenience.We have been a fan of the Mandarin hotel chain for a while, primarily for their excellent service, and this stay didn't disappoint.

My husband, 16 year old daughter and I went to celebrate her birthday. I picked the hotel for the location; we had plans to go to the ballet (Lincoln Center), Le Bernadin, a taping of The Chew and two Broadway shows. We also planned on touring the American Museum of Natural History and the 9/11 Museum. Everything except the 9/11 Museum was within a mile. Check in was very smooth, our bags were brought up immediately by a very personable bellhop. We had a lovely breakfast daily in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed lunch on our arrival day in the lobby restaurant. The hotel sent up a dessert for our daughter to commemorate the occasion. All great things. But . . . for about $1000 a night (we enjoyed a stay two nights, get the third night free special), I wanted to FEEL more and I can't say that I did. My family is partial to the Four Seasons, service and decor. Maybe it was the Asian decor that we didn't connect with. In some ways, it was just as boring as what we often say about Ritz Carlton decor - you could be in any place and a Ritz is a Ritz and in the same way, a Mandarin just be a Mandarin. The Four Seasons tends to make us feel like we are wherever we are, immersing us in the local experience. So would I stay here again - maybe. The location cannot be beat. But next time we visit NYC, I may venture to the east side of the park and stay at the Four Seasons or even head downtown and try the Langham.

All in all I would rate the hotel highly, we had a lovely room with views of Central Park from the 49th floor. The room was not huge but with the picture windows spanning the entire length and height of the wall overlooking the park made the size of the room less important. The bathroom was a decent size with very nice products, and a separate toilet cubicle which is always a nice feature. As we stayed through Centurion FHR program we had breakfast included which was fabulous by the time we figured out our perfect order of the healthy breakfast to share along with one shared order of Salmon Eggs Benedict which were perfectly cooked. The only two issues I had were one with the restaurant- we ate at Asiate on our second nights there and had the tasting menu which was delicious. However the wait staff were determined with each course to clear my dining companions three plates while I was still eating. On two occasions I was still chewing when they removed my plate as I was the slowest in our party of four. This is very basic fine dining etiquette to my mind.... to not clear any plates from a table until all members of the party have finished the course. Similarly at breakfast, if I am not in a diner, don't pour more coffee into my cup until I have finished the cup I am drinking. Apart from that the food was delicious and the service competent and friendly. The second issue was the lack of turn down service which was not provided on our last night after asking the housekeeper to return once we had gone out. She never did.To be fair, on check out the reception person called the manager who had expressed his interest in addressing the turndown issue when we checked out. He was very charming and appeared interested in addressing both of our issues.How does the MO compare with the Plaza, the Pierre, Four Seasons, The London where we have stayed in the past two years, all on short weekend trips to NYC? Very well and we hope to have a repeat stay in the not too distant future. Only real complaint is that when I tried to buy some of the amazing hand cream they had in the lobby bathrooms, the spa and gift shop were all out of stock.

For years, my husband and I, who live in the West Village, have stayed at a hotel in the city for a night to celebrate his birthday.The hotel itself is obviously beautiful. The bar located in the lobby has one the most breathtaking and unique views in the city, but as impressive as the property is, the service is equally amazing. From the moment I gave the doorman our keys to valet our car (a very unique service for an NYC hotel) I felt pampered and looked after. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and genuinely helpful. (Example: We called for the car at the end of our stay. After hanging up, a gentleman called us back and apologized that he hadn't asked if we needed help with our bags.) The service was pampering without being obtrusive.The suite we stayed in was amazing. Located on a corner of the 42nd floor, we had unbelievable views of the park and the river. The electronic shades kept the light and noise of city out, till we were ready to face our day in the morning. The decor was gorgeous with perfectly placed furniture and televisions to make relaxation and comfort seamless. The bathroom was my favorite room and probably the best one I've ever been in. The full service toilet that heats, cleans and dries was out of this world, as was the amazing rain shower head and tub that overlooks the city.Another huge highlight at the Mandarin Oriental was the room service. I'm always surprised how mediocre the room service can be at many luxury hotels. Well not here. The food was brought quickly, presented beautifully and most important was over the top delicious. We had severally Asian selections for dinner (including the tuna tartare-- which was one the most inventive and tasty interpretations of the dish I've ever experienced) and everything was on point. The meal was expensive--as all room service in NYC hotels is-- but the meal was one of the best I've had in months and definitely on par with the top rated restaurants in the city. Breakfast was equally impressive and delicious.I'd definitely recommend this hotel for a Staycation (for my fellow NYers) as well as for visitors to the city. Is it pricey? Absolutely.

In England afternoon tea comes with a selection of savouries and they are replenished at your request. Your tea is poured for you and frequently replenished.I think the Mandarin Oriental could learn a lot about afternoon tea from some of London's best hotels including The Berkeley, The Savoy and The Connaught.

Upon checking in the lady informed us: they don't have connecting rooms as we requested. Also there will be no upgrade since we already booked the highest room category they offer. When I asked them to move us to the connecting rooms tomorrow once they become available she promised to do so. Needless to say I never heard from her again.The premier central park view we paid 1400 a night for ( per room!) was a view of the Trump Tower. No kidding. You can only see edges of the park. The following day my toddler's favorite toy disapeared from the room. We got it back two days later after multiple phone calls- the toy looked very weird as if it was washed ten times. For some people it's not a big deal but for a 2 y o kid it is a very big deal. She cried for hours.The room service was OK but you expect more for that money- very often they forgot to bring an item or two. Once I found a hair in my omlet. They replaced it after my request and I had to wait 30 min. They still charged for that messed up meal. (!) No chocolate, no coplimentary fruits as they do it in Peninsula or four seasons. The hotel does not provide with 5-star services. It's extremely overpriced for what you get. I could not schedule a spa appointment due to they were completely booked for several days ahead. No one knew our names or greeted us upon seeing. It's not what you expect from a luxury hotel. My husband and I have been regular visitors of Mandarin Las Vegas and I can't even compare these two hotels. In Vegas management personally greets us upon arrival every time, they know our names, our toddler's name, even our nanny's name! When my mother in law passed away, mandarin Las Vegas overheard us talking and sent us flowers the same day. This is the way you do business and keep clients on coming back. We go there 5-6 times a year. We will never stay at any other hotel while in Vegas because we are completely satisfied and happy with services provided every time we stay there. On contrary, management of Mandarin New York don't care of its's clients satisfaction and here is why: When I posted my review back in September, someone from the management team responded asking me to contact them for ""the opportunity to discuss your comments further so we can examine the issues you experienced. We hope that you will reach out to us directly at monyc-executiveoffice@mohg.com""I did contact them on November 13th and NOONE EVER FOLLOWED UP. So I am assuming it was done only for one reason: so the potential clients / readers would think the issues were resolved or at least I got a formal apology. Well: I did not. And I don't really need it any more. I just want to write that review so those who consider that hotel know what to expect.

I requested a coffee maker and was presented - two days later - with a 12 cup conference room sized item. It took up most of the room on the dainty desk. No cream provided. Finally - and this is a big peeve - the internet cost 15 dollars/day on top of the $1185 per night I was already paying. Trust me, Mandarin managers, just round it up to 1200 and don't irritate me!!!","Houston, Texas","BombayLiz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",96,3.0

Occasional breakfasts resting there after difficult business meetings restore me like nothing else in Manhattan. Even entering the spacious lobby with its towering flamingo ""ice"" sculpture lowers my blood pressure. (See photo) While the Asiate Restaurant (See photo) is advertised as a soignée adventure in Asian fusion cuisine, I enjoy it for early business breakfasts, instead. In fact, I’ve never even seen the restaurant illuminated at night. Asiate offers the best fresh-squeezed ruby grapefruit juice, the best pressed coffee, the best fresh mixed berries, and the best selection of pastries in town—all enjoyed while scanning the Upper West Side beauty of Manhattan from soaring eagle height. (See photo)On the weekends, the prie-fixe brunch begins with an amuse bouche of yoghurt smoothie offered to you in a sherry glass. Breakfast is also served--and other goodies--out on the plush couches of the Lobby Lounge. (See Photo) This impressive social space features a continuation of the floor-to-ceiling windows from the restaurant, with chaises pulled into conversation circles for four, and my favorite cozy tête-à-têtes seating, so you are perpendicularly aligned for intimate chat.Yesterday, when I came to the Mandarin Oriental for a birthday party, right across the way from us were several Asian guests, resplendent in sheer cocktail dresses, enjoying High Tea in beautiful individual teapots, with the hotel’s three-tiered tower-platters of sandwiches and pastries. After our own festivities, we walked out past a veiled Arabic honeymoon party.Because our gathering was later in the day than I usually come, I was able to visit the Lobby Mobar (See photo), which by then was open. It is designed in dark wood tones with a bold square-shaped bar thrust into the room space and dynamically aligned at odds with the line of the windows. Mobar also features sherbet-colored specialty cocktails, celebrity caviar & Champagne, and several deliciously intimate small tables for two along the outside walls and up a step, so each couple is tucked into a world of their own.","New York City, New York","VKMc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",53,5.0

The service was amazing. When we arrived everyone in the staff knew that we were going to run the marathon and had prepared a special marathon breakfast deal (since the breakfast restaurant would not be opened early enough on the race day) and a small marathon runner gift bag with things to help you recover after the race, like a special SPA offer and different creams, oils and plasters etc.We stayed in a Central Park View Room at the top floor, which had stunning views over Central Park and all the way east of New York. The room was spacious, with a really nice sofa bed by the window, which we used a lot to enjoy the views while sipping on a glass of wine. The bathroom had a bath tub and a separate rain shower, which was so appreciated to get really soaked in hot water after completing the marathon run.The hotel also has a nice gym and a pool on the 36th floor, with spectacular views. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the pool was not just a normal recreation pool but a full size lap pool. We started every morning doing laps in the pool as the sun rose between the sky scrapers. Magical! The hotel has a really good bar and a fantastic restaurant – Asiate – on 35th floor with (almost needless to say, but yes) stunning views over Central Park. We didn’t visit Asiate this time, but have been there several times before and it is one of the best restaurants in New York.Naturally the hotel is quite expensive with that level of luxury and location, but we really felt that we got good value for money and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something extra for their New York trip (or planning to run the marathon next year - the location so close to the finish line and the attentive service before and after the race is absolutely worth every dime).","Stockholm, Sweden","Bjorkfamily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",27,5.0

What sets the Mandarin Oriental apart from all other hotels in NYC is their SPA. Because the spa is located on the 35th and 36th floor, the spa offers beautiful views of Central Park. The treatment was exceptional as was the relaxation room and the rest of the facilities. This is MUST for those staying at the Mandarin Oriental.Our Central Park View Room was spacious, beautifully appointed, and needless to say, the view of Central Park was stunning (although the Trump Tower does obstruct the view slightly). The bathroom was also quite spacious and even equipped with a small flat screen TV. We loved the rain shower with consistent hot water, a necessity after a cold day of walking! Because we booked with our Amex Platinum Card, wi-fi was free.What sets the Mandarin Oriental apart for other NYC hotels is not only their stunning Central Park views or their five star spa, but also their five star service. We flew in early at 8 am and we were extremely pleased that our room was ready. Reception was warm and pleasant as was all the hotel employees we encountered.

Then when we got to our room the room was tiny and very modestly appointed. No heated floors in the bathroom or anything special. Pretty much should have paid $350 a night for a place like this. What we paid was just robbery. To finish off the experience wifi was extra. So we paid over $1,000 per night for a poorly appointed room and they wanted an additional charge for wifi. What a joke.

Room service meals were good, but not spectacular. Breakfast in Asiate was spectacular - both the food and the ambiance. My only nit is that they should offer some Asian choices. One of the things I enjoy about the Mandarins around the world is their dim sum at breakfast. This was not offered at the Mandarin New York.The real differentiator of the hotel is the views of Central Park, city scape and Hudson River. However, the park views are obstructed by the Trump International Hotel which is unfortunate. Still the view is spectacular. Overall this is a very good hotel, especially if you're looking for a high rise with views in Midtown/Uptown.

The conference that he was attending was at the Mandarin and we received a discount to stay there. The location was outstanding, being very close to Central Park and about a 10-15 minute walk to the Theater district. The hotel itself is at Columbus Circle and attached on the third floor to an acccess to the shops at Columbus Circle. The staff are very accommodating and our room was cleaned twice a day. Although the room was average in size, the bathroom was spacious with a separate toilet area and a large shower stall beside a large bathtub. I really enjoyed the lap swimming pool which is next to the gym on the 36th floor. There are beautiful views of the city in the pool area and the changerooms were clean and well stocked with towels and shampoo, etc. What may be of concern to some is that the checkin desk is on the 35th floor. You have to take one set of elevators to the 35th to checkin and then a second set to your room. So everytime you want to go outside, you must take 2 different elevators. Also there was no clock or coffeemaker in the room which was inconvenient. My husband went across the street to Starbucks for his morning coffee and I found it disconcerting when waking up, not to know the time as we were on a tight schedule. I know that this is easily remedied by looking at your cell phone. I just found it weird that such an expensive hotel would not provide a clock.I thought that the direct access to the shops at columbus circle was ideal. On the Saturday night that we were there, we went to dinner at one of the restaurants at the mall and then to the jazz club, Dizzy's without going outside which was excellent considering that there were torrential downpours all day. Just make sure that you reserve at Dizzy's. It's cheaper to sit at the bar that pay the $45 cover charge at a table. The shops at Columbus Circle also have a Whole Foods on the lower level if you want to make yourself a salad or pick up hot foods without going to a restaurant.

We had stayed there several times before and had a confirmed booking for a Central Park facing suite, to serve us on our business trip.When we arrived we were offered a different suite by the inexperienced receptionist who when I showed him our email confirmation, just left us for nearly half an hour. My wife was unwell and coughing badly but no one took any notice and we stood around waiting. After a long interval a ""manager"" arrived who said that he could place us in a different suite - which was just as good but didn't have the view. We would have had to change rooms during our stay, if we accepted this - which was unacceptable.My wife was clearly unwell but he ignored her and she had to ask his colleague for a glass of water - but no seat was offered. No apology was given, no attempt was made to make us feel comfortable - and the impression was given that it was our fault! We felt that neither the manager nor the receptionist displayed even the most basic of courtesy. We felt that they were unwelcoming, uncaring, unhelpful and tried to be patronising - although they had no basis for such.We had to leave the hotel without other accommodation as a result of this.On the basis of this experience, we are minded never to stay at this establishment again and would not rate it as suitable to accommodate international business people.

I typically choose to stay at the MO when an MO is available in cities around the country/world. We had just been to their Atlanta facility a month ago and found it to exude oriental hospitality and Georgia charm. So we were looking forward to MONY (the last time I stayed there years ago, I raved about it to my mum).What remains extraordinary in MONY:* Hotel personnel with special kudos to Reception, Concierge and Doormen as well as the Asiate (perhaps food/beverage) Manager, sommelir and Asiate maitre d's in the AM and lunchtime of Friday, May 29, Sunday, May 31 and Monday, June 1 (but see below)* Desmond in the Lobby Lounge* Luxurious rooms in a luxurious facility* Amazing vistas and views* Convenient location adjourning Time-Warner CenterWhat is not so MO-like:* Your staff on Sundays seem a little green and unknowledgeable in general* The extremely rude and argumentative maitresse d' manning Lobby Lounge the mornings of Saturday, May 30 and Sunday, May 31. At every MO, we are gifted a tea with skim milk (how much does this cost at cost? pennies) and half a cup of soy milk gratis in the mornings. Indeed in Atlanta, when they saw my mum coming in the morning after we worked out, they automatically went in to get her soy (that's called proactively anticipating, what MO prides itself in). We made the mistake of (instead of going to Asiate who granted the same courtesy on Friday) to approach this rude prig at the Lobby Lounge who was stand-off'sh, ran into the back, only to come out to say no, that'll be $8 in that attitude-filled manner. We explained to her what Asiate granted us just the day before and other MO facilities and asked to see the manager. She scuttled away and returned sullenly to throw tea and soy at us. On Sunday, we made the same mistake of approaching the prig because we thought she had sorted this out the day before. Same thing - so I asked her whether we had to argue with her every morning. She couldn't care less and ran away again. We gave up and went to Asiate where we found the food/beverage manager who said but of course, and profusely apologized. Nonetheless, this outstanding and luxurious experience is just soured by this prig who is poorly trained and rude to boot. She has no place in an organization like MO.* Your prices are too high and your mark up in the restaurant unrealistic (especially given the broad quality of your wait staff in both restaurants really)","Cleveland, Ohio","DNARNA2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",83,4.0

And it is.I would say this hotel is in the best location in New York, its directly opposite the park which looks so beautiful when you pull up in a car outside. Nothing is too much trouble at this hotel.Hotel starts on the 35th floor so great views from reception and the restaurants there. We only had breakfast once at this hotel and didnt venture to any of the other bars (although now wish we had for the view!) but the breakfast was luxurious. Not the cheapest but then you dont expect it to be and the service is great. Little touches like the orange juice and smoothie shot are great. Mum had cereal and toast and I had the healthy breakfast - scrambled eggs and spinach, granola, yogurt and fruit - I thought this was expensive at $37 BUT the portions were huge so would definitely fill you up in fact I couldnt eat it all.We were upgraded from a City view room to a river room view which was beautiful. You can still see buildings but lovely to see the river too. We had a twin bedroom - really comfy beds, and the bathroom is huge - big shower, big bath and even a TV! TV in the main room is HUGE. Only negative on the room would be not enough space for clothes (wardrobe smallish and only 4 drawers but then perhaps people dont stay here long?) and no tea or coffee making facilities - we had to ask for these. We were brought a coffee machine (not one I knew how to use) and a kettle. We then had to call for fresh milk, cups and teabags each day which was a little annoying as my mother who I stayed with loves a cup of tea first thing.Swimming pool a great find especially the views up there. Hotel staff cannot do enough for you. The lady on front desk was so helpful to my mum when she tried to call her bank back in the UK, she connected two calls for her and warned of the charges!Rooms cleaned twice a day. First night we were left chocolates on the bed. Love the quotes they leave on the bed each night too. Fresh water left each night. Shame the wifi isnt free.I would definitely stay at this hotel again as the location is divine. Away from the hustle and bustle of Times Sq and the park is beautiful in spring.Special thanks to Carlos the concierge who made our first subway trip very easy - this meant a lot to my mum who was very nervous about getting the subway. He told us the easiest way to get down to Battery Park.Special thanks to one of the other men (sorry didnt know his name!) who when we checked out and presented us with the bill kindly took one of the phone bills off that my mum had run up calling her bank back home as a gesture of goodwill.When you spend a lot on a hotel you get the best service without a doubt. It also has a shopping mall below which is really classy.

They were always watching ready to jump in and aid on directions, elevator door is now open, assistance. I never had to request guidance. However they all were mechanical following a script. I am tired of service people following canned questions and responses especially at the end “is there anything else I can help you with today”. The rooms were made twice daily and exceptionally well. I just don’t understand why they would charge for internet considering what they charge for rooms and other hotels that charge a third of their rate include internet. It’s not the money just the impression of being nickle and dime’d. The spa was outstanding. Full luxury, professional staff and experienced. Don’t miss the spa!!

But for a Mandarin Oriental, I had hoped to say an extraordinary hotel.Lobby: situated on the 35th floor. Nice, impressive, nice lounge to have snacks and drinks. Service: okay. Be sure to make a reservation, it is very busy here.Restaurant: great! Had breakfast here 7 days in a row! Special thanks to Aneta and Geraldine (from Belgium, like us :-) ), we had a table at the windows 7 days in a row! Great!!! Service: impeccable! Best to make reservations to have a table with a view!!Rooms: okay. Size great, bathroom needs a bit more shelving to store stuff. Rooms look okay, but no ‘wow’-effect (except from the view!! ) concerning the interior design. Great walk-in dressing. (we had room 4802). One can here every word said in the hallway, so for a 5star, I would definitely change all the doors by soundproof ones. There was construction going on in the room next door, so the noise was horrible. But I understand that a hotel needs to improve, so as long as the noise didn’t start before 8.30, I did not feel the need to complain. Pool: well…. this was a bit of a downer for me. A pool on the 36th floor should / could be breathtaking, but the entire area (dressingrooms, shower, small sauna) looked rather basic. If you compare this to the Mandarin in Paris… The pool is in the basement there, but oh dear! Did that look great there!!!! So here, the 36th floor should give a feeling of extraordinary, super-de-luxe, over-the-top, but well… it didn’t. Changing room: only one shower.My overall impression: perfect location, nice views, but some improvements concerning interior design need to make (yeah, for the people who have read my previous reviews, a love a hotel that leaves me breathless, or where I at least get some ideas if I wanna change my home interior again ;-)).We had lunch one day in the Baccarat hotel one day (recently opened), and well: the interior design there left me speechless for at least 5 minutes (which is long for me, LOL). So if the Mandarin wants to belong to the best, they should go and have a look there (what i didn’t like in the Baccarat by the way, was that there is no view when sitting in their lounge. So the Mandarin has a lot more potential).Would I stay here again? Yes. We have met some very nice staff people here (Aneta, Geraldine, the french guy managing the lobby lounge), and their friendliness is something that sticks! And if you are at reception, and you are being served by an extraordinary handsome guy with the most beautiful eyes one has seen, well, that’s Gabriel. His smile, and the view from the 35th floor, they both made my heart go in overdrive.","Antwerp, Belgium","CCLGRS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Antwerp, Belgium</strong>",38,4.0

By the end of my experience, I wondered if I should try out the DC branch when I'm there in April to see if they are just as excellent. Check in: Awful. AMEX botched things and did not reserve me two beds. I was there for the NBA All-Star game with my little sister. The hotel was booked. There were only single beds. At over 1,000 a night I was not happy. The bellman twisted my handmade scarf from Buenos Aires in the wheel. This is an accident. I understand that. I am not THAT unreasonable. Fix: A day later we were offered a room with two beds as there was a cancellation. I was surprised they followed up and frankly did not want to leave our room but my sister wanted her own bed. The next morning my scarf which the hotel offered to clean arrived exactly when they said it would at my room freshly dry cleaned. The botch was AMEX and the scarf was an accident. I was a bit grumpy as I had just come from a long flight from LA and my body was in shock from the cold but the staff did not miss a beat and responded with only understanding (I'm sure they wondered if I was some big diva), professionalism, and kindness.Room: First room was Hudson view king bed: Cute view. The room was on the penultimate floor and so no noise issues. The decor is modern traditional. The tv should be updated to a flat screen up against the wall. The furniture is dated but tasteful and appeals to the more traditional. The room is well stocked with Fiji water which is given in abundance throughout the stay. I like this a lot because I feel hotels at this price level should not skimp on bottled water which many do. The internet was free but I don't know if that is because of AMEX or everyone gets free wifi. I hope everyone does. It wasn't the strongest connection but not the worst. The bathroom was large double sink for this room. Single sink for the room with two beds that we moved to later. The bathroom was stocked with toothbrush, shaving items, red envelope bath salts (I asked housekeeping for extra and took them home. Yes, I am that person. I also took a pair of slippers). There is a nail kit and complimentary shoe shining. I used the shoe shining service and thought they did a decent job. Housekeeping is very good. In the 2 bed room, I noticed dust around the edges of the wall. Sorry, I look at detail. The 2 bed room was on a different floor. Overall, I loved the larger room and thought the smaller room was adequate. The turn down service was twice a day and a newspaper was delivered daily. I rarely made it home before the morning paper delivery. What happens in New York, stays in New York. haha. I noticed the second room was noisier and the view as not as nice but this was the room my sister requested. Lobby: Friendly staff that seemed to care in a way that appeared genuine and not fake. Bell service: Extremely friendly staff. I talked to many of them.Room service: Extremely friendly staff. Notice, attitude goes a long way for me. First floor security as you are leaving: Not as friendly until they realized I was a guest. I don't like that kind of behavior. At an establishment like this, everyone guests and non guests should be treated the same with the exception of reservations of course. LolLobby restaurant: My sister didn't want to go out V day night. She went to bed and I had a glass of wine alone sitting next to Queen Latifah. The restaurant lobby remembers you and even called me doctor (I'm a physician). I didn't need that but it was cool that somehow they knew. I didn't tell them. They knew my last name. The head guy would come talk to me and joke around even though they were swamped. Apparently, I am considered a low maintenance guest. Most people would consider me....particular. This speaks I think more to the clientele that the Mandarin hosts and their commitment to providing the best service to all guests. I thought the food was OK. My sister loved her burger. I had some salmon dish that was new with egg on it that I didn't think was the best. I didn't find it to be a great value but I loved the fact that as a guest I was always seated even without a reservation and near the window. I also liked the ambiance and I found the drinks to be good. I wish they served Justin Cab. It might be low brow for some of you snobs but I like it and I think it's good to have a decent but not overly priced wine on the by the glass menu. I can't knock the lounge down because I loved the staff and ambiance. Main restaurant: The restaurant Asai also remembered me daily. They set me at a table both times overlooking the skyline. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was delicious. The staff was excellent. Sometimes the kitchen was a bit slow but I was having a leisurely time so I did not mind. I would recommend if you are having a power breakfast letting them know your time constraints. They seemed to be used to accommodating particular people. Don't worry, I didn't do anything drastic but I overheard other patrons and the staff did not miss a beat. Breakfast was free for me due to my AMEX but I thought it was a good value even if it weren't. Bar: I didn't go to it. I kept wanting to be in the lobby. Business center: This is the best business center I have ever seen. I went at night and it was quiet and free printing. I didn't really use it but I love anything free. During the day, I went and the lady said oh its 30 minutes complimentary. I recommend going at night I guess. That seems a bit silly at this price point but there is someone in the center during the day to help you fax or whatever. There is a private room you can rent out for meetings. I think this should be free. They have prices for paper and so forth but again I didn't pay for anything so wondering if that's enforced. Overall excellent and a true business center unlike at many hotels were it is an after thought off the lobby. Gym: Small but adequate. Nice water. Gets crowded.Pool: Serene environment. I wish the water were a tad warmer. I couldn't tell but I think it was chlorine. I prefer salt water pools. Gym/Pool changing room: As good as any changing room at a luxury spa. Was pleasantly surprised by this and there is a sauna as well. Spa: Sadly, this was the low point for me. I had a massage at over 200 bucks. The therapist was late, spent a lot of time prepping and closing i.e. not massaging me yet charged me for the 50 min or 60 min that it was scheduled for. I couldn't believe it. She also was not as pleasant as the rest of the hotel staff had been. I told you I'm all about attitude. I love spas and tried this one but next time would see how the Peninsula's experience is. The spa amenities shampoos etc were all adequate. There was a small pool with a massage chair that Ive seen at the Four Seasons in Geneva which sadly I did not have time to use. I pretty much had my massage, was disgusted and left. I will leave this same review on trip advisor for the spa alone but wanted to leave it here so those looking at the hotel know. I should state that if you aren't used to going to spas you will probably think the experience is wonderful. For those who enjoy trying spas throughout the world I would give this one a B -. Surroundings:Central Park, Whole Foods, Mall with expensive items, Restaurants, Arts nearby. Not in the middle of Times Square but enough going on in the neighborhood. Of course, I loved just being at the hotel. Check out: Let's just say I left my wallet somewhere (uber) and had no id or money to get back to LA. The Mandarin booked me a car (yes they charged me 200 bucks), called the airline and got me to the airport quickly. They printed out my folio and I presented this and some mail that I had on me to TSA and after being patted down and probed I was allowed on. I am also TSA pre-check so that probably helped. Disaster and I'm still waiting for my wallet from uber but that's another story. The point was that the Mandarin went above and beyond when I was in a bind. The head manager and his team are truly excellent. If you have stayed at the one in London, I think the service is better at this one but that may be a cultural difference. The decor is entirely different and it appears each one is unique to the local environment. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to wow someone, treat yourself or a loved one, or have a company pay for your business trip. This is a great place for all types of travelers. I think it is expensive but worth the price point.","Los Angeles, California","otheroulli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",87,5.0

I felt that would not have happened without the hotel concierge. Staff is fabulous, except for some here and there, but as I said, much better than other luxury hotels. One caveat most people might not realize -- its location connected to Time Warner building is such that through a separate, 3rd floor entrance, one can access a large shopping mall that has Whole Foods on the basement floor and a fabulous coffee/pastry shop on the 3rd floor. That makes it very convenient to ""get stuff"" and not wanting to deal w/ restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, its location is within a couple of blocks of two Michelin-3 star restaurants and a 2-star restaurant, and the concierge will likely help you get those reservations if you discuss w/ them in advance after you book the hotel. There is even a complimentary car service to the theaters if you plan in advance. In the winter in freezing cold evenings, these were fantastic amenities in NYC.

The service is top notch and this hotel really boasts the most beautiful views of New York and Central Park! Would definitely book a park view room and a table at Asiate (fine dining restaurant) before you arrive, as they go fast especially for dinner. The concierge service is world class, getting you anything and everything you need. Year before last, I asked them for Shake Shack burgers to be set up in my room post-marathon and they sent a runner especially to the upper west side store to grab the burgers. They were still hot when we arrived!Proximity to the finish line : The Mandarion Oriental one of the closes hotels to the finish line. Making the painful journey home post-marathon, just slightly tolerable. The cab ride to the departure buses by the public library on 5th is also just 5-10 minutes. Also if not for the marathon, its just 10 minutes taxi to the majority of the interesting places (Times Square, 5th Ave, Grand Central) and 15-20 minutes to more hipster places in Little Italy, China Town, Lower East, Soho, Tribeca... Services : As I mentioned the concierge is excellent. Also service at the bars/restaurants is worthy of praise. Hotel guests have priority seating in their lobby lounge, which can become quite the tourist attraction on weekends. The hotel thoughtfully privides every marathoner guest with a goody bag filled with energy gels, bars, drinks, bananas, balms and a t-shirt. There is also a table stocked full of energy drinks and fruits the morning-of.Restaurants : Asiate! Oh Asiate, what can I say except that I love you ? (cf. Asiate review... )Spa : I don't recall getting a spa treatment myself but friends have said that it is very, very nice with hammam and sauna facilities. The pool is beautiful and located on a high floor, separate from the spa (which is lobby level).","Hong Kong, China","Jinxy_202</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",32,5.0

I have stayed here many times over the years. It has long been my favorite hotel in NYC. Fantastic location. Exceptional design. I particularly love the suites. Staff is wonderful. Unfortunately, my latest stay was marred somewhat by a bar mitzvah in the lobby & lobby lounge. Luxury isn't returning to your hotel after a long day in the city and walking into someone else's party. I realize some people are just too important to use a hotel's dedicated party facilities, but this really is a show of contempt toward the regular guests. A top hotel should not allow it. If this was just a one-time occurrence, I could overlook it, but on another stay the hotel hosted a dignitary whose security over-ran the lobby. There were goons with ear pieces everywhere. Guests were forced to show room keys before they could use the elevators. It was like being at the airport.

The staff are very friendly and even though my friend and I only had a small roller board each, the doorman insisted on escorting us up to the check-in desk/lobby on the 30th-something floor and then to our room. Front desk staff were very accommodating and from the lobby there is a great view over Columbus Circle and to Central Park south. Our room was on the 50th-something floor looking south. Could see part of the Hudson River as well. The room was nice with 2 beds (as we'd requested) and was in good condition but certainly didn't have the WOW factor that I thought might have come with a $977 price tag. The bathroom was a good size with separate tub and shower and enclosed WC but the lighting wasn't great at the mirror I thought. There was a TV in the bathroom mounted to the wall but neither of us could figure out how to turn it on. We didn't eat at the Mandarin (why eat in the hotel when Manhattan is at your doorstep?) so went to our fav Italian place across from Carnegie Hall called Trattoria Dell'Arte (you HAVE to have the thin crust pizza here - see pic below)!We stopped into the hotel lobby bar for a nightcap when we got back. Service was okay but drinks are as expensive as you'd imagine. Bar and lounge were packed and you can't get a table near the window unless you reserve it. Bar snacks were good.Overall a nice property but for the amount of time you spend in your room in NYC, I'd stay elsewhere/cheaper next time.Oh PS - you are offered complimentary tea in the Spa (if you'd like) after check-in.

Plaza Athene, The Surrey, or midtown at the St. Regis. i have not stayed in Columbus Circle. This being said I am used to the size of the room being larger for the price you pay. Which my price for the weekend was $1,300 per night. It was a lovely room but for the price you get 1 sink.. not my favorite part. and a nicer than average room on a higher floor. So, you are paying for the view… which I will say is amazing. Trump does block a bit though. The service of the staff is well done. It's a Mandarin and New York, so they have to bring their ""A"" game. Enjoyed the bar and having a cocktail with incredible views as well. Did not have the opportunity to eat at the restaurant. They did bring a beautiful green tea when I arrived to my room, that was a lovely touch. Other Mandarins give you a tea at check in. I really enjoyed my hot tea in my room taking in the view.I was not impressed with the size of the room for the price I payed per night. Not having double sinks, if I had a double sink I would have lost space in the room. I asked. The next size suite would have been $4k a night, so no in between in the rooms. It's a little better than average size in the rooms for the higher price per night or a big jump in price for the good sized room with double sinks and view.

Fortunately, my package deal meant we were entitled to a free upgrade to a Hudson River View Room, on the 48th floor, and this was confirmed hassle-free with the hotel a couple of months before departure. I happened to mention at the time that we were celebrating my partner's 40th birthday, mainly because I wanted to find out the cost of having champagne left in the room on arrival. On learning that it would be $177, I politely lost interest. However, August came and some gifts were left in the room which really made the occasion special. It impressed me because the hotel was by no means obliged to do anything, but it eloquently demonstrated the personal level of service the hotel can provide.The bedroom itself commanded fine views of the Hudson River and the immediate vicinity of the city (mainly domestic tower blocks) and, to our delight, we even spied a pint-sized Statue of Liberty in the far distance. The room was a generous size, as was the bathroom, which boasted a bath as well as a shower (three in fact: a hand-held one and a ceiling one, plus another hand-held one by the bath to rinse off the suds), plus two washbasins and, obviously, a toilet, which had a temperamental flush. Everything was clean and tidy, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning whispered rather than growled. In fact we had a very quiet time there, with only the occasional sound of guests' voices outside in the corridor.We chose not to eat any meals there, preferring the cheaper option of the smart shopping mall, of which the hotel is a part and which has a number of eateries and places where you can buy food to take away (the Whole Foods Market on the basement is a gem). We had one drink in the Mandarin Oriental's lounge, simply because it has an amazing view over Central Park and Columbus Circle, but at around $25 a drink we couldn't afford to make a night of it there.Location-wise, it's perfect for exploring Central Park, a gentle stroll away, but the subway station within spitting distance means the rest of the city is within easy reach too.A perfect hotel then? Well, no...not quite. Two things irked me, hence my overall score. Firstly, the hotel charges a staggering $50 corkage fee for any alcohol you bring onto the premises to consume. Secondly, there is an extra cost for WiFi access in bedrooms. I have stayed at a number of cheaper hotels which offer WiFi free of charge, and having paid a not-inconsiderable sum to stay at an upmarket hotel, it felt like the hotel was purely money-grabbing and I admit this left a bitter taste.Even so, I found it hard to fault much of the rest of what we experienced there.","London, United Kingdom","tayn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,4.0

We had both a tub and a shower and a private toilet which is also not the norm in NYC. The bedding was great, the desk convenient and the only drawback was a TV that was wonky at times (frozen and garbled pictures) that the staff blamed on the cable provider. And the staff were very friendly, very helpful and tried very hard to make this a comfortable stay. Overall, a very good experience.

We had arrived early and did not expect a room, but the reservationist said our room was being made up took our phone number and said she would call when it was available. We came back hours later, after three o'clock check-in, and found our room was still not made up (???) She assigned us a different room, and although that solved the problem I was put off by the disingenuous assurances that she first gave us. In addition,I found two small shortcomings, neither of which the hotel can rectify:First, the Central Park view is an oblique view of the Park. Not a head on 12 o'clock view that one would get from the Plaza or the Pierre which are situated closer to the Park. Our room was on one of the uppermost floors and the view we had was about at 8 o'clock on the dial. Again, not the hotel's fault, but do not anticipate anything more.Second, even as a guest it is very difficult to get restaurant reservations. I know that reservations should be made well ahead, but a month ahead it is difficult to decide at what hour you will be able to round up all parties to dine. As a result, we never had to go to the Plaza for lunch and sadly experience the decline of the Palm Court. Again with the restaurant being open to the general public and even with the hotel's policy of reserving the better window tables for guests, it is difficult to dine in house leading to a degree of estrangement. Hint: If you want a quick sandwich and do not want to leave the building, try the food court or one of the (non-hotel, but very noisy) restaurants on the third floor.","NC, USA","OldAntique</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NC, USA</strong>",44,4.0

Concierge was also a great asset of the hotel and we were given very professional and invaluable advise about restaurants and activities in the city.

Sunday brunch at Asiate was a delight and staff honored our request of a table by the window overlooking the park.It was a cold and snowy weekend and we enjoyed the direct access to the Time Warner building mall for shopping and walking by.Only improvement that I can think of is the MO Bar which we found hard to get to and closed quite early at night.

But the lobby bar&restaurant is not so good-we did not like the food at all.Unfortunately, I had a terrible accident at the bath, that was slippery-I've fallen down, bruising my leg, arm and breaking my teeth. That's where the staff were not as helpful as they could've been in such a hotel. The only help we received was a pack of ice and an address of emergency dental service which turned out to be a place where students do their practice exercises. They also offered ""a call to a doctor"" (he called in 1 hour since we asked), as the doctor visit would be 350$. I did suggest that they should do something about the bath as indeed it is very dangerous without the special coating. I've spent several thousand dollars on fixing my teeth and buying medications for my leg & arm - very high price for the absence of the non-slippery coating or a rug.

We were there at the end of March and for 4 days in June. We always like it and bumping into a celebrity is quite common. This time it was Morgan Freeman who was very chatty and explained a bandaged hand was the result of a car incident (not that he was driving). The hotel reception, concierge and valet staff are always efficient but sadly the housekeeping and in room dining is starting to slip. When you pay these prices you expect everything to be perfect. For some reason their Reading Program which we love, missed our room everyday??? Did not get a reason. The best pillows in the world have been changed, I was told that they are testing new products and our input will help them decide, why change when it was perfect.The in room dining service forgot our complimentary smoothies completely the first day, then only 1 the second, on the third no butter and by the time they did, the toast was cold. Not major problems but as I said earlier if you stay at this level it has to perfect.The major issue though this time concerned the cost of international calls, I had forgot my charger and before I bought a new one I used the house phone, big mistake, don't do it. One call was over $100, I complained bitterly and they did take off 25% all the call charges but this still left a sour taste.They said that the phone company operator charges those rates and they don't make any profit from it, I don't believe it for one minute.Please note they do however respond to complaints very efficiently.So if you like hard pillows, don't order room service and never make calls on house phone and can afford to pay the rates and enjoy a bit celebrity spotting, then this is still the best hotel in New York even though it is looking just a wee (we are Scottish) bit tired.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Bert D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",68,4.0

He looked at him and didn’t understand what he was asking for, once he pointed to his head and he saw he was wet he put two and two together. Finally, he was able to get ready but a major inconvenience.After that comedy of errors and seeing random empty Red Bull cans around the lobby, the day we checked out we tried to get into the Lobby Lounge to have a bottle of wine and relax and enjoy the view (keep in mind --it's the 35th floor overlooking Central Park!). We were greeted with a not so polite hostess and told all seats were reserved. After a few minutes, we stated that we were guests and she changed her tune. After spending $1000 at the SPA, hotel room, and food we were checking out with a very bad taste in our mouth. My partner mentioned our experience to the gentleman that checked us out and he brought an assistant manager over who offered us a triple upgrade on our next visit. We left feeling comforted that good service may have lapses but they do redeem themselves...Fast forward several months -- we sent the assistant manager an e-mail on May 20th about our intentions to stay at the Mandarin again and did not hear back. My partner then called a week later and he stated that he would put us in a central park suite and to book a regular room . When my partner phoned the assistant manager stated that we were staying in the same room we were in prior. We had just booked 3 reservations for the SPA ($1000+) as we are meeting a friend from out of state and thought a spa treatment would be nice. What we are most disappointed with is the e-mail that we received last night, stating that was all they were willing to do. In a High Service Industry like yours - the Mandarin leaves us with a tarnished image and the word ""service"" is more like lip.",,Eric A,26,3.0

I booked a standard Cityview Room, but upon checking in I notified the front desk supervisor of the special occasion and she upgraded my parents to one of the best non-suite hotel rooms available – a Premier Central Park View Room on the highest floor of the hotel (floor 54). The room was beautifully and tastefully appointed with amazing floor to ceiling windows overlooking Central Park. Yes, the Trump Building still blocks a good portion of the view of the park, but even so, the view is breathtaking. The front desk took good care of my parents and we had early check-in and late checkout (as a result of booking through Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts program), but that being said there were a few service hiccups that prevent me from giving this a perfect review:(1) None of the guys working outside at the entry of the hotel or in the first floor reception desk near the elevators bothered to help my folks with luggage to bring it up to the 35th floor lobby for check in and no one offered to help us take our luggage down from the lobby to the ground floor and into a cab when we checked out. That’s unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. It could have been because we weren’t stepping out of or into a shiny new Benz or Bentley. The guys downstairs never seemed to ignore those folks…(2) One morning the elevators that take guests from the 1st floor up to the lobby on the 35th floor stopped working. I was the only guest downstairs on the 1st floor waiting for an elevator. After about 5 minutes, I asked the guys at the desk near the doors if the elevators were working and they replied with a flippant “yes”, despite being clearly aware that I had already been waiting for 5 minutes so something must have been wrong. An elevator eventually does open its doors and I step inside and push 35 --- but nothing happens. I wait another couple minutes and when nothing happens, I go back to the front desk and tell them that clearly, the elevators are not working. They leave me standing in the 1st floor lobby for about 10 more minutes as they then scramble to figure out what to do. FINALLY after the 10 minute wait, they tell me the elevators aren't working and escort me to the service elevator – even though I had asked before having to wait 10 minutes whether there was an alternative elevator I could use and they replied that there wasn’t. They should've offered use of the service elevator well before I waited a full 15 minutes.(3) Although the service at Lobby Lounge and Asiate is refined, polished and attentive, they are constantly looking for the up-charge. One egregious example: at Lobby Lounge we were looking to order drinks before heading out to dinner. Cocktails are listed as $20. As we’re ordering the waitress said “ I very highly recommend getting our signature “Gratitude” cocktail. It encompasses everything the Mandarin Oriental New York is about. I really think at least one of you should get it” What she failed to mention was that the cocktail costs $100. When your signature cocktail costs 5 times as much as your other cocktails, and you’re going to sing praises about it and say that we “must” try it --- then I feel like you should also mention to me the cost before ordering it. (note, though, that the cocktails are all wonderful, although I don’t think the Gratitude is worth it or something that you must try… Also, I will say breakfast at Asiate was superb (as an Amex FHR reservation, you get an $80 credit))All in all, I recommend staying at this hotel. There are areas where service could improve especially given the caliber of this hotel and the Mandarin Oriental standard (service at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo was FAR better – it was almost flawless), but you will still feel pampered here nonetheless. The Mandarin Oriental NY is a good choice for a luxurious stay in New York, but given the plethora of luxury hotels in New York, you may want to fully investigate all of your options....","New York, New York, United States","ptn4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, New York, United States</strong>",64,4.0

The New York property is fabulous - stunning views, fantastic staff and impeccably furnished. It is also fabulously expensive, although we were lucky enough to get a third night free offer which made it vaguely affordable!! It is however worth every penny. The views from the lounge and restaurant are stunning. And Christina (the lounge hostess) along with the Paris born restaurant manager (I can't recall his name) were lovely, chatting away to us and making us feel so welcome. We dined in Asiate for lunch yesterday (01/13) and it was just right - both delicious and light. The wine list is extensive, but I'd looked at it on line before we left Scotland, so had already spotted that they had Cakebread Cellars wines in the cellar - always a bonus. We didn't use the spa as we were only there for a long weekend, and there's a lot to see and do in NYC! We stayed in a Hudson River View on the 49th floor, so the view was impressive. The layout wasn't as I'd expected (on the website the bathrooms are long and narrow with the bath under a window, whereas our bathroom had no external window - but was massive and very well appointed, as was the bedroom), so I guess there are several floor plans for this room category. Housekeeping kept the room immaculate, and the Shanghai Tang bathroom products are lovely. Special thanks also to Caroline and the other members of the Concierge team - they were all extremely helpful getting restaurant reservations and giving advice. All in all a FANtastic experience and a lovely way to celebrate my partner's 50th birthday (the hotel marked the occasion with a delicious surprise chocolate and raspberry cake).

However, we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in a nice sized one bedroom suite for what I have paid at similar hotels in NYC for a standard room AND we received our fourth night for free! So, that put me in a great frame of mind should anything have gone wrong. The best news? Nothing went wrong! Our suite was outfitted in comfortable furniture with grey chenille and cream fabrics. The bed was so comfortable that I did not want to leave it the morning. The room was drafty when the curtains were open and the weather was chilly over NYE's, but we just adjusted the thermostat up two degrees when the curtains were open. The wood floors in the parlor and bedrooms were kinda odd, but I became accustomed to them after a few days. We had a generous supply of aromatic toiletries in our narrow bathroom in which one had to be careful and make sure the door to the water closet was closed before opening the bathroom door while entering in or exiting into the bedroom. Our traveling companion actually smashed his fingers into between the two doors in his suite. Ouch!The service was impeccable. We must have had just the best cleaning staff. The fore mentioned wood floors never had a speck of dust on them and the women were as kind as could be. The spa staff was very accommodating and I would like to thank Nicolette and Fini for their superior massage and facial services. Also, the entire bell and doorman staff is to be commended for always being very helpful. Their smiles and pleasant words were appreciated.On NYEs, we left our dinner and arrived back at the Mandarin to help down the party in the lobby lounge. So glad we stopped in for one final glass of champagne as dancing to the fun band and with the late night/early morning revelers was a great way to welcome in 2014.",California,"DinLBC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",73,4.0

Staff is very accommodating and friendly (front desk, concierge, bellman and valet) but housekeeping is not on the same page with the other departments (i should not have staff barging into the room when I am indisposed and unable to answer the door). The promised amenity for my 7 year old was not provided on check-in, but was graciously delivered when asked for, as well as a second little gift for his friend at home.Limited dining options and a less than attentive service at the lobby bar/restaurant are definite strikes. Also, notwithstanding the advertisement on the web site, the internet access is not free. when you sign into the the wifi, you must go to a web page and pick an option of of how you are going to pay for internet access. There are no free options. notwithstanding the room appointments, there was an unexpected and unusually large amount of noise that interrupted sleep. we heard the toilets flush from other rooms and the acoustics do not stop hallway noise at the door. if there is one complaint that will kill a hotel faster for me than anything else, it is the inability to get a good nights sleep.So, if you paid the premium for the view, and suffered all of the other indignities, you have to ask, is the view worth the price and ll of the other baggage?

Instead we got aggravation, beginning with a room that was less than impressive at an average of thousand dollars a night. Expected to walk into a room at the Mandarin and say ""Wow!"" But we said ""This is it?"" The room was small, the furnishings worn and not upscale and the toilet area did not even have a real door on it, but a piece of see-through glass. When we expressed this to the manager, she had said they had no other rooms available to upgrade us to. After wasting nearly an hour on the phone with American Express who had to make several calls to the hotel, we were finally offered a slightly larger room on a lower floor. We were never sent as much as a nice note saying congratulations on your engagement, nevermind a glass of champagne or even a couple chocolates. Upon checkout, We gave plenty of notice that we needed a bellman and a cab to the airport. 20 minutes later no one had arrived and we called the front desk.

It was a deluxe room with park view. It was a truly fantastic stay, where we were totally relaxed, felt valued, and were more than satisfied with the service, accommodation, and meals we received.Pros:• The room was wonderful – well appointed, good storage space, great bed, and enough lighting. While the deco is a bit dated, it appears to be holding up very well. Plus, the maintenance of artworks, furnishings and fixtures seem very current. Loved the views. Must commend the housekeeping staff for their prompt service, consistency and professionalism.• The bathroom is great – good layout, feels luxurious and is equipped with deep soaking tub and powerful showers. Cannot impress how much a well-appointed bathroom can make or break a hotel stay. And this one truly comes out with flying colours. • Public spaces – great, airy, and with such memorable views. Doesn’t ever feel crowded or vacant. Some of the sculptures and artworks can be updated but apart from that, it’s perfect.• Pool and gym – great pool for a workout. Not so good if there are more than 2 swimmers as the waves get very bouncy. Ideally, this pool should have edges that overflow. Gym is sufficient with minimal equipment. Best part is that these facilities are only for hotel guests. Many luxury properties around the world are moving to membership access for their facilities, which gives hotel guests more options, but also more competition. • Restaurant – OMG, best meals ever! And so reasonable for such quality meals. Had breakfasts and lunches here. Loved it, loved the selections and also loved the wonderful views. Highly recommend, especially for the ambiance.• Staff – fantastic! Well done MONY! You’ve certainly shown how much you value staff in ensuring that staff treat all guest with consistent courtesy, professionalism, and kindness. Truly made our stay that much more extraordinary. The best thing about the staff at MONY is that we know we will want to come back over and over again because of how we were treated by them. We found staff at door, porter, concierge, frontdesk, housekeeping, and wait staff with the same professional attitude, friendliness, courtesy and knowledgeable of their roles. Cons:• Minor hiccup with Room Service when we ordered tea one afternoon – it arrived an hour late. By that time, our guests had left and we had no use for the tea.• Lighting switches can be simplified in the rooms. Ideally, the one panel control would be great. • Pool with overflow edges would be great, especially with multiple swimmers.Overall, loved staying here and would definitely describe this as our new luxury retreat in NYC.",Toronto,"HuarenToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",149,5.0

Our first New York visit was in August 2011 when we again stayed at the MO for 5 nights.As other reviews have stated - its not cheap, but then you know that before you book. In my opinion you get what you pay for. The room was spacious, luxurious and well equipped and the en suite was equally luxurious. The staff were attentive, polite and helpful.The dining room again had superb views across the park and we had a table at the window to take full advantage of this, service was second to none.The hotel is sited on the corner of W60th at Columbus Circle. It is in a quiet spot when compared with other hotels in and around Times Square, 5th Avenue etc, yet it is only a 15 minute walk to Times Square or for the less enthusiastic the subway at 59th Street is a 30 second walk away and the entrance to Central Park is just across the road from the subway. The downside ? Yes there were a couple of issues. Firstly our booking which was made through a UK travel agent months in advance was for three adult guests. When we checked in at around 4pm there was a surprised look on the face of the desk staff. We entered our room and found only a double bed in the room. When we returned to the room some 5 hours later after a walk to Times Square, some shopping and a meal, we were still a bed short. It took a phone call and another 30 minute wait before the room was complete.The second issue - WiFi. If the Apple Store on 5th Avenue can provide free WiFi for anybody that walks into the store (no purchase necessary) then surely a 5* hotel shouldn't be charging paying guests for their WiFi usage ?? OK, perhaps a pre set download limit per day could be free and then charge for all downloads in excess of that, but charging for any usage ?? We walked to the Apple Store and kept in touch with home courtesy of them, when we should have been able to do it from the comfort of our 5* room for the same cost - nothing. Come on Mandarin, you're charging enough for me to stay with you, where are the perks ??Enough said, these issues didnt spoil our stay and YES, I'd stay there again when we next get the chance to visit NYC","Manchester, United Kingdom","Chris P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",24,5.0

It was our second stay at the Mandarin Oriental. The hotel has went downhill a bit since we stayed there almost 5 years ago. The location is still fantastic, obviously, but the ammenities, service and overall feel were not the ""5 star"" experience we were expecting. A few things stand out that brought the hotel down a notch including some mold in the shower - in a 5 star - really? Lack of pillow choice / uncomfortable pillows. We visited the lobby bar several times during the trip, you can't beat the view for a pre-dinner cocktail but were disappointed with the breakfast buffet and had a bad coffee experience one afternoon. When you're paying the 5 star prices, you expect close to perfection and this time the Mandarin Oriental failed to deliver. All-in-all, still a very enjoyable stay but we will be looking at other options for our next trip to New York.","Calgary, Canada","jjhrtraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",44,4.0

I was able to find a fairly low rate of $595 for one night compared to their usual rates of $800 however as a result I believe I was given the worse room in their collection. First the room was seriously outdated and in great need of a renovation. Bedding was substandard for a five star hotel. The bathroom was the worst thing that I ever saw. A brown shower curtain for the shower stall that did not hold in the water. A shower faucet that kept breaking during use. A rain shower that truly was satisfactory at best. A washroom door partition that was broken and off the hinges. The TV in the bathroom was also hanging from some wires; awful. And the truth be told that the shower was not perfectly clean. The concierge, while friendly gave me the incorrect information pertaining to the opening hours of a department store.At the end of a very quick stay, I complained to the necessary individuals and had my entire room charge deducted. I was not going to pay one penny for a hotel room that was not functional, nor esthetically pleasing to the eye. I later find out that the hotel gave my wife and I an accessible room, although we are not physically challenged. As a seasoned traveler I know that hotels who see someone paying a lower rate, give away their accessible rooms instead of their regular rooms. I find this practice to be unacceptable and quite frankly rude. Hotels should keep these accessible rooms always available to those guests that may require them. Not sell them out to anyone. And the hotel should inform the guest upon check-in that in fact the room that they are going to give you is an accessible room with the following modifications. It should be up to the guest if then they want to continue in this type of room or ask for another one, after all we are the ones who are paying the rate.What disappointed me the most was my initial impression of the Mandarin Oriental Hotels as something of luxury. Their ads always claim that these Hollywood Superstars stay at their properties. Well folks, first hand I experienced the Mandarin Oriental NYC and unless you a super-rich and do not care about what you are paying and what you are receiving this hotel then is for you. I care about how much I pay, and I have no problems paying for a great room. Unfortunately what you pay is not what you get at this hotel. I am quite surprised that in NYC for that matter the Mandarin Oriental is not luxurious, in fact quite the opposite, I would classify as ordinary on the verge of unpleasant.I had a better shower at a Town Suites of Marriott by the airport in Buffalo then I had at the Mandarin Oriental. $800 for a room compared to a Town Suites room at $169. You do the math. Save your money and stay somewhere else. If you are looking for an outstanding five star hotel in the city, check out The Chatwal Hotel. I recently stayed there and while I may have experienced some difficulties during my stay, the rooms were beautiful and tremendously luxurious for a much more reasonable price than the Mandarin Oriental.I am curious to return to the Mandarin Oriental NYC to see for myself if in fact the rooms are all of poor quality and standard that I received during my most recent stay. I am hopeful they are not because if they are there are a lot of folks on tripadvisor who are being ripped off for what they are receiving.","Toronto, Canada","FirstClass001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",647,2.0

The ballroom is a dream with the most spectacular views of Columbus Circle and Central Park, In my opinion the best views in NYC. The service and the food were by far the finest any of us have ever had... But the wedding was what is was because of the extremely talented and creative Associate Director of Catering, James Munz, who in my opinion is the gem of any event that takes place at the Mandarin. His knowledge and experience blew us away, but his personality made working with him the best experience for my husband and I. I have been to and have hosted many events but this was the smoothest, finest and most organized team of people I have ever worked with. Over 100 of our family and friends stayed at the hotel for the wedding and all of us were cared for beyond our expectations. The hotel rooms are stunning and the beds a dream to sleep in.

After eating out all week at expensive locations I felt that it was a bit pricey and was confused over the a la carte menu and the set menu. The staff we're EXTREMELY friendly and polite as well as understanding that it was a pricey restaurant. After my parents and I conversing in Danish the only language they are fluent in, we decided that it was just too pricey and wanted to just eat at the Plaza, the hostess then got her manager and to my amaze kept offering us different alternatives and maybe try out the lounge as it's more affordable and they would give us an a la carte menu, however we would not be allowed to sit there because my brother is under 21. As my parents did not understand what they we're talking about, they simply told me we should just leave and eat somewhere else and they walked towards to elevators. As they left the hostess and manager kept offering me alternatives - which is so rare in New York, let's be honest, people there are incredibly rude and have a ""don't care"" attitude. They even offered us to eat at an a la carte menu in a more private dinning room. But it was too late my family just wanted to leave as my brothers age prohibited our dinning options and felt it wasn't a very family friendly dinning experience. The hostess and manager of Asiate we're superb and just so overly friendly which was a comfort after staying in a cold and unfriendly city for a week. I do hope this gets back to her I wasn't able to get her name, but it was really touching service something so unexpected in New York. Although I didn't even eat there the Asiate's service was impeccable. They are the image and definition of truly immaculate customer service.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","MJL590</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",17,5.0

Nor do I, so we’re the perfect match…The Mandarin Oriental is quite simply the best. Good enough for the A-list (of which we saw our fair share), we had room 4308 overlooking Columbus Circus and the incomparable Central Park. With a chaise longue and floor to ceiling glass walls tempting you to do nothing but take in that view, we were thoroughly spoilt. Exceptional customer service, a pool on the 35th floor overlooking the Hudson River, an ever-so trendy lounge bar where you can mingle with the cool folk and Sunday brunch taken in the Asiate restaurant with its panoramic views were just some of the things I loved about this plush hotel.Location, location, location… The Mandarin Oriental sits as part of the Time Warner Center on the edge of Central Park, where we took a long walk. It’s a people-watching, bird-spotting paradise. In the other direction is Times Square, the Highline Park which we so enjoyed walking through, and the Rockefeller Center, which offers, in my opinion, the best views of the Manhattan skyline. Despite this being my sixth trip to NYC I had never been on the Staten Island ferry that glides past the Statue of Liberty so we did that, and of course we did our fair share of partying. The Meatpacking District offers up some cool bars and check out Bleecker Street for delicious and inexpensive world cuisine. Each time I visit New York it gives me something new to spot and adore.

I first visited this property around two years ago. I arrived very late that time, but was still greeted by name (which continued throughout my stay). The service was excellent, even to the point that the lounge kitchen stayed open late to cook me a bite to eat. However, when I went to my Premier Central Park View Room, I recall surprise at finding the bathroom in slight disarray to the point where I wondered if someone had been in the room after housekeeping had come through. But the hour was late and I was too tired to complain. I chalked it up to sloppy housekeeping in what was an otherwise short but nice visit. Unfortunately, that should have been a sign. Fixated on the Mandarin's impressive 35th floor bar and its jaw-dropping pool and common areas (rather than on the sloppy bathroom from my first go around), I returned to the hotel for a three night stay in the Hudson River View Room Double. I have friends in the city and could have crashed in their small apartments, but I was hoping to get some pampering and good sleep. It turns out I should have couch-surfed.No greeting by name awaited me this time (or really, at any other time except when I spoke by phone with hotel staff who would then pause and mispronounce my name off their computer screen). In fact, even though I called hours before to let the front desk know the approximate time of my early evening arrival, housekeeping was still ""readying my room"" when I got there. This, at 7pm at night! The front desk apologized (Apology #1) and comped some drinks in the lounge. When it was eventually ready, my room turned out to be fine (the bathroom was sparkling) and came with a surprisingly nice view. I was satisfied that all was well. That is, until I was awoken by the sound of what sounded like a combined saw and jack-hammer inside the walls at 9am. The noise only got worse, and I called down to the front desk to find out if I could expect this to continue for the rest of my stay. The front desk manager apologized (Apology #2), and explained that a suite above/below me as under construction -I got different answers on this depending on who I spoke to. He seemed genuinely sorry and discounted the room by 50% for that night. Unfortunately, the noise was so bad I couldn't even get ready in my bathroom and so I went down to the spa to shower up. The spa cost was comped (as it should have been, since my room was unusable). When I came back that evening, there was an apology note from the front desk with some chocolates. ""A very rough start,"" I thought, but two more nights to go.Although I didn't have the pleasure of waking to jack hammering for the rest of my stay, I was instead treated to a symphony of slamming doors and loud hall conversation. I am fairly sure that I didn't get more than a few hours consecutive sleep before someone decided to conduct an entire business negotiation in Spanish right outside my door, or before the child from the lovely West African family still operating on Ivory Cost time (the Mandarin Oriental is highly international) decided it was entertaining at 5am to repeatedly slam the door to her parents room. ""Perhaps, the Mandarin has decided to go truly realistic and use paper walls in furtherance of its East Asian theme,"" I mused in my half-awake state. In total earnest, the noise problem is very serious. No one who is a light sleeper should even consider this hotel. When I finally checked out after my third night, exhausted, the front desk asked how my stay had been. I related my continuing noise issues, and received in turn a beautiful apology (Apology #3) worthy of an off-Broadway play.Although I respect the fact that the Mandarin staff did what they could to address my concerns, the truth is that these issues should never have occurred at the first place. I would have gladly paid full price and returned all the comps and theatrical apologies for what I truly wanted, which was a decent night's sleep. Sadly, that was the one thing that I could not have. At a hotel that bills itself as one of the best in New York, an inability to deliver on this one critical point is unacceptable.","Houston, Texas","RenardFX</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",36,3.0

Tiny closets. Visibly deferred maintenance (minor but not acceptable at this price point).

The average rate per night was $1600, the most I have ever paid for a room anywhere in the world. Overall, considering the value for the price and the service flaws, I would say that there are many much better values in the city.In an effort to be as balanced as possible, I will write first about the pluses for this property. If you are interested in being near or on Central Park / Columbus Circle the hotel is in a great location. The views over Central Park are beautiful, albeit blocked partially by the Trump hotel. Room service did a great job with breakfast orders each morning and one late night dessert order. In particular I was very impressed with Derek from room service. The furnishings are very nice and the bathroom, especially the shower, were well presented with great pressure from the rain shower. Finally, my previous request for Red Flower bath amenities to be placed in my room was honored prior to check in.On the downside and overall the reason I would rate this hotel Poor/Average are based on service and follow up. On the evening of check-in the TV in the living room was not working. I called the front desk and the IT department came quickly and reset the TV. The next morning, we wanted to have breakfast in our room and watch our morning dose of news channels and again the TV was not working. I called the front desk and asked that someone from IT be sent to fix it. By 11 that morning without a response and upon leaving for the day I called the front desk again. Was placed on hold. Called the operator and asked to speak to the Manager on Duty. Was told that person was unavailable. Left a detailed message with the MOD describing the situation and asking that it be resolved by the time we returned in the evening. On return at 530 pm, had two messages, one from the MOD and one from the IT department asking me to call them back and describe the problem. At this point, very frustrated, called the MOD again and asked that the TV be fixed. Upon return at about 11pm that evening, TV still not working. At this point, extremely frustrated, called the MOD again and spoke at length to him about service expectations not being met, value for price paid, etc. While it was late, we agreed that someone would come to fix the TV the next morning after we had left for the day. At this point, no TV for two of the three mornings that we had on our holiday. The next day when we returned in the evening the TV was fixed (actually replaced the set top box as it wasn't working properly). To be fair, the hotel MOD sent a bottle of wine and a note of apology and credited my folio with a 50% discount on one night of the stay. While I appreciated the gesture I was overall very disappointed with the follow up and with the experience. For those who wish a luxury experience I highly recommend the Greenwich hotel. For those who enjoy luxury in a cutting edge neighborhood the value provided by the Nomad Hotel is very good.As a result of this experience I cancelled an upcoming reservation for a suite at the Mandarin in Las Vegas for a stay in March.","Miami, Florida","Miamiboys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",77,3.0

If you want to enjoy swimming after the movie or dinner, there is no chance. Other hotels around the world have hours mostly from 6 am to 11 pm. It could be true only for swimming pool, sauna and fitness, but obviously in this hotel it is a problem. Mentioning sauna - that is another story - nowhere around the world I had such a bad experience with the sauna-it is not warm enough, after being there for one hour you can't get sweaty. Because I need to use a sauna for my health, I complained many times , but I was always told that sauna has regular temperature. Every single person using this sauna was complaining to me as well, but they are not here so many times, therefore they don't care so much.

I am familiar with the MO group, I have stayed at their Las Vegas property twice in the past. And to me the MO Las Vegas is one of my favorite hotels in the world. But now that I experience the MO New York, I think I have a new favorite. It was above amazing, above anything I dreamed of. The check In was quick and efficient, very polite and hospitable (very common of the MO brand). They have this asian hospitality touch that I do not find in any other hotel chain in the world. As we get in the elevator, we smell the familiar and beautiful Mandarin Oriental scent (the one there seem to be in most of their property). Before getting into the room. I really must insist on how beautiful, high class and solid everything looks. The design of each area of the hotel is really a work of art, pure luxury. They gave us a small upgrade, highest floor of the hotel and corner room facing the hudson river. It was nice being on the top floor of the hotel (54th), and the corner room really seemed to make the room bigger. We also had a larger view, from hudson river to columbus circle. The room was quiet large for New York standard. Maybe the corner rooms are larger than the regular ones, it's possible. The room looked so stunning, there's no word to describe the feel. Everything was so well designed and placed, we felt the feng shui 100%. Every detail, scent, the decor, the appliances, the quality of every single piece in the room is absolutely perfect. The bathrooms is so large and clean. We had a nice view of midtown from the bathtub. And all the bath amenities were amazing. The tv was great, lots of channels and the original Mandarin Oriental video and song which really fits with their MO atmosphere. Also there's a nice option of the tv to check the weather in the city and in your hometown, an updated folio of your spendings etc. The slippers and bathrobes are amazing, so comfortable. The bed is heavenly and the linens also. You could sleep for days. As I said they really went through every detail, and as a Mandarin Oriental fan, I got my ''fix''. Outside the room.. The Lobby lounge is great, excellent for a coffee, drinks, or a small snack. It is usually very busy so making a reservation is prudent. But if you make it from your room, they can call you in your room when your table is ready and you can go down in a minute as simple as that. Such amazing service. The pool area is also superb, I went back to the pool every single day. The pool which is huge by the way, is on the 36th floor and you have a view on the nyc skyline. Also in the pool area you have the fitness center, it has new top quality equipment. There's showers, with Espa products and a sauna also. All this is complimentary if you stay the hotel or reside in the residences. The residences are located above the hotel and have a different entrance/elevator. The Spa at Mandarin Oriental New York is great. Unfortunately the one in their Las Vegas property is better, bigger and fuller. But this one in New York is good enough. I spent 2 hours there and felt very relaxed. Next time I will try a treatment because everyone that was coming out of the spa after a treatment looked like they had the best time of their lives. They also have great products for sale at the Spa Boutique.I didn't have the chance to eat at their restaurant ''Asiate'' but I've heard good things and next time I'll make sure to go. But we ordered Breakfast in the room three days in a row. It was always excellent, the pastries are so delicious.I don't understand why the hotel is not better rated in Tripadvisor, after reading a few reviews I am confused by the deception of some people. It is truly a gem and makes you feel so good and serene. I hope their prices don't go up because it's already high enough, probably the most expensive hotel in New York. Because I want to return there over and over again.Thank you Mandarin Oriental.","Berlin, Germany","HG56</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",69,5.0

On arrival, we were greeted by the door staff before heading up to the lobby on the 35th floor. the view striked you straight away as you look through the lobby onto the floor to ceiling windows overlooking Central Park.The Reception staff were outstanding (recognised our Geordie accents and talked about Newcastle United and Liverpool FC with great knowledge) and gave us a higher room due to our 5-night stay. The room itself was very well decorated and felt clean and fresh. We've stayed in a number of 'high-end' hotels in NYC and this beats them all - and at half the price of some of the others. It might not have the history of the Pierre, Carlyle or Astoria, but being a Brit, century old buildings with old fashioned decor aren't something I crave for (being it's all we see at home), so bright and modern was perfect for us.Plenty of the water in the room each day, good range of TV channels, fantastic bathroom with sunflower head shower and bath, robes for both etc. Pretty much everything you'd expect and very well done.The breakfasts in Asiate were amazing, as was the light snacks served in the lounge. All staff were friendly and approachable - the opposite to some hotels where the brand has gone to the staffs heads and they act like Lord and Lady of the Manor e.g. snooty and aloof. The team at the MO are professional, but down-to-earth - the perfect mix.Location wise, the MO sits atop of the Time Warner, with its huge food court, high end shops, coffee bars and wealth of restaurants, including the famous Per Se that the concierge helped us book into. The subway hub sits 25-mteres away, whilst your in Central Park within 30-seconds of leaving the front door.Price wise, the hotel is what you'd expect. It's not astronomical for a breakfast and coffee, but it isn't McDonalds either. For breakfast for two with coffee, water and orange, we paid around $70 at the most. You're looking at similair prices for a light bite in the lounge overlooking Central Park. We didn't dine on the evenings, so we can't comment here.We also had use of the house car, which was available quite a few times, but we only sought out once.

Happily, we found perfection at the Mandarin Oriental. First if all, it is a wonderful location for watching the Macy's parade. Central Park is at your doorstep for those who wish to run as well as those who prefer a playground. The pool on the 36th floor welcomed children and provided a lovely afternoon break from the sightseeing, ice skating, and shopping.Best of all was the pampering five star luxury combined flawlessly with a child friendly attitude.Whether pouring a fine chablis or fixing the lid on a glass of milk, the wait staff out did themselves. Housekeeping was impeccible. The concierge was available for every request (including a seamtress to alter a ""just bought it but must wear it on Thanksgiving"" dress.) The top floor corner suite, 5416, has a breathtaking view.

When we checked in, we were told that we would not need a reservation for breakfast, but the next morning, were told we could be seated, but that others had reservations so we would have to leave in an hour. We then waited for 45 mins for our meals and had to rush to eat them. The breakfast prices were exorbitant as well. The swimming pool was chilly, and not enjoyable.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Central Park before and although it is a very nice hotel, it is in an older building so the windows are much smaller and there are only 12 or 15 floors, so you really can't see much of Central Park or the city.Breakfast was part of our package and everyday the food was delicious and service was very good.There is a beautiful lounge on the 35th floor which has a great design and fantastic views of the city and central park. Unfortunately we did not have access to it for any of the 4 nights we stayed there as it was rented out for private parties. The lounge would be a terrific location for drinks before dinner...or any time. The fact that it was not available to the hotel's normal guests for 4 nights in a row is unacceptable in my opinion.

My family and I did a two-day excursion to New York and wanted to stay near shows and Gallagher's restaurant (which we love, but that's another review). Our travel agent works with clients who expect the best, and booked us a one bedroom suite with another adjoining bedroom. When we arrived, nothing was ready. The suite we eventually were given was the wrong room type, and the ""connecting"" room was non-existant. They did move us to a suite that was an upgrade, but we had to settle for a second room that was next door, not connecting. Aside from the errors, I just didn't like this hotel. If you want to be in the action on the West Side, the location is wonderful, and some of the rooms have great views. However, the first suite we were given had floor to ceiling glass at a sharp, pointed angles (terrible for anyone afraid of heights), and severely modern furnishings. It came across as cold and harsh rather than luxurious, and I love contemporary decor. Not this one. In addition, it felt like they ""dumped"" us in the room. None of the amenities arranged by the travel agent were present (a little snack, sometimes flowers), and although they knew the accommodations were wrong, we were told just to wait there. Overall, we didn't get a ""welcoming"" feeling in this hotel at all. New York is one of those cities where it's important for me to feel the hotel is our ""oasis"" in the big city. These were VERY expensive accommodations, and couldn't compare with the Four Seasons, new Ritz Carlton or any number of other fine New York hotels in this category. At this price, it should have five stars.","Chicago, Illinois","regulartraveler705</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",40,3.0

Perfectly located, this hotel is luxurious and expensive. We had a central park view room on the 42nd floor. The room was fine albeit a bit cluttered with large furniture. You pay a lot for these rooms and one of the reasons is obviously the park view. However a word of caution - our view included the multi-storey trump hotel immediately in front of us - not sure how many of the park view rooms have their view almost obliterated by trump? Despite this, the location is exceptional - adjacent to the park, connected to the mall (oh, for a Whole Foods in our town), access to the subway on the doorstep and lots of lovely restaurants and bars to hand. One experience which is a must-do is a cocktail in the Lobby Lounge at dusk. The view is amazing. Book a table by the window. Another must-do is a swim the lap pool - looking out over the Hudson from 30-odd floors up as you swim is awesome. Staff very good and helpful. Gabriel at reception worthy of mention. Would recommend the hotel but if your main reason for booking it is the view, I would proceed with caution and check out what you will get for your money.

First, I am very familiar with the hotel as it's a go-to hotel for business meetings and conferences in NY. However, this was my first time staying as an overnight hotel guest. I arrived hours later than I thought since I was caught in a torrential rainstorm on way back from airport. I was tired and grumpy when I arrived. Front desk could not have been more efficient and accommodating of my special requests (fridge in room, open the windows, and some others). Just yes, yes, yes to everything I asked. I think the young man's name was Sam and he was the perfect combination of gracious and fast. We had a Hudson room with a view - but for us, that was not important. What we loved was the enormous bathroom (almost 1/3 of the total square footage I think). Generous/separate shower and bathtub. Just a feeling of luxury. And everything was immaculately clean. I didn't LOVE the bed (too firm), but I'm super fussy and have an amazing bed at home - so don't go by me.Room service was better than average, with an interesting selection of things for lunch (lots of asian selections). I loved that when I ordered room service breakfast, I could step out to get a few things outside and they told me if we weren't in the room when room service came they would just set it up for us. Do you know how wonderful it is to come back to a room with a piping hot breakfast waiting for you? You have to try the fruit salad with mangos and strawberries and kiwis, it was a bit of heaven.

At some hotels, the staff can be so precise and business-like that they lose that natural human warmth, but I never felt that at this hotel. The lobby on the 35th floor is stunning with amazing views of Central Park and the surrounding city. We enjoyed dining at the Lobby Lounge and the signature restaurant Asiate and both were outstanding. Our room was a premier park view room on the 47th floor. The room was handsome and inviting with a beautiful marble bathroom. From the window I could see the Hudson River to the north, Central Park in the middle and the red CNN sign to the south. It was just an amazing panoramic view of Manhattan. Housekeeping did a great job maintaining our room and the hotel supplied child sized robes for my two children. The hotel also graciously presented my kids with a beautiful book about NYC and crayons and coloring books. We also received a tea presentation shortly after we arrived in our room which was delightful. The hotel was immaculate everywhere I looked. We enjoyed swimming in the pool which was perfect.

For one thing, we would expect a hotel of this category to place utmost importance on ""attention to details"" prior to, and especially throughout the guests' entire stay.One request I always make prior to our arrival is regarding the rollaway bed. I would e-mail the hotels prior to arrival, as I did in this case, and instruct that the rollaway bed NOT to be set-up until after we have checked-in to our room and preferably done during the usual turn down service because we like to have the room in a neat and uncluttered fashion and so we can take nice photographs. In this instance, I received an acknowledgement from the hotel that they would gladly accommodate the request. We feel this to be a simple request. However, upon our entry to the room, I was dismayed to find the roll-away not ""set-up"" as confirmed, BUT instead, vertically propped up against the living room window blocking out the entire Central Park views that was the main feature of this suite (this is shown in the attached pictures)! I had to call the front desk to instruct the bed to be removed and set-up during turn-down service. The front desk was apologetic and sent up housekeeping to rectify the matter. This first impression of our arrival was of imperfection and slightly disappointed with complete lack of ""attention to details"" that led to this.It may have pleased me that housekeeping who showed up then specifically asked me if I wanted the bed removed each day during room make up and brought back in during turn down service, to which I cheerfully said yes. However, this courteous offer actually led to further disappointment after it was never carried out as promised. Another instance of overlooking the details.Concierge services appeared attentive and helpful at first contact. However, the large team of concierges and rotation of duty without systematic passing over of information leads to confusion amongst themselves and for the guest. I commend each concierge individually for the assistance they provide, but the rotation system should reviewed as to ensure a seamless process for guests.Housekeeping services should improve response time. Many times, we have already forgotten that we had made a request before someone shows up over half-an-hour later.The suite was generally clean but a part of the carpet was soaking wet and the dusty curtains triggered allergy symptoms on our part, which we could live with but rarely experienced at other 5-star hotels in the same category as MO.Most of these are minor shortcomings but more importantly, they demonstrate the lack of attention to details and coordination which should not happen at an MO property. The million dollar views compensated for all the small annoyances we faced and allowed us to enjoy our stay for the most part and provide an overall rating of 4/5 stars. This is not to complain, but bring the management's attention to all the little things that can make a guests stay perfect, as an MO experience should be. We hope this will be taken as constructive feedback for further improvement, for the comfort of others expecting the 'MO way'.","Bangkok, Thailand","PourPaul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",850,4.0

I think there are probably hotels that are even more luxerous, but what I really liked is that this hotel does not overdo it. So its luxury, but without the golden design and quiet voices.

The hotel is very nice but felt quite ""average"" for a 5-star hotel and certainly not worth the US$895 room rate. If you want real 5-star quality and service, this is not the place. Go to the St. Regis or Pierre. I had high expectations for this hotel because it had been written up so frequently in travel magazines but it was literally the worst Mandarin Oriental I have stayed at, granted the only other Mandarin Oriental Hotels I have stayed at have been in Asia. I would have given this hotel a 4 rating because service and quality is not bad but for what you pay, you would expect, much, much better.Pros:- Location. This hotel is at the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. One block from Central Park and close to almost all subway lines.- Very comfortable bed.- Separate shower and bath tub.Cons:- Room is small-ish. Hotel rooms tend to be moderate in NY but for what you pay, it just seemed too small.- Rooms overall felt a bit worn, I know this hotel has not been around for too long but the rooms felt like there was not alot of maintenance put into them.- Only one sink in bathroom.- Small gym. But then again, you are one block from Central Park, where running is amazing.- Service was average. It seemed like the staff were generally well-intentioned but standards are just low. For example, when I arrived, the guy at the door asked if I wanted help with luggage. At the Mandarin in Hong Kong, Jakarta, KL and Macau - no one ever ASKS if you need help. They just help! However, I think this may just be an American thing.- So expensive. $895 a night.

I asked for the separate blankets for the bed, and the hotel was despite 4 attempts unsuccessful in setting them up that the eiderdowns were covered by the bed sheets that I wouldn't have to wake up wrapped in the disgusting stained eiderdowns (with the sheets shifting during the sleep). Not what you expect from a hotel that charges 1000 $ a night! The manager invited me to have breakfast on the hotel. I was told that the hotel doesn't reserve specific tables by the widow an that they would be assigned on a first come first serve basis. When I entered the restaurant and escorted to my table, I spotted an empty table right at the window. When I asked to be seated at this table, I was told that this was reserved for an important guest who enjoys sitting next to the window!?! After 5 minutes the host came back to reseat us next to the window. At that time I was already so upset that I didn't care what table they would give me.I don't mind spending money for value, however in this case I got to be an idiot to ever return to this hotel!","Munich, Germany","GermanWorldTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",99,2.0

I think the property has incredible service0 I love the brand and LOVE the bar / bar staff especially. Rooms are small and not nearly as great as I had hoped. However my big disappointment was the Spa. I received a 90 minute spa treatment gift for my birthday (so excited!) - the price was ~$375.00 (twice the cost of most nice spas in NYC) which did shock me, but expected the value to measure up.First off, the spa is MUCH smaller than I thought. Upon arrival, you take off your shoes in this small sterile check-in area, sit there barefoot with the little slippers, surrounded by other tourists/customers right next to you, and then 5 or so minutes later finally get to go inside. The lockerroom facilities are very small- to the point where you are very near the entrance, so if you are changing and someone walks in, there is literally no privacy whatsoever. The best part about the spa is the whirlpool jacuzzi and steamroom- great facilities that I loved. HOWEVER, the therapist I had was possibly one of the worst ever. I had to ask repeatedly for her to go deeper (the most gentle and boring massage I have ever had, and I get treatments monthly)- she never asked how the treatment was. My biggest pet peeve is having to continually ask for something, feel bad about it, and then have to ask again- I'm supposed to be relaxed and not thinking! They also use basic white towels as opposed to soft sheets/bedding, and the floor to ceiling windows makes it hard to have a nice dark room which I like during massages. Overall I am very disappointed- for that price tag I really should have walked away feeling incredible.Equinox, just under the hotel, is half the price and has much better therapists, from what I have experienced.","New York City, New York","clutchbomb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,2.0

Don't get me wrong, the hotel and the rooms are nice, but ONLY nice, nothing to write home about, there are much better deluxe hotels in New York for half the price.Rooms are typical New York size, quite small. We reserved a grand deluxe and was given a room on the 43rd floor. These rooms were very compact and quite dark, considering they boast they have floor to ceiling windows. We complained and were given a Hudson view room on the 49th floor. The view from these rooms were much better, and the bathroom was very nice - it even had a window above the bath, although you couldn't see out of it when sitting in the bath.The bath room amenities were nothing special, and there is NO bath or shower gel, only shampoo, condition, body wash, and bath crystals for the bath. Minimum number of towels were provided - 3 for 2 adults.The rooms do not have any coffee making facilities, and no chocolates for turn down :-(Staff at the front desk were friendly enough, but when we had to change rooms we were told that we had to come down and get the new keys, as there was not enough staff to bring them up - so, paying $1000 per night to the hotel and they can't even provide a service!!We had made a reservation for Brunch in the restaurant for the following Sunday. before we arrived. Upon check-in, we asked if they could check on this for us, and found that there was no reservation. The restaurant called us in our room to confirm that we now had a reservation for breakfast at 11am on Saturday - we said that we want brunch on Sunday, not Saturday. The following night (Saturday) we checked with the concierge that our reservation for Sunday brunch was all confirmed. They called back and said that our reservation was for today, Saturday, and that we never showed up....... they finally made the correct reservation - truly 5 star service don't you think?I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a nice hotel to stay at in New York.","Salt Lake City, Utah","Zigenbock</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",109,1.0

Everywhere you go, everything you see are just rivers, buildings and more buildings. It gets a bit crazy that even if you were to get up to Empire State Building, are still rivers, buildings and more buildings, though from a different perspective. Now back to Mandarin Oriental, New York, let's just say if you can afford S$1,000.00 plus a night then go for this hotel as it is luxury and high-end for New York City standard. First the rooms, I was fortunate to be staying in the Deluxe Hudson River View room which as it states, overlooks Hudson River. Being first time in New York City, I believed the rooms at Mandarin Oriental, New York are among the largest in similar category hotels. Big beds, spacious bathroom and great evening views from the Deluxe Hudson River View Room. There are also novels for your reading pleasure in which one may bring home at the end of the stay. Considering the price tag of paying for the room, why not! However, I would not recommend one to book the standard rooms as the view is partially blocked from Columbus Circus and is not very nice. Since you already decided to stay here, why not splurge more. Another thing I love about this hotel is the swimming pool and gym located on the 35th Floor with decent size. Did not try the restaurant but the view is great and Asiate is voted is rated by Zaget as having the restaurant with the best view. Location: Fantastic. On Columbus Circus in Time Warner Centre with shops and restaurants nearby and of course great spot to start walking Central Park from the south. Overall, go for it if you are willing to splurge!

And it truly is an ""almost"" perfect experience. When we checked in (we booked the room through American Express Platinum concierge) the front desk clerk was truly, truly delighted to upgrade us to a one bedroom suite without our even asking for it! That's the wonderful thing about this hotel--they seem genuinely thrilled to serve you. The food in the lobby bar was pretty good, the drinks are absolutely GREAT. We loved our one bedroom suite--probably a $3,000 per night value that they gave us (for a $995 charge). The two things I would point out that would prevent this from being flawless: the housekeeping somehow assumed I was a solo traveler and only did turn down service for one person (i.e., one pair of slippers, one bottle of water). I think at a hotel like this, they should know how many people are in the room. And, there was a strange ticking noise in the heating unit that night (it seemed to fade away as time passed). But truly, WHO CARES, when we were upgraded to such a wonderful room? Also, the spa is quite expensive ($360 for a massage) and when I checked in, the staff were whispering and arguing over something on the computer and took a long time to acknowledge my presence. Not exactly the experience you want when you are dropping this kind of money. We liked brunch at the Asiate restaurant. It's a good value (though the service is a little bit harried). Overall, this is a wonderful place, one we will return to time and again. We consider it ""our place"" and we can't wait to return.

May is because I'm from Barcelona and I helped a girlfriend with a tourist guide visiting hotels around that I'm already immune to just design and they have to be more creative than that.I know the size of the rooms in Manhattan are small, but dam this was small to the point specially considering the prize.Beautiful view sure; The Pierre own by the Taj Hotel group has better ones.

The first time we had to call twice to get something, we wrote it off as a busy weekend, but after 4 days, it was just unexceptable at the prices being charged. The room service food is delicious, but the attention to detail is just not there--for example, my husband preordered breakfast with cold cereal and coffee--the milk for the cereal came steamed. Other irritations as well, such as no doormen or bellman at the ground floor to help with doors, packages, etc. On marathon morning, I preordered 4 bags of ice to be left in the bathroom tub in bags for my husband for post-race icing...when we returned from the race, there was one baggie- sized bag of ice melting on a tray in the living room. It took 2 phone calls to sort that out. There were several other incidents, but it's not necessary to list them all.

When we made the reservation we were told there was a ""wedding discount"" however the price we were quoted was the same price listed as rack rate on the website. When we asked about this, we were promised and had confirmation of an upgraded corner room at the lower listed price. As part of the bridal party, we needed to be there early in the day, and had also arranged for early check in-which we were told would be no problem. Great. Arrived around 1pm, and were told we were being given a basic room. My husband stated we had been approved for an upgrade. The desk assistant said that the price didn't reflect that, but then went on to say she would honor it (after we showed her our e-mailed confirmation) however that room was also not ready. We were low key about all this, assuming we could leave our bags and go start getting ready (hair appointment, etc). Pro: The room was ready about 30min later, Con: If I had known it would be that quick, I would have waited for the key so I could go wash up first, instead I was half way across town. When we finally got into our room, it did not seem like it was either a corner view or an upgraded room, which felt like they had been dishonest with us. Too much else to do to follow up on it. Still, the room was clean, comfortable, and had a great view of central park. Loved the creature comforts of the fainting couch, the books in the room, the rain shower and the bathrobes.

After that it appeared that there was no price list for the mini bar in the room either… We ordered some champagne in room and the girl who I was making my order with was actually rude – she kept demanding some number but didn’t have a clue to explain this to me – this number appeared to be some internal code given to each vine bottle in the menu. A guy who brought us the wine was actually the nicest stuff member we came across. To sum it up the room was ok but taking into account our total bill which was around US$1,000 for an overnight stay and a bottle of a not extravagant champagne I would definitely advise another hotel for a trip to NYC with a more nicer and a more client appreciative stuff especially if it is your personal trip.","Barcelona, Spain","InLoveNY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",23,2.0

The Lounge, Bedroom and Bathroom are very well set out, and do easily support a week stay on Business.The Hotel truly stands out in almost everything they offer, all service areas are well maintained and top shape, only down turn (this was our 2nd stay here 1st in 2006) is the F&B Department; which used to be fantastic during our 1st stay.We enjoyed 2 times Breakfast in the room, very well set up, perfectly served and great variety. The Lounge offers great snacks and drinks, service however is no longer at the drive and attentiveness it used to have.The Bar is still the hot spot, very busy in the evening with great cocktails and nice snack food, however the waitress is pushy and likes it her way, you just need to push back and things fall into place. As an example:The 2 of us used a Cocktail table for 4 and the place was full, another couple asks if they can sit down at our table and we agreed. Strange things do happen our days, the waitress refused to serve them! As per company policy only one check per table!! Try to understand that one!!!The big disappointment was the Restaurant!Again we did stay here before and the F&B Department was out of this world, likewise as their Hotel in Miami; said to say things have changed. The Food for sure is still of perfect quality and very well presented; the Service however has much to upgrade. The friendliness for which the place was know (we go the extra mile to make you smile) is no longer.We came for the Sunday Brunch with a party of 4 at 1pm had a few drinks before lunch, during lunch 1 btl of wine. The Brunch was served at 1.45pm, first course, soup was placed at the same time, main course arrived at 2pm shortly followed by the dessert.

You can't have a great first impression wondering what else she forgot.Second impression: Went down to use beautiful pool--it's closed. Perhaps they should have told me about that issue and that one of their finest features was closed.Third impression: Lighting and technology. If it takes you 2-3 days to learn how to get the lights back on or the master lighting switch reset, then your customers will always be frustrated. If your keys are so cool that people can't get into their rooms, that's a problem. If the building requires you to take two elevators to get to your room every time you step into the building, then that's a problem as well.If your customers try to get to the pool and the hallways are darkened to the point that it feels like you're in a fright house, then that's a problem.If you set up a nice poolside private dinner and the sandwiches are put on a hot plate for two hours in advance, then that's not very tasty.Colleagues can't visit each other on different floors without a major headache because te keys only get you to the correct floor, if the elevators are working correctly. Just to visit another room required both people to get to an ""open"" floor to proceed. More trouble...Best thing about this hotel? The staff are wonderful. Necole needs to manage the hotel, not just be one of their workers.Worst thing? The technology is so cool that you can't do anything simply. This hotel needs to remember K.I.S.S.

The hotel is just a luxurious hotel, the reception at the 34th floor overlooking Central Park, the hotel is near the trendy Time Warner centre at Columbus Circle. The rooms are rated according to view (Hudson river or Central Park) and space, although the difference in space is not spectacular (never had the pleasure of staying in a suite so cannot comment on that) . The better views are the ones that overlook Central Park (although the ugly tall Trump Towers hotel unfortunately figures as a “black” spot taking away some of the views). The rooms are not very spacious (what can you expect in New York?) but some rooms have a nice long bathroom with bath and shower. Overall the rooms are absolutely not spectacular, neither in design (most of them rather outdated) nor in space or outfit. One need to explore the different rooms carefully and not take whatever first room one is put in. One of my earlier stays I was in a room opposite a service room, where personnel came in and out making quite a noise hitting the doors with their in room dining cars.The restaurant and breakfast room has superb views on Central Park. The concierge is very helpful and well connected. The beds are comfortable, the in room entertainment is well organized with a wide selection of Radio, TV, movies and equipment for your mp3 player. The hotel car can bring you in a classy Bentley to anywhere in the city in a circle of a few miles. The spa however is rather disappointing, took a massage but the masseuse was not what you can expect from a 5 star hotel. Overall my impression is that, although comfortable and luxurious, it’s not at all top notch in a city like NY where you would expect the sort of super luxurious hotels you get nowadays in world cities around the globe.

My big disappointment was breakfast room service. Room service just could not get the order right, even though I ordered only things that were on the menu. Even lunch room service was not right. I checked out one day early as I just was not looking forward to another breakfast being botched. Also, when all I wanted to do is report the error, room service insisted on sending a manager to talk to me. It told them no that I was busy, which I was. They would not listen to me and sent a manager anyhow. I could not believe how much emphasis room service put on not giving me what I requested and only giving me what they decided was good enough for me to have. Although the mall is convenient by accessing it from the third floor via a hallway, I also believe this is a security risk for the hotel. There are no live eyes that can see this hallway. The fitness area is pleasant with the light from the windows. Swimming int he lap pool was excellent. Windows on three sides is quite pleasant. The location is too far of a walk from Fifth Avenue to my liking. Others may like it being near Time Warner. I paid over $2,600 for two nights. I would have to rating this a five star with all five star rating to say that it was worth the money.","Cockeysville, Maryland","9Adventuress</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cockeysville, Maryland</strong>",49,3.0

The room was dark and although I had paid for a view of Central park, it was a corridor view. The bathroom was entirely substandard- far to tiny for one person, let alone 2. AND there was a curtain rod in the middle of the bed when we arrived. The gym and pool were tiny and there were disgruntled guests in the foyer waiting to be shown to the nearest Equinox. I don't judge a hotel on its restaurants as one can make reservations to eat at any restaurant regardless of where one is staying. We have stayed in many famous five star hotels around the world and this Mandarin Oriental just does not even come close to the standard offered in the other establishments we have been to. If I can save one traveller from staying here, then my review will have been worthwhile.

I'm also aware of the high quality service provided in London. The NYC MO still has some work to do on the service front. There were some issues with my room being ready and poor service at the front desk and lobby. However, these items were rectified and an apology and upgrade were forthcoming. This is a mark of a truly world class hotel - being able to rectify problems and satisfy their customers' demands. The suite upgrade had amazing views of Central Park and the Hudson River - I did not feel like leaving the hotel. The restaurant Asiate is expensive but worth every penny - try their degustation menu for an absolutely superb meal of a lifetime. I am sure this hotel will go from strength to strength - just a few polishes needed for the MO's trademark service. This is the hotel to stay in NYC and certainly better than Library Hotel (TA no#1) - although Library Hotel does have flawless service.","London, United Kingdom","Londoner016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",262,5.0

Inside the drama continues. Stepping out of the lift into the spectacular 35th floor lobby with its view over Central Park, the Mandarin is immediately set apart.Unlike other top hotels, where you can end up looking at a non-descript side street or even an internal light well, every room in the Mandarin has those dramatic views, leaving you in no doubt that you are in NYC. Even the standard rooms have terrific cityscapes, views of the park or the Hudson River. And all the rooms are big - especially for New York. The interior design - at least the colour scheme - is not my favourite, but it is striking and all the elements, furniture, bedding etc. are very comfortable, chic and high quality. The spa treatments are first class and the facilities - hot pool, steam room, terrific swimming pool overlooking the city - are comprehensive.Food etc. - Breakfast fine, again with that tremendous view. In the evening Asiate is one of the most sophisticated fusion restaurants in town. Lobby bar good place for dim sum and asian tapas.Location - I like it. Right by the park and a stroll across to 5th Avenue to Bergdorf and FAO Schwarz - all the family presents you need.I am a big fan of Mandarin Oriental service in general and the New York hotel measures up very well.Minor gripe: If there is a conference or event it definitely impinges on the hotel. On my last visit there was a wedding and the music was pounding down into the lobby from the floor above. Some conferences occupy the corridor to the Swimming pool, so you may find yourself wandering through internet geeks in your towelling robe.I think it's pretty obvious that this is now New York's best hotel - as is confirmed by the now stratospheric room rates.","London, United Kingdom","Jafarcakes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",57,5.0

We have been to New York twice before and gone shopping in the Time Warner Center, so we knew that it was an excellent location and we weren’t disappointed. We stayed in a Premier Central Park View room on the 47th floor and had excellent views of the park and mid-town. My partner had advised the hotel that it was our honeymoon and so we were upgraded slightly from a Central Park View Room (to Premier). Unfortunately, there was nothing in the room when we got there and I initially felt disappointed. My partner admitted that he had ordered chocolates and champagne, which were supposed to be in the room but had been forgotten about by the hotel. So he had to phone them and someone brought them to us. The hotel also gave us a chocolate mousse that said ‘Congratulations’ on it, which we enjoyed. My partner had also requested that a welcome card have my married name on it, as it would be the first time that I would see it written down – unfortunately, the welcome card only had his name on it. So it wasn’t the best of starts at the hotel, however we tried to console ourselves that we had received a room upgrade.The room was trendy with black and red décor and the bed was comfortable. We were disappointed that we weren’t staying for longer than two days, as we really enjoyed staying here. We had breakfast at the hotel on our second morning. The views were even better from the restaurant, as we were seated at a table at a corner window. The staff were very friendly and provided good service and the breakfast was excellent. We were given a complimentary smoothie of the day (which I love!) then we ordered coffee, bagels with cream cheese and fruit salad. It was not a breakfast buffet, but then I prefer it that way as it is easier on the waistline. Our waiter happily spoke away to us about Hawaii and recommended things that we should do when we are there. He also took a few excellent photos of us. Another staff-member offered to take a photo of us in the reception area as we were checking out – very helpful.Overall, we had an excellent stay here and would stay here again.","Fife, Scotland","Travel-Diva-KD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fife, Scotland</strong>",33,5.0

Our suite on the 47th floor was everything we expected it to be, a large, modern, very comfortable set of rooms, and what breathtaking views over New York. It had a surprisingly large bathroom, something rare for New York hotels. Each room was very well equipped with every modern convenience.The Spa was the best yet, we booked the VIP Suite, very expensive, but worth every dollar. Cheryl and Samantha looked after us, we actually felt like VIP's and at no stage did the experience feel anything but relaxing. In fact we left out so relaxed we had to go have a siesta.Service in the Bar, Restaurant and Lounge was efficient, friendly and very professional. Special thanks must go to Frank who among all the staff who looked after us in the Lounge, went that little bit further to make our stay special. We must also express our heartfelt thanks to Shyanne, the Bar/ Lounge Manageress, she went out of her way, to the point of even keeping the kitchen open late one evening, as we wanted to eat in the Lounge after seeing a Broadway show, a true credit to the Mandarin Oriental.The concierge always seemed to know what we wanted, before we had even asked. As we had booked our holiday through Elegant Resorts back in the UK, we have pre-paid for our transfers from the Airport to the Hotel however, when we were checking our bill, via the TV, we noticed that we had been billed. When we queried this with the Concierge it was dealt with in a professional and efficient manner.Credit must also go to the all in Housekeeping. When ever we returned to our room after a day sightseeing, or after dinner in the evening, it was always refreshed, clean towels, toiletries laid out in the bathroom, it was a pleasure to come back to. All in all I would give the hotel 7 stars for its location, attention to detail, the service of its entire staff and for making what was a birthday trip to New York, one to remember for a very long time.We have booked into the Mandarin Oriental in Prague from April 28 and cannot wait to enjoy the service all over again.We are definitely A FAN","Edge, United Kingdom","Kevin B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edge, United Kingdom</strong>",93,5.0

Guest bathroom, excellent shower and plenty of closet and storage space. Wi-Fi with decent speeds in both suite and throughout hotel. I felt that more door people were required at the entrance. It was mostly the same guy: tired, over heated and run down and this is not quite what you expect from the MO. He was very friendly, however if you’ve stayed at other destinations of this chain then you’ll know what a welcoming should be.Guest relations forgot my wife’s birthday and, though professional, the concierge staff only really started becoming proactive to the level you would expect once I started providing some fiscal inspiration for requests. I felt that the QoS which tipping acquired in New York was in line with what you obtained prior to adding a thank you tip in other hotels.Airport pickup was efficient and quick and were from plan to car in 15 mins, incl. luggage collection. We sorely missed an in-suite check-in which is almost standard at this standard nor did they escort you to the room to give a quick guide as to what’s where, etc. Very much liked the complementary use of hotel car services for short trips.Asiante was a breath of fresh air and thoroughly enjoyable with new and exciting variations and interpretations on some classic dishes. Prices were as you would expect in the 2-300$USD per meal for 2 with a lower end bottle. The only let down here was that the last sitting for lunch was at 13:45 and then no worthwhile dining options in between. So if you miss the slot, the quality of dining options drops dramatically. Great view in the Lobby bar though.The difference in service quality, personalised attention and uniqueness/exclusivity of stay between, say, Singapore and New York is vast with Singapore and even the likes of Kuala Lumpur a long way ahead.Everything said, all the above should be taken with a pinch of salt. Expectations differ from party to party and through my experience it’s unfair to perhaps compare service in one region (e.g. Asia to America) to that of another and attitudes of employees and what is considered the norm differ dramatically. So this is, by NYC standards, an efficient and highly presentable hotel with stunning views, decent suites and a flagship restaurant.Well worth a try.","Riga, Latvia","Irishlatino</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Riga, Latvia</strong>",26,4.0

Great first impression as the man who helped us check in was very welcoming and upgraded us to a room with a view of Central Park. The room was stunning, very quiet, and very comfortable. I was, however, taken aback by the strong scent in the hallways. The first time I smelled it, I thought it was a guest with strong aftershave, but then I realized that the hallways on every floor had the same scent. It was strong enough to exacerbate my allergies. Luckily the room didn't have the same smell. When I mentioned it by phone to the assistant manager and later to the person at the desk at check-out, while I did receive a verbal apology from the desk manager, they treated me like I was crazy and denied that there is a scent in the hallways. My husband also noticed it. Apparently no other guests had complained. I can still remember the smell a day later back at home and am sad to have a negative association with what is otherwise a lovely hotel. I was surprised that the desk manager only gave me his card and offerred to have me call in advance of my next stay so they could ""neutralize"" the scent before we arrive. If they really valued my return business, they would have made some kind of token reduction on our bill or better yet for them business-wise, would have offerred us a discount or credit towards food or spa services on our next stay. I left with the impression that they weren't interested in our return business and since NYC has so many luxury hotels, I don't plan on returning to the Mandarin Oriental. Also, I was surprised that they charge for wireless internet, which I don't expect at top hotels.","Tulsa, Oklahoma","travelerdocmom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma</strong>",15,4.0

We satyed in a Premier Central Park View Room. The view was spectacular, the location was very convenient, close to everything. Room was ok, nothing spectacular for the price (except as noted the view and the location). The bathroom was large and luxurious however.One bad experience spoiled our trip. Upon returning to our room late one evening (after 1 am), we found that although our key card opened the room, the dead bolt on the inside was thrown! I have no idea how that could have happened, I thought you needed to be in the room to move that into place. We called the front desk who promptly sent someone up to assist. I was somewhat annoyed because at first they were very insistant that we had the wrong room (I am sure at this late hour, and we had been at a bar, this does happen quite often) but if it was the wrong room why was the key card working? They were also asking how we could have engaged the dead bolt, as though it was our fault. They called for several more maintenance people to come and help. After standing in the hallway for close to half an hour, it is approaching 2 am by now, we went down to the front desk. About the same time we arrived at the front desk, they received a call that they had been successful in gaining entry into the room.Upon returning to the room, we discovered that they had managed to snap the dead bolt fixture. This was never repaired for the remainder of our stay. It also was obvious that evening turndown service had been the last ones in the room (so it was not us that caused this), management promised us a key card investigation as to who the last person to enter the room had been. We never heard anything more on the subject.My gripe is that being inconvienienced by standing in the hallway for over half an hour in the middle of the night due to a mistake on the part of the housekeeping staff (I still have no idea how they locked it) we received no further apology from the hotel. For the price we paid for the room, a complimentary breakfast, drink, discount or something would have been appreciated.

Spent about twice the daily rate I am used to at other nice NY hotels, but wanted to treat myself to something special. So was it worth it? Yes, I think so. Would I stay there again? Probably not, just too expensive to do again. Having said that, I really can't say anything negative about the Mandarin Oriental. The location in the Time-Warner complex is excellent. The main entrance is on the street level but you have to take a high speed elevator to the 35th floor for registration, restaurant, and bar. Then you take another bank of elevators to the rooms above the 35th. Sounds like a lot of trouble, but it's really not with the high speed elevators. Another really nice feature is that the hotel elevators stop on the third floor of the shopping/dining complex so you really don't have to leave the hotel area at all to access several great restaurants and upscale shops. I can recommend the LandMarc and the Porter House restaurants in the dining area. My room on the 49th floor had an amazing view of the Hudson River and NY skyline. For a deluxe king I found the room somewhat small, but very clean and modern with a great bathroom with separate rain shower as well as a soaking tub. Believe it or not, the soaking tub actually has a small window that you can look out of while bathing. Of course, the furnishings, bed and linens, electronics, etc. were all first-rate as expected. I had room service two nights which was also excellent and well-presented. Did not use the pool or spa so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I certainly can highly recommend this property, but I can't imagine staying there regularly unless I win the lottery.","Minneapolis, Mn.","Trekman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Mn.</strong>",37,5.0

Especially the views on the Central Park are amazing and the hotel product is still new.However, not just because of the management by MO but also due to image of the hotel had been dissapointed by our stay. The rooms has been nice with sound system for your ipod and books for bedside reading. And the view has been more than great. But the bathroom has been a joke for a new built hotel. It has been too small, not well designed and sparely equipped with amenities (e.g. just one bath gel and shampoo for bath tub/ shower).The pool area and the gym reminded us on a community swimming pool. No space for sun chairs, the sauna has been right in the pool area, no changing rooms nor relaxation areas. It made the impression that they just built a pool to have it on the checklist.Next critical service has been the business centre: they just converted a suite/ room into the business centre by palcing some desks/ PC's in an empty room. No atmosphere which nevertheless will be charged with 25$ for use.Contrariwise the restaurant Asiate serves excellent food as well as a great atmosphere for breakfast. Definitely a place to spend an evening in style with great service and food. Thanks to the different levels nearly all tables having the same great view on the Central Park and NYC.Overall we just missed the small things which separates a deluxe hotel from a regular five star hotel.

We stayed in a very spacious suite and paid approximately $1,200/night. I mention the price because I was totally shocked that they would charge me for daily Internet use (I believe it was $19.99/day). So I shell out $1,200 a night for the hotel and then they ask for $19.99? This makes me crazy! What could have been an almost perfect stay at the Mandarin turned into Mandarin management: we live in a new world. The Internet is almost as important as water. To be frank, I would rather be charged for water or electricity use than for the Internet. This may sound exaggerated but it really isn't that far from reality. The Mandarin needs to be ahead of the curve if they want to maintain their pristine reputation. I can understand why many of the marginal hotel chains still charge for the Internet - I still think it is short sighted but it is understandable as they aren't able to charge a high room rate like the Mandarin. Take a look at budget hotels such as Comfort Suites, they are not charging for Internet and in my opinion, it really adds to the experience (wow is Comfort Suites beating the Mandarin in an important customer service area?) Charge me $1,219.99 for your room but don't charge me $1,200 and an Internet fee. Be progressive, stay ahead of the curve.

FABULOUS. Our suite had a killer view of the Hudson. What really made our weekend was the attention to detail, nothing was overlooked. We made a reservation for dinner at Asiate and while my S.O. was getting ready, I went down to the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. The bar was busy but I was quickly taken care of quickly and when a seat opened, my drink was moved and some snacks appeared. That is definately not what I have experienced in other Hotel bars and it really set the tone for a great evening. Next we went to Asiate and they had a Valentines tasting dinner tha was superb. She ordered the champagne pairing and I ordered the wine paring, I usually have difficulty remembering the pairings and don't like the blackberry thing at dinner, I asked for a pen and pad and was surprised that when the waiter brought it, they read my mind and produced the pairings already typed out, now that is service. The food was excellent, the Kobe beef trio is not to be missed and the desert was fabulous as well. I will definately say that the true high point was sleeping in on Valentines morning (the sheets were great) and ordering room service for 11am. It arrived prescisly at 11 and it was presented with great joy by our waiter. There was even a little surprise of a blueberry smoothie...The difference here is the staff, they really make you feel like a VIP.All in all a wonderful weekend and we look forward to next time",lovetotravel1,"lovetotravel1_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>lovetotravel1</strong>",12,5.0

It's everything an uber-expensive five star city hotel should be. You can't beat the location -- perfectly placed at the southwest corner of Central Park with fabulous views from its Lobby Lounge bar; you're walking distance to all of the top notch shopping and a whole list of sites. The service is impeccable; anything you could want is proactively offered to you --- from the valet to the bellmen, to the concierge to the spa staff to the lobby lounge staff.....they make you feel like royalty.We had room 4724 (a non-suite room), which had a decent view of the Hudson River. The room was fairly small, but they used the space brilliantly. The marble bathroom with two sinks, rain shower head and separate tub was very large (in a good way). The linens were top notch; and the plasma TV offered a live user friendly TV guide. The room also had a spacious walk-in closet.The spa is one of the most expensive around, but the massages are always extremely good. As soon as you have a room reservation, I highly recommend making a reservation for lunch or afternoon/evening cocktails in the Lobby Lounge that overlooks Central Park. Guests get priority over non-guests, but it's always a good idea to have a reservation to ensure the best available table/view.NB: We phoned the hotel directly and simply asked if they were offering any specials not reflected on the website. They ended up offering us free valet parking, free breakfast and a two category room upgrade -- all just for asking the question (the complimentary room service breakfast was amazing; I requested a To-Go cup for my coffee and the lid was a non-spill lid...just one more small detail they didn't overlook).Amazing hotel; extraordinary staff.

The bedroom sits behind the living room and offers really good views as well. The suite also provides one and a half bathrooms - a nice touch. When the staff member brought us up, after showing us around, he asked if we would like some complimentary coffee, tea, etc. We decided it would be nice for some coffee, and within ten minutes coffee was in our room.

I like the chain in general and have stayed at their hotels in Miami and Washington DC, but this one is my favorite. It is consistently wonderful and to me epitomizes New York chic (in an Asian kinda way). The design is impeccable. I've stayed in both single rooms and suites. Both are terrific--the suites being particularly terrific, of course. And I like how the rooms are high up (the hotel begins on the 39 floor of one of the towers in the Time Warner Center), thus blocking out all the noise and craziness of The City.The room service menu is excellent. I have also eaten at their restaurant Asiate which is very nice. I like the Lobby Lounge less well, as it tends to be a bit of a scene. But the food is very good and the city views are spectacular. Usually when we stay here, we are with our three young children, so the giant Whole Foods food court in the basement of the building is a real plus. So convenient.The service at this hotel is phenomenal. They really go the extra mile. And the concierge desk sets the gold standard. Those folks really know New York and understand their clientele. I have always found their advice and recommendations to be spot on. Last of all, I will say that you really get to know a hotel when something goes wrong. One time when I was staying here, I left my purse on the floor of a taxi cab. We were leaving the next day and I was justifiably in a panic. I rushed down to the concierge desk at 11:30p and told them what happened. They totally took care of me. The security guy on duty was actually an off-duty cop. He gave me phenomenal advice on stopping my credit cards, etc. Then they drove me down to the police precinct so I could fill out the stolen goods forms. (At the time, I did not know whether the purse was missing or stolen.) As it turned out, a kind gentleman found my purse, tracked me down and returned it before I left town. But I ever so impressed by the hotel's response. In fact, their head of security phoned me at home a few days later to follow up and make sure everything was okay.",Virginia,"Kirkberta</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia</strong>",72,5.0

Like most NYC 5-star establishments it’s incredibly expensive and not great value for money. On the plus side, staff here is right on top of the game and could not be faulted on service delivery. Our room on the 54th (top) floor had spectacular views of the Hudson, was comfortable and of a good size but not without its flaws. The worst of these was lighting at night – with all the lights on it was still too dark to read anywhere except in bed or at the desk (not helped by one of the over-bed down-lights being blown and the “night light” not functioning). A cosy chaise lounge by the window was the perfect place for reading but a black hole without a lamp. The single vanity in an otherwise good bathroom was also a disappointment, lacking space to spread a couple’s toiletries around. Nothing to complain about in a lesser hotel, but when you’re paying this much money? On our visit, the hotel’s Asiate restaurant was closed for renovation so breakfast was served in the Lobby Lounge. Great views over Central Park West to the Upper East Side did not compensate for a completely drab and uninspiring à la carte menu – oatmeal that could have been pre-made and pastries served stone cold and so floury they made you gag. (Check out the Greenwich Hotel for how breakfast should be done). Such a pity the warm and engaging service was let down by the kitchen. While the front desk and concierge could not have been more helpful in their duties, the Spa remained unexplored due to extortionate charges. $305 for a 1hour 50 minute massage? Give us a break! Nice pool though. This well-located hotel works fine for an uptown stay but we’d be inclined to try the newly renovated Pierre or Mark hotels next time.

It is quite expensive and 2. Everything, for us, in the hotel was pretty much perfect. It has the most fantastic location - just beside Central Park. If you like running (or just walking), you'll love it here! We ran every day before breakfast. When you come back in to the hotel after your run they have water and bananas out for the runners (depending on what time you get back of course - we missed it one day) and we thought that was a great idea. Although you would argue that when you are paying over $1000 per night for the room the least they can do is give you a banana and a bottle of water when you get back in from your run! The hotel also has a lovely swimming pool - it's about 25m - and a gym. Across the road is a 24 hour Starbucks (we're from London where you don't get that so much! So when you wake up at 5am you can get your coffee which is great. I have no doubt that you can order coffee through room service at any time but I didn’t find their coffee quite strong enough in the morning hence my Starbucks visit instead).Breakfast in the hotel is expensive but good. We had an $80 credit every day for breakfast and we used that easily at breakfast and we weren’t trying the whole menu! Our bedroom was wonderful – we had a Central Park room – it had a massive bed and lovely bathroom. I have no idea what the other rooms are like so I can only recommend this one – the views are incredible.We used the spa too – again it’s expensive but good.

I think we got it. I wasn't 100% happy because I've stayed at a Mandarin Oriental before (in Hong Kong), and the service and quality of room just weren't as great as the HK experience. Whilst I can accept that the different locations can explain the different amenities, an international brand like the Mandarin Oriental should really have the same level of excellent service globally.Gripe out of the way, the experience was amazing. I don't think you could ask for a better view of New York City than from the Mandarin Oriental - it was just like in the magazines and in the movies. We were on the 49th floor and had a great view of Central Park and the skyscrapers in the south easterly direction. The room was very comfortable (if a bit small, but I hear that's the norm). The bathroom felt like it could have been spruced up a bit. The concierge service was a bit hit and miss. But they tried very hard and were genuinely friendly people. Reception/front desk, however, were not very friendly and pretty snooty.The location was also great for everything - shopping (Niketown, Bloomingdales, etc. all a short walk away), theatres (about 15 minutes in a taxi) and most of all restaurants. Jean Georges is just across the road in the Trump Tower and Per Se is in the same building. The hotel is located above a shopping mall, which had some places that I was looking for (e.g., J Crew).Breakfast in the restaurant was pretty excellent, with amazing views, of course. Some city types seem to have breakfast meetings there, which adds to the atmosphere.All in all, a good place to have stayed. Yes, it was expensive, but I don't think there's any other way in NYC.","London, England","Traveling_Lotus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",40,4.0

The rooms were very spacious with high ceilings, a huge bathroom, floor to ceiling windows and amazing views. The king bed was massive and like sleeping on a cloud. I couldn't find fault with a single thing in the room. If I were being REALLY picky I would say that the only thing I didn't like was that you couldn't get the same channels on the television in the bathroom that you could on the TV in the bedroom. That's it. Really.After a mad day of meetings and running around New York in heels and humidity, I was so ready to shower and relax. The bathroom did not disappoint. Great bath amenities, huge rain shower head, big soft towels and a luxurious robe. Most welcome to my tired feet were the soft slippers. Ahhh. Just as I was debating whether to spoil my upcoming dinner at Asiate by eating something out of the mini-bar (I was ravenous) I hear my door bell ring and someone say ""In room dining, good afternoon?"" I don't know how, but they read my mind. The Mandarin had sent up a complimentary bento box with truffles, biscotti, mini-cookies and various other treats-- just enough to tide me over until dinner. Dinner at Asiate was out of this world. I told the waiter that I was vegetarian, and they were incredibly accommodating. They made sure to ask if I ate fish, poultry, dairy, eggs-- they made it a perfect dining experience. The food was out of this world. The risotto was spectacular, the drinks were delightfully strong and the desserts were nothing short of sinful. Couple that with spectacular views of Central Park (and the city lights, when it got dark) and you have a dinner that I won't soon forget.One of the things at the Mandarin that really impressed me was the service. Being a five star hotel, of course I expected a certain level of service. However, what impressed me was not the level of service, but the warmth of it. The gentleman who checked us in (Thomas? the name escapes me) was so very personable and warm. You really got the feeling that he enjoyed his job and was truly pleased to be welcoming you to his hotel. Any employee I came across had a genuine smile for me and a greeting. I stayed at a number of different hotels during my week in New York, and the service at the Mandarin was hands-down the most personable, which surprised me.","Winnipeg, Manitoba","RunCatchKiss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Manitoba</strong>",53,5.0

Some are a little dated, but very well maintained.The hotel has all amenities of a truly 5 star hotel with the service that goes with it. Both restaurants are very good, you can have a light bite at the bar area or a proper dining experience at their michelin star restaurant, both displaying incredible views over the city.The spa is great, large choice of treatments, and has a jaccuzzi/sauna/steam room. The pool is a good 20m long if not more and the gym is excellent filled with modern equipment.Finally, the business center is open all night and has everything you need which is helpful and saved me a few times.This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Price is aligned with the hotel category, but definitely not a rip-off, they earn every cent they charge you for.The only negative is the area if you're coming on a leisure trip. I've also stayed downtown which is a more pleasant neighbourhood. It's not bad per se (you have the park, museums, shopping etc) but most people around the hotel are there to work, and I felt that the scene doesn't give you the feeling of what living in New York is like.

The Mandarin is a great location... On Central Park, Near Midtown, but not as crazy as Times Square. I did a mixed business and leisure trip here for 3 days. Hotel service was superb. Asiate restaurant is tops in the entire City according to Zagat for best views and decor... and it is. Here are some more highlights:* Rooms: Grade: A... Nice, newer, great bathrooms. Had a Hudson River view, Central Park is nicer, but Hudson View from corner rooms was great for us. Surprisingly, our upgraded corner room did not have two sinks in bathroom. If important to you, be sure to ask. Shower was great. I've had NYC rooms that were the size of a coat closet, the king room here was very comfortable. * Mini-Bar: A. In NY, if you want a Diet Coke or a quick snack, I do not know how people survive without a nice mini-bar. They had a great mini-bar with water and drinks. Expensive, yes, BUT THIS IS NY! Many hotels are removing mini-bars, but they are a salvation if you want a Diet Coke or Snack at an odd time.* Spa: A++... Definitely one of the best urban spas anywhere. Great hot tub/pool, steam room, etc. Not cheap, but worth every penny for a massage or other service.* Lobby: A... On the 35th floor, nice lounge area, clean and open space. Good lobby bar with great views. * Concierge: A... arranged all kinds of stuff for us. Friendly and efficient.* Room Service: A-... Generally great. Food and service were excellent. * Asiate: A... Great food, the best view around. Brunch was VERY reasonable. Good wines too. * Lobby Bar food: B+... A friend of mine ate lunch at the lobby bar. He said most of it was good, but some items got cold. Lobby bar is next to Asiate, but they probably do not share a kitchen. His sense was this food came from a kitchen much further and not Asiate. His review of the lukewarm food was the only real criticism we could find at this hotel. * Location: A+... one of the best. * Service: A... great overall. Not over the top, there when you need them. Front desk was busy sometimes, but overall they seem to have a good full staff everywhere. Doorman and concierge helped solve lots of issues. * Other: A+... Hotels are expensive. If you are busy, you need lots of little things taken car of... they had a hotel shuttle take us to a play when we were rushed and booked a great ride to the airport in an Audi A8. Can't say enough about the small stuff. This hotel had a LOT of international guests from Europe and Asia. There were a few groups of loud young twentysomethings on some sort of group party who made a bit of noise, but otherwise this is a great, quiet, professional-focused hotel. Great business hotel and a great leisure hotel if you want to be near Central Park and/or have a great spa. We will return to this hotel again soon.

The experience offered by the Mandarin Oriental has topped all the vacations that we have ever taken. The staff was genuinely friendly and exceptional to service. The views from our room and lobby of the Hudson River and Central Park were spectacular. The hotel is located within an easy and entertaining walking distance to everything Manhattan. The subway entrance is just off the corner in Columbus Circle. The entry to the hotel was also very pleasing as it away from the hustle and bustle of Columbus Circle and the many hotels on Broadway, Park and 5th Avenue venues. From the door-staff to direct you to the elevators for the 35th floor lobby, to the reception/check-in, room service, privacy service; everything about this hotel was geared to great and sincere personal service. Prior to booking, I read a few reviews complaining of the noisy Hudson River side of the hotel. We requested the Hudson River side for the views and found no disturbing noise whatsoever, and our room was directly across from the ice-machine and service elevator room. We were on the 51st floor and could hear a faint siren squawk every now and then, but then we were in the largest city in the U.S; I hear more sirens living in Dallas, TX. And, let me mention that we slept like babies; the bed and linens are luxurious, the hairdryer was a real one and not attached to the wall, the spa soaps and lotions divine - I'm very picky/sensitive skin and usually don't bother with these complimentary items, but put some on my tired feet and immediately notice the high quality of the products. Also, superior compliments to room service; we found ourselves in our room each late afternoon to rest and rejuvenate before going back out again in the evening; every afternoon a plate or basket of delicious snacks were waiting our arrival (nuts, garnished popcorn, candied fruits, fresh fruits, chocolates, etc.) - a nice touch to go with our cocktail, which I ordered through room service every late afternoon and here is the point - it arrived quickly, not 30 minutes after ordering, but within minutes. Same with our breakfast room service that we did not pre-order the night before. Room Service within minutes with fine linens, cutlery and china. The coffee, Illy, is one of my favorites.

On the positive side, we found the staff very friendly and helpful (especially the concierge) and the room on the Central Park side was very quiet.

If you've been to the Fat Duck or similar in Europe this restaurant will be a disappointment. It has the NY tendency (just like its neighbour Per Se) to be over elaborate in the preparation of food without really achieving anything remarkable. And at present they are all obsessed with the provenance of the ingredients - I don't really care where the mushroom comes from or how it is grown if it tastes bland....The next day I couldnt remember what I'd eaten at all.

Luxury hotels tend to feel stuffy and old, whereas the Mandarin Oriental was modern, and warm. The Asian influence is everywhere, but always tasteful and never overdone. What I liked most about the hotel and the suite was how comfortable I felt everywhere. From check-in to check-out, I was always made to feel like a king.The 35th Floor Lobby is exquisite. The Front Desk staff was friendly, accommodating, and genuine. There was nothing scripted or fake about anyone I came in contact with (something I find to be obnoxious at other hotels). The one bedroom, one and half bathroom suite was stunning. The bedroom was exceptionally large and the 2 closets were impressively spacious. Next to the large picture window was a beautiful chaise. The bed was very comfortable and when we asked for non-down bedding, it was brought in an instant. The main bathroom was humongous! It was as long as the room. I loved how it flanked the bed (there was a door on each side of the bed). The rain showerhead and “Fresh” products were lovely as was the soaking tub, his and her sinks, and swiveling TV.I’ve lived in New York City all my life, but standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, on the 53rd floor, with unbelievable views of the Hudson River, Central Park, and Columbus Circle renewed my love for this city – I could only imagine how awed out-of-towners must be.Dinner at Asiate was an event. We sat at one of the window seats overlooking the park and had a beautiful view as we ate our impressive dinner. This restaurant deserves much more attention than it receives. The service was impeccable and the food was out of this world (I’m still dreaming about the lobster and risotto dishes). The Lobby Lounge was equally as impressive, but obviously with a more casual feel. I’ll always be apprehensive about paying more than $15 for a cocktail, but that apprehension disappeared after the first sip of my beautifully crafted “Baby Buddha”.Overall, I think Mandarin Oriental is the best hotel in New York. It’s different. In a very, very good way.","Chicago, Illinois","David J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",36,5.0

We booked on the Internet Rate and paid $815 dollars/night plus taxes. On arrival the receptionist upgraded us from a Grand Deluxe Double room on the 40th floor (their website says these rooms are on floors 43-54 so not sure if she was downgrading us!) to a Premier Hudson River View room on the 53rd floor. Our room was amazing, exactly as the pictures depict on their website, spotlessly clean, well appointed and with fantastic views of the city and the River Hudson. The bed was super comfy. Excellent sound system, didn’t really use the TV so can’t comment on choice of channels. We’d only been in our room 30 minutes when complimentary champagne and chocolate cake arrived, both were delicious. Housekeeping and turndown service was excellent. We ordered room service a couple of times and it was exceptional. Breakfast in our room was more than adequate but didn’t think it was up to the usual Mandarin standard. We didn’t have much need to use the concierge but when we did they were very helpful and efficient. The bellmen/doormen were all very friendly. We didn’t have time to eat in Asiate but wish we had. We had cocktails and mini burgers (not together!) in the Lobby Lounge, the burgers were great. Hotel location was excellent for us, in a quietish area on the edge of central park but only about a 10 minute walk to Times Square.

The park views were terrific. The service was friendly. But the overall experience feels more like a convention Hyatt. There's nothing wrong with that, but its very dissapointing if you are expecting a five star experience. That fifth star is all in the details, and thats what the hotel lacks. From the service, to the finishes in the rooms. Most of the problems come from the building itself. Even though the hotel is only a couple hundred rooms, you definitely feel like you're in a massive structure. And everything, from the spa to the business center feels like its miles away, down random corridors. For example, the entrance to the gym is located just outside a ballroom area: so at best, you have to walk through a dark empty banquet area with a piano covered in the corner, but I couldn't help thinking of the alternative if the room were in use, which would be making your way through a black tie affair in your sweaty workout clothes. One afternoon I returned to my room to find the maid cleaning the room, but noticed she had the TV turned on and was watching a soap opera. Little things like this give the impression there is very little oversight of the smaller details by management. The area rug in the lobby has an ugly rubber band around it like an airport would have, and the tile and fixtures in the bathrooms, while attractive, look cheap and institutional. The rooms have an office-chic feel to them, like a first class airport lounge. Nothing wrong with that, but certainly not the height of luxury one might expect.",CA,"JTG61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>CA</strong>",14,3.0

Yes you are closer to the theatres and you have shopping & dining options downstairs (the hotel is on the higher levels of a Columbus Circle building) but its a stroll to 5th & a stroll back with shopping bags.

Several times when I called housekeeping to ask for something to be delivered or done in the room, they forget or made a mistake and brought the wrong things.

Prior to staying at the MO we had already stayed 6 nights in NYC in a mid priced hotel around the corner so this was our treat. To be honest I was a bit dissapointed. Yes the room was overlooking central park but a good proportion of the view was obliterated by the Trump tower which has been built right in front of the Times Warner centre (where the MO is housed on the top floors). We had also already seen the view of Central Park from the Top of the Rock so had already 'spoiled' it for ourselves - probably should have booked the room for our first and not last night in NYC. Room was nicely furnished but did not surpass any other 5 star property where you pay much less for a room. TV was infuriatingly difficult to operate if you wanted to browse the 100 or so channels. Breakfast at Asiate was divine - great service & food and highly recommended. Check in service helpful, efficient & friendly and as professional as you would expect for a hotel of this calibre.

Either I'm just hard to please or I had really bad luck with this experience. I booked a wkd trip with my mom in a suite - we were in town to see an oncologist for my mom. Having frequented many other hotels globally, luxury and otherwise, I was very disappointed. The door staff, who represent first and last impressions was terrible and didn't even come close to a mid-level hotel, let alone other 5-star hotels like a Four Seasons or a Ritz. On multiple occasions, they ignored us because they were too busy socializing with each other, doing blackberry(unbelievable!), or favoring other guests. We took many cabs and only once did we get assistance after we asked the doorman (this is after we tried hailing our own cab without any success right in front of him) - the doorman who was too busy doing his blackberry/phone and made us feel like we were rude for interrupting him. Doorman only held open door sometimes, seemed like only if he felt like it - it didn't matter if we had our luggage or not, it was very inconsistent. After being promised checkin to our room 30 min after we arrived, we took a 2 hr lunch and were surprised when they said that our room still was not ready when we returned - yes we were a few hours early but don't tell us it will be ready earlier if it won't be! This was not the welcome we needed especially due to my mom's fatigue. At least they treated us to a drink in the bar - but still all my mom wanted to do was rest. I was left on hold one night after asking concierge for some info - he forgot about me and I had to call back to get assistance from someone else. Upon leaving, we asked for an address and phone number to a Fifth Avenue store - the concierge gave us the wrong information (the address didn't exist and the number was for the corporate office, not the retail store). We ended up getting lost and I had to call my husband who was back home for navigation assistance - we ended up having to walk quite a distance to find the store (again, not good when my mother is ill) and had to rush our purchases before making it to the airport on time. If the conceirge could not find the info, he could have at least told us that rather than give us some bogus address on Fifth Avenue that did not even exist. The hotel did try to compensate for some of the bad service by not charging us for any balance of our breakfasts that our package did not include. But even that wasn't communicated very well and different messages were communicated by different people. I liked that the spa amenities were included in the suite rate - the steam room was good. But I've been to nicer spas. Location is good. The room was nice and I loved the bedside reading books and supply of Fiji water. The view from Asiate was beautiful. I was surprised that a newspaper was not included and the spa certificate was pretty much useless. I travel alot for business and have been to other hotels in NYC and I would not return to this hotel. This was my first Mandarin Oriental hotel stay - I had always preferred Peninsula for a luxury hotel with Asian flare. I didn't choose to stay there this time because their spa/gym was being renovated. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in this stay on many fronts.

The room itself was well laid out and had great views. I loved their rainshower head! I had a facial & a massage at the spa. Although it was very expensive (more than most places I've been), the services were excellent. I don't think I've had such a great massage in a very long time! We had dessert & coffee in their lobby bar one night. Not only were the desserts great, but the view (esp. at night) was great!The location is good. You could walk pretty much anywhere midtown. Anywhere else, you would need a cab. Also, since they had shops & restaurants right below the hotel (Shops at Columbus Circle), it was very convenient to grab coffee or snacks, or even a meal.All in all, this was a great hotel and I would definetely go back in a heartbeat.","Canton, MI","beach47</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canton, MI</strong>",110,5.0

My husband and I stayed there for a night after my grad school graduation and were completely blown away by the immaculate facilities, incredible location, and over-the-top friendly and attentive customer service. Each and every staff member you meet at the Mandarin Oriental have a genuine smile on their faces. The location of this hotel can NOT be beat for a visit to the city. I lived in New York City for three years, worked there for 5, and still hang out in the city several times a month. Columbus Circle, the Mandarin's location, is where you want to be if you are a tourist or a native New Yorker looking for an amazing stay. You are right at the hub of all the major subway lines, a short walk downtown to Times Square, 5th Ave Shopping, Museum of Modern Art, and a short walk uptown to Lincoln Center, Tavern on the Green, and the delicious restaurants of the Upper West Side. There is a bit less of the hustle and bustle of other midtown hotels located in the 30s and 40s (streets). Our room had the most spectacular view of central park and the upper west side - all rooms have views as the hotel lobby starts on the 35th floor.Go to the Mandarin if you can splurge!","Garwood, New Jersey","ekeat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Garwood, New Jersey</strong>",19,5.0

I enjoyed the decor and ambience of the Mandarin so much. Views were incredible. We were in a Hudson River view room and it was lovely. The washroom met and exceeded my expectations and this was my biggest concern after staying at the Four Seasons. Truly everything about the room was perfect and I cannot fault. From the cleaning, to turn down, I loved coming back to it and enjoyed being in it which is saying a lot for a hotel room. Public areas over the top in terms of decor and views. Service in the Lobby Lounge was awful as stated in previous reviews but you kind of let it go when you're just so happy to be there enjoying the view.It's a bit of a nuisance having to take two sets of elevators to get up to your room, but again you get over it - fast. The elevators are very efficient and smooth.We found the doormen, front desk, concierge staff all outstanding. We were offered rides in the hotel cars on a number of occasions.The spa was insanely expensive and I do mean insanely expensive, but the most luxurious spa I've ever been to - oddly the reception staff at the spa were not great in terms of service or competence. Would I do it again? No, I think I'd spend the four figures on dinner somewhere or a new handbag. Glad I tried it though.When booking the hotel and getting confirmations of same I was a little worried - things seemed somewhat unclear and disorganized, but when dealing directly with the hotel and concierge we were extremely happy on every level.My personal preference for location was the FS in terms of shopping on Madison etc., but if you enjoy the mall below the Mandarin then it would be the perfect place to stay - also it's very convenient to the subway if that is a priority. In summary, the FS washrooms are probably a bit better, but not by much, the room decor and ambience of the Mandarin was better in my opinion (not bigger - but better). Location is a personal preference. Service is almost as good as the FS, but as i said it's easy to overlook the shortcomings when you're happy on so many other levels. Give it a try!

The view of Central Park (room 4508) was great and the room was very nice. The bed was comfortable. Turn down service in the evening with bottle water is great. The service is impeccable. I loved the ""Do not Disturb"" or ""Make the room"" done by a push of a button, that was cool.while I like the bar and the lounge area, breakfast is just ok (food overall is tasteless...): no white bread (olive bread in the morning is a bit hard with orange jam; croissant a bit greasy...), no assam tea (the darjeeling is excellent though). For diner, the wine selection is impressive but food again, is nothing to brag about.Concierges were very helpful and their recommendations quite good. Now the not-so-good part:- Shower: the door was banging 3/4th of the way against the marble so was not really convenient to walk in; to make matter worst, the 'ceiling shower' is just at the entrance, so you get wet when you start it and if you want to get in, then it better be at the right temperature...- Noise: i was surprised to see that there was no ""second doors"" provided that the room was not too far from the elevator; but the bad part was that you could hear all the conversations in the hallway. Truly the only negative point.- Table by the window: I asked a table by the window for breakfast the first day since there was one available. I was told someone reserved it, eventhoug I insisted. I finished breakfast and no one ever showed up to the table. So much for treating well your guest. I guess next time, I would just go to front desk and ask them to ""solve the issue"".

We sprung for a Central Park-view room on the 45th floor, and it was the most amazing hotel view we've ever experienced (and at $1100 a night it should be). Our room view was even better than the view from the Lobby Lounge, so we ordered cocktails in the room one night and just relaxed on the backless sectional sofa that ran the entire width of our room right in front of the view. Total indulgence. True, the room was not overly large, but fine for NYC standards and elegantly decorated. My only minor complaint was the weird light switch in the bathroom: you had to hold it down for several seconds each time while the room gradually brightened or darkened. The Lobby Lounge is spectacular, with enormous windows overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park. To be safe you should make a reservation because it fills up and people linger. (The smaller bar off in the corner is cramped and has no view at all, so don't bother. ) The Lounge hostess, Christina, was extremely accommodating, and once we were able to get a table, she kept ""upgrading"" us to ones with better views as they became available, even though we hadn't asked. In all, the service was excellent. This hotel is part of the Time Warner building, and you can access the shopping area by taking the elevator down to the third floor.

He booked an upgraded room with a Central Park view--it was nearly $1000 for the night. We were prepared for the cost as we knew it would be that expensive.We arrived at noon and loved the beautiful interior of the hotel. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. Our room was ready, but the key system wasn't working so they walked us to the room. It was nice--not very large and has a view of Central Park that is ok--unfortunately it is largely obstructed by the awful Trump building, but that can't be helped. The room and amenities were really just ok--I think that most Westins, Ws, and even up-scale Marriotts were almost as nice. and Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, and others in that realm are easily comparable. There are some really nice a/v features, and the bathroom is much larger, but I don't think that the marginal difference in quality is even close to the difference in cost. And there were weird things about the bathroom--like no separate light switch or a fan in the little room that has the toilet, terribly slow hot water, not very soft or plush robes, and even really low quality ""q-tips"" (to be petty). Also, there is not a coffee maker in the room, so you are forced to order room service every time you want hot water for tea or coffee. And the prices for room service are just completely over the top. I guess they just figure that once you are paying that much for a room, a $27/pp (plus service fees) continental breakfast is no big expense. (And it goes up from there.)The worst part, however, is that we slept terribly! The pillows are so soft that you need at least two of them and there weren't extras in the room. The comforter is pretty and soft, but warmed up so much that we were roasting. And the air in the room was so incredibly dry that we really had trouble sleeping. We collectively got about 2 hours of sleep. We were pretty grumpy by morning.The service was very good--all very nice staff people. But the room just didn't live up to the price in any way, shape, or form. We'd have been just as happy at the W or a boutique hotel and would have spent $700 less.

First off, it's expensive...very expensive...and considering the Plaza is still closed it's claiming the honor of the Best Hotel In New York. And I guess it is an amazing hotel...the room (Deluxe Central Park View) was big (by NY standards) and well appointed, the bathroom was spacious and beautiful, but let's be clear: you're paying for a view. The windows are giant, and the view is spectacular (we were on the 45th floor). But, the Trump Tower and a new luxury apartment building do partly block your view of the park. The staff was very helpful, the concierge managed to work us into Masa downstairs at the last minute...but all in all, for the money (and the hype) I was expecting just a little more. They also charge for little things like internet access...which for the price I thought was annoying. Maybe I've been spoiled in the past.

Service was great again as was the room service. It's still extremely expensive but if you can afford it there's no reason to stay anywhere else.ps: The reason why I love mandarin's more than any other ultra lux chain? Because, as far as rooms go, what you see is what you get. There is never any mystery as far as how your room will look. Go on their website, every room as pictures and your room will look EXACTLY like the one you see on the website. In many older hotels every single room is decorated differently and you never know what your going to get, the mandarin is a refreshing exception.","orlando, Florida","buccsmf1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>orlando, Florida</strong>",78,5.0

When we came back to our room after exploring the city to our suprise we found the complimentary bottle of champagne and delicious chocolate cake waiting for us.The hotel is a favorite destination for celebrities (and apparently photographers who were hanging out in front of the entrance) so running into a Hollywood A-lister or the likes of Ryan Seacrest is somewhat of a usual thing.

Having stayed at the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton Central Park, Essex House and St. Regis before, I can objectively say that the MO has the best overall package.Incentives to stay:1) Modern and new, it is not frayed like the Ritz-Carlton and 4 Seasons and occupies a modern building without the creaks and sounds like at the Ritz-Carlton just down the road.2) The rooms are very spacious for central park hotels. Stayed in a standard room.3) All rooms have a view. Either Central Park or the Hudson. While many of the park views are partially blocked by the Trump, for the same price at the others I've mentioned above, frankly you'd be looking at the air well or another room's window.4) The concierge is excellent. They were friendly, on the ball and went out of their way. Only the 4 Seasons and I hear, the Carlyle, can compare or exceed.5) The techno deck-out in the room is the best I've encountered in NY. TV in bathroom, fax machine and multi-line phone for conference calls and internet on the flat-screen TV are standard features.6) A lot of people write it's expensive. Frankly, I think it's more than reasonable compared to other similar 5 stars along Central Park ways. The Ritz-Carlton charges 10-15% more for far worse. The 4 seasons is also more expensive. You need to compare apples with apples. No point comparing it to say the Novotel or Radisson.Discentives:1) Service is still spotchy. It is getting there but some kinks remain. The doormen do not open the doors or greet you with a smile. Bad first impression.2) Housekeeping can be a little wobbly with replacing things. However, this seems to be a NY/Western Hemisphere thing in general.3) The partially blocked views as mentioned. To be nitpicking, clear views would be great. However, if you are thinking about moving to the Trump for the view, think again. The same price will not get you a Central Park or even Hudson view. You get a view of a next door building and maybe the MO :-) I checked.4) Having travelled extensively in Asia as well, frankly most hotels in the Western Hemisphere need to catch up. Service, amenities, room space all pale next to the Asian hotels. I don't look at cost since cost of living is far higher in NY compared to say, Bangkok. Still, MONY is the closest I've come across in the U.S. to a class act nearly on par with it's Asian counterparts.It is my pick for a NY hotel.","London, United Kingdom","hanyu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",66,4.0

There to share a 60th birthday celebration with London friends and see my (American) husband's family for a visit. On arrival at 1pm we were told that our room was not yet ready (which we expected) but asked for the number in order to give it to our friends who had checked in the previous day at the hotel. The receptionist stumbled an answer 'oh we are not yet sure which one it is'. We are frequent travellers and whenver I hear this response I know that we are about to be told that we have been 'upgraded' and then shown to one of every 5 star hotels 'less than great' rooms. It has happened before. We already had a written confirmation of a deluxe Hudson River view room on a high floor which is what we wanted. Our friends had the same room type reserved so we went to see it. When 'our room' was ready - upgraded we were told, it was of course inferior on all counts, we asked to be changed to our confirmed room which was fine. Why do hotels do this. Theatres charge a lesser price for 'restricted view' seats. We all know that there will always be a few rooms in any fine hotel that are less good and the hotels would serve themselves well if they advertised these at lower prices. Instead what they try to do is hope that the client they put in these rooms will be too intimidated to ask for a change. I hate this especially as when we came into the downstairs lobby at the Mandarin via the lift to the 35th floor where the hotel starts, every employee greeted us en route 'welcoming' us to the Mandarin.Apart from this start, the hotel was good, modern and had most things one would expect. Except no coffee making equipment in the rooms - I think they think us (their clients) too 'posh' to make their own coffee but I know we both hated having to get up to find a cup. Most guests seemed to feel the same and popped out to the Starbucks across the road to pick up their morning coffees, but in the room would have been great.Weather was freezing in New York (6-11 April) but the lobby of the hotel on the 35th floor was kept cold by air conditioning - perhaps someone might mention global warming to the Mandarin.This is an expensive hotel which looks good and has all the trappings of a first class hotel but has no heart and not much of a genuine warmth to it. We have been to fine hotels where they manage to have boths looks and heart. We would not stay there on our next visit.

We went downstairs in the morning (well, my wonderful wife did) and got great, organic breakfast items and we ate them in our room, saving tons in the process.The lobby lounge: Plenty has been written here and none of it exaggerates the view and the atmosphere. Awesome.The room: Bigger and better than many NYC high-end hotel rooms. Fantastic view. Well appointed and functional. Top notch. Modern but classy. Bathroom was superb.Gym: Small but free, which is not the norm in many hotels these days. Good cardio equipment with TV’s in them. Excellent indoor lap pool. We booked through Platinum Am Ex and received a room upgrade, a 4 PM checkout, a $100 spa voucher and continental breakfast each morning. All for $630 or so. Well worth it. We’ve recently stayed at both RC’s in NYC and The Sofitel and enjoyed them all but it’ll be MO from now on for us.","Rumford, Rhode Island","DeansDesk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rumford, Rhode Island</strong>",177,4.0

You enter the hotel lobby by elevator (I think it is around the 40th floor where the hotel begins. You exit out the elevator into the hotel lobby which has very high ceilings and has a beautiful view of Central Park. There is an excellent bar which is to the right of the lobby which also serves the most divine desserts that I and my girlfriend have ever tasted. We routinely dine at the finest (according to Zagat) restaurants on Long Island and NYC for your reference. To the left is the hotel's signature restaurant and directly sunken in front of the lobby is a nice lounge area reserved for hotel guests. All of these areas have beautiful high city and park views. On to the room => The room that we booked overlooked Central Park. The ceiling height must have been at least 15 Feet to the best of my recollection with large floor to ceiling windows the length of the room. The room was large by NYC standards. The marble bath room was very large and had separate showering and toilet and makeup areas. There was french door separating the bath room from the hallway. While there we had occassion to order dinner from room service. The kitchen answered promptly at 11:30PM and had dinner to us ""in 20 minutes"" which was actually 15 minutes. The dinner and desserts were excellent and the staff was very courteous. Our room also included breakfast for the $1400 nightly fee at their signature restaurant in the morning. We headed down about 9AM and found a beautiful bright dining area that was buzzing with activity. The service was very prompt. The breakfast was a continental breakfast and was also excellent. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. You get what you pay for. It is clearly one of the best in Manhattan.

The doorman offered us bottled water while we were waiting since it was a hot day. The front desk person showed us to the elevator and then handed off the key, offering to carry my shoulder bag up to the room. We ordered room service and it arrived in 30 minutes. The food was good.

We were given a handicapped room, of which the only problem I had was that the shower had a regular plastic curtain instead of glass. Diminished the luxe somewhat for me. The bathing amenities were very nice, as were the towels, robes and linens. The LCD TV was o.k - the HDTV channels went out several times which was quite annoying. We had to call IT to come reset it.

The location was great for us - you have your own entrance to the Shops at Columbus Circle, which includes Whole Foods and Bouchon Bakery. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is elegant and luxurious without being stuffy. The front desk was exceptionally warm and welcoming, especially to our children. A smiling face can make such a difference.We stayed in an executive suite with a connecting park-view bedroom, and it was plenty of room for a family of four. The views from the suite were mostly looking west to the Hudson River - we really loved the views. The view from the park-view bedroom is dominated by Trump's hotel and another huge building in the process of being built - you only have a glimpse of the park squeezed in between these two buildings. Otherwise, that bedroom was great.The layout of the suite is a little awkward - rooms in the suite are off of a long, crooked hallway. Also, the main door from our suite to the hotel's hallway didn't connect solidly with the wall, so there was a slightly open gap, meaning we could hear a lot of noises in the hallway and even see a little into the hallway. But, since all of our rooms inside of the suite were off the crooked hallway, it didn't matter too much.The pool is simply gorgeous. It's in a very light-filled, long room on the 36th floor. It was almost empty both times we used it and the staff was very nice. There were a few mix-ups with housekeeping, including one time when she just walked right into our suite. The woman was very sweet and polite, so it wasn't a problem. The only truly negative aspect of this hotel is the price. It is shockingly, obscenely expensive.

I have been here for 7 nights with another 5 or so to go, so have had plenty of opportunity to work out the pros and cons.I write this as a regular guest at 4 Seasons, Ritz Carlton and the like and a frequent visitor to Hong Kong which has some of the best hotels in the world.I am lost for words at the excellence of this hotel which surpasses not only my expectations, but pretty much all my previous hotel stay expreiences. This is a truly superb hotel. It is is beautifully fitted out, the service is excellent (possibly only 9 out of 10 owing to some glitches in the public lobby lounge which is not as well staffed as the guest areas) and the overall experience is one of pampered luxury. Contrary to the experiences described in other reviews, the staff have been excpetionally friendly (the maitre'd knew at Asiate knew my name after one visit and made a point of greeting me by name thereafter).There is a wonderful pool. small but uncrowded and wonderful for laps or just wallowing.The views of Central Park (I am on the 52nd floor) are superb, even allowing for the fact that the Trump Hotel blocks part of the view.The hotel exudes an air of oppulent luxury and well-being.There is only one issue, which is the price. Everything is phenomenally expensive (continental breakfast in the room at around $45) and laundry that costs more than it would to replace the items that have been laundered.On this occasion I am not picking up the tab and the prices do not, therefore, disturb me. I think it is the price that probably accounts for a great deal of the dissatisfaciton expresssed in other reviews, as it is hard to imagine how this hotel could ever really deliver what most people would expect for rooms costing upwards of $1,000 per night, when the price is coming out of their own pockets.In summary this is a wonderful hotel, but I would advise against staying here if you are paying for it yourself and will be making a very detailed cost benefit analysis. This is a place for those on expenses, for celebs, for those who are truly hardened to paying for hotels of this class and for those who recognise that they are splashing out a very large amount of money for an unusually opulent treat.",London UK,"Incosol</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London UK</strong>",20,5.0

We requested a Central Park view which if we tilted our heads and looked through the high rise buildings we could just about make out some trees. We also booked the honeymoon package where we would have champagne and strawberries in our room on arrival (no champagne or strawberries to be found) and also exclusive use of the spa VIP room including treatments. When asked when we could use this facility we were given a look of ""haven't you already booked your date?"". It turns out the someone from the spa should have contacted us to make the booking but this hadn't happened. Luckily they were able to squeeze us in and it really was fantastic. The only bit of our stay that was. We had arranged a airport transfer with the hotel for a rather costly sum and when speaking to the concierge to arrange our transport back were we told that the payment made only took us one way, we would have to pay another $151.12 to be taken back to the airport. A total of $302.24! To rub salt in the wounds the driver told us that if we had contacted Virgin Atlantic we would have had the transfers for free. On the first night we arrived late and decided to eat in the hotel restaurant, the food was fine but very overpriced (and we left still feeling hungry). A further insult came while settling the bill. We decided to pay by cash and using the available funds on us settled the bill and left a rather moderate tip. (the service hadn't been that exciting to warrant a huge tip) The waiter took our money but then sent the restaurant manager back to ask why we had only left a 10% tip and not the usual 15-20%. To be honest I didn't think that we had been especially looked after and hadn't been swept off my feet with the service. The rooms are very overpriced and nothing to write home about. In comparision with the Hilton where you pay $90approx per night to the Oriental of $2200 per night (not including tax) the rooms aren't that different. To rip you off even more you have to pay to access the internet in your room (I would think for $2200 a night I should be able to access my emails for free).The hotel is a complete rip off, food is nothing special, the rooms are very standard, staff seem to have their minds on other things rather than looking after the guest and I would never stay there again. I contacted Manderin Oriental to explain all of the above, even filling out their post holiday questionnaire - I still haven't received a response.

It was HOT and HUMID and we were always provided and asked for bottled water.Now to the other aspect...The day before we departed, the trash was placed in a plastic bag and was left in the bathroom and was never picked up until we left. It could be the person who did the room cleaning forget to take the trash - but shouldn't happen in a five star hotel. Except for this one incidence, our stay was great.

The staff are wonderful and this is reflected in the service from the moment you enter and woosh up to the lobby on the 35th floor. I requested a non-smoking room only to enter my room and discover that someone had obviously been smoking in the room. The staff responded immediately and relocated me to another room. The room and the amenities were wonderful. The food from in room dining was delivered on time and was exceptional as was my dining experience in the restaurant. Now onto one serious problem. Twice during my stay, someone with a key tried to get into my room. The second time, the force was so great that it literally tore the bolts off the security bar on the door. The hotel did respond and were very apologetic -- but the experience was VERY unsettling. I was compensated for the trouble but left rather shaken. I suppose this could happen in any hotel, the fact that it happened at a property that demands in excess of $700 per night for a room is really disappointing. On a positive note, the hotel acted swiftly, apologized and did all of the right things in the face of the circumstances. I was more than satisfied with how they handled the situation. I would return to this property -maybe with a body guard! -- if only for the wonderful staff -- especially bellman Robert.",new jersey,"scooby19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>new jersey</strong>",78,4.0

We decided on the Mandarin because we have never even been to the Time Warner center and knew the Mandarin was the newest luxury hotel in the city. While the prices were way high we decided if we are going to do this lets go all out. When we booked the room there was a glitch in the pricing system and all rooms were going for $166. We decided to book right away and see if they would honor it. They did not but did offer up upgrades in class of room if we bought a standard rate. We did this and got a premiere Central Park view room for standard room price - still thats $750 for one night. We also got 20% discount on all spa activities although we had no plans on doing that.We checked in Friday at 3pm - took the elevator to the 35th floor to the elegant lobby. Our room was ready and check in was very fast. We then took the guest-only elevators (key cards required to operate) to our room on the 52 floor. The floor hallways are very tastefully done, best I have ever seen, and we proceeded to our room.The room was also very elegantly designed and felt very new. While the room was not large the bed was quite comfortable as was the large ottoman by the window. The view was great although obstructed by the Trump Hotel across the street. Still we could see most of the park and up Central Park South - quite attractive. The bathroom was big. We loved the soaking tub and the shower which has a rainshower feature where the water comes pouring out of a large multi-hole showerhead fixed in the ceiling.When I booked I informed the reservations agent it was our anniversary and the hotel delivered complimentary champagne, cake and chocolates that evening - a very thoughtful gesture that made us feel special.In the afternoon we used the pool which is nice but more for doing laps than relaxing but still there was only one person in it besides us so we enjoyed the 30 minutes we stayed.As an extra treat we saw Lance Armstrong in the elevator on our way to dinnerThe bed was very comfortable for sleeping that night.The next morning we had room service deliver breakfast. This was the only major disappointment of the stay. The eggs were watery and a glass of apple juice was $8 EACH!. We should have bought apple juice at the Duane Reade across the street and kept it for the morning. The $70 breakfast was not worth it.All in all while this was a very expensive 24 hours but as a one-time-only treat we had a great time and felt adequately pampered.

The hotel partly sells itself on its spa, which is one of the best in New York I think. When I booked I presumed that guests of the hotel could use the spa, ie the fancy showers and steam room etc - but when we arrived I found that you cannot use the spa unless you have a treatment, such a massage or facial etc which costs a minimum of $190 per person. However - if they are not busy in the spa a hotel guest can use the facilities at a cost of $50 per person. Not too bad. But all the facilities are separate for men and women, so if you are going with a husband or boyfriend, you won't be able to go in together. They should make all this clear on their website - but they don't.I wouldn't have rejected this hotel if I had known all this but it helps to be informed. I was disappointed that I couldn't use the spa with my husband and that I had to pay extra.However, all is not lost, if you don't want or can't afford a treatment, you can use the hotel pool and fitness centre, which are separate from the spa. The pool is lovely with views over the river and long too, 25 meters. There is a very small sauna in each of the male and female changing rooms.The bar at the reception is lovely, with a view over columbus circle and central park.After all my moaning, I'd go again!",London,"Adventurer3289</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",21,4.0

Our room, while not large, was immaculate and very comfortable. The view out the window was amazing and better yet, we heard absolutely no noise from outside. We thought it was a nice touch that the maitre d' in the lounge reserves tables for hotel guests so that even if the bar is packed, there's a table waiting for you. The air is a bit thick with the smell of money and celebrities (we saw Bono there) but we felt we were being treated just as well.

However my worries were unfounded and I can report our stay to have been outstanding in every way. We were staying for five nights (at $700 per room per night) and were upgraded to central park suites on the 54th floor (highest floor available). Although maybe not the largest rooms in NYC the views were breathtaking and resulted in us sleeping with the curtains open just to admire the once in a lifetime views. The staff are a credit to the company and the concierge was able to obtain great seats to the Fiddler on the Roof at 24 hours notice and excellent dinner reservations at Cipriani. Each morning every single staff member greeted us with a smile and a good morning welcome. The rooms were always kept well stocked and clean. We ate at Asiate (twice), and althought the food is not maybe the best in the world it is excellent and well worth a go if only for the views.

Some (but obviously not all) hotels will charge $400 - $500 and up because they offer an exceptional setting, environment, service level, or something else that makes them a cut above the rest. If you see yourself ready to spend $500+ a night for a transcendental experience at the the Mandarin Oriental New York, I have one word for you: ""PASS!"" My Central Park ""view"" room, including the ludicrous local taxes that added $100+ a night, was $800! For this I got a spectactular view of.... the Trump monstrosity across the street. This hotel stay was easily the worst - and OK, the stupidest - hotel decision I ever made. The rooms are expensively furnished, but not enough so to justify the price. The windows don't open. A chicken sandwich from room service with a soda will cost you $39. Sure, you have convenient access to the mall and the Whole Foods downstairs, but why not stay a half a block away on Central Park South for HALF the money? We moved out early, and went to the ""W"" on Park Avenue near Union Square, and had a lovely and HUGE room in a wonderul area (near the Village, SoHo, TriBeCa) for about half what we paid at the Mandarin. The Mandarin in my view is strictly for business people on an expense account, which, come to think about it, appears to be the demographic of the guests anyway. This was a ""once n a lifetime"" splurge to be sure, because I guarantee I am never coming back unless someone pays me to stay.",Los Angeles,"Journey802960</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",38,2.0

As this was our honeymoon we wanted something really special and the hotel did not dissapoint us.We ordered a car to take us to and from the airport - both drivers were extremely courteous and helpful. However we were quite surprpised that not only had we been overcharged on the price we had been quoted from the Mandarin Orientals website but we had also been charged an extra fee for 'waiting time' after we had gotten of the plane. As the car was $300 already, to be charged an extra $50 was quite a shock. We admit that it took an hour and a half to clear immigration (not our fault) and were willing to pay some extra charge however it appeared that we were expected to be at the car the second our flight had landed as thats when the over charging began! They did not even give us any time at all to clear immigration. After some complaining, the hotel did stick to the original quote but were not willing to budge on the waiting time and we ended up paying waiting time from the moment our flight landed! This was the only thing with potential to spoil the holiday.We had booked a premier corner hudson river view room as we had been told that some park views were obscured. The room was lovely, bright and clean, the view excellent - on the 52nd floor. The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in!The staff were friendly and courteous at all times and made our stay a very pleasant one. The turn down service was good and the flowers and proverbs left on our pillow were a nice touch - as were the biscuits and water!The views from the Lobby Lounge were excellent and we spent many an hour relaxing with great views. Service here was great. We did not eat in Asiete despite being charged three times for someone else's meal - however this was easily resolved with a telephone call.The pool was also lovely however with only four loungers a little on the small side. The TVs in all the machines in the gym make exercising a lot easier!The hotel is very expensive - drinks in particular as well as some of the food for what it was but we had a brilliant time - and as it was our honeymoon we were willing to pay these kinds of prices.All in all we felt pampered, happy and not at all patronised. We were very sad to leave the luxury and stunning views.We loved the Mandarin Oriental so much that we are now looking to try the one in Bermuda next year!",,Adventure3919,18,5.0

The location is a short walk from Lincoln Center, boutique shopping on Madison Avenue, and Broadway theater. We booked a corner suite with living room views of Central Park and bedroom views of both the park and hudson river. The room was absolutely perfect. Mandarin has installed flat screen, HD TV's with HD programing in each room and they are a treat. Floor to ceiling glass walls in both rooms make for incredible views. The restaurant is wonderful and has stunning central park views that soak in the morning sun. I can't think of a better place to have a leisurely breakfast. The lobby lounge can become crowded and is a bit too small to handle the demand so patrons overflow into a cramped, uncomfortable bar area during peak pre-theater hours. The bar is one of the few missteps and drinks are outrageously expensive, even by Manhattan hotel standards. On crowded evenings, the staff limits seating in the lounge to registered guests only, but there is still an occasional waiting list. The spa may be Manhattan's best (but book ahead) and the large lap pool is not to be missed. It's as if you are swiming along the Hudson.

We were looking forward to our stay at MO, since we have heard so many great things about the spa and hotel. We went with the AMEX platinum card and breakfast and lunch were included in our stay. We were also told that we would have an upgrade if one was available, but it wasn't.Checking in was swift and we were asked if we wanted tea to our room, which we obliged (However, tea never arrived, and we had to call to remind them hours later about it).Upon entering our room we had two single beds and a corner room away from elevators, exactly what we asked for (we told them that we were noise sensitive). The view was breathless. Nice view of river and NYC. However, we quickly noticed that the hotel room across the hall from us was under construction and they were using a table saw which was deafening. We quickly called the front desk to try to rectify the situation, and unfortunately received unprofessional responses. Basically the woman at the front desk said according to her computer there is no construction across the hall from us, so I held up the phone and asked if she could hear the saw that was blaring and she said ""no"". I felt as if she were calling me a liar. In any event, she said there were ""no rooms to move us to"" and we needed to ""wait 20 minutes, if it doesn't stop, then call us back"". I thought this was awful customer service for a hotel that is charging me $549 a night. We waited over 40 minutes, the saw did not stop, so we called again, this time we were a bit more aggressive, and a manager came up and ""investigated"" and made them stop. We then went to lunch at the lounge before the spa, it was pleasant. Service prompt and professional. Food was good. The highlight of our trip was the spa. It was an event that I will remember for a long time. The steam and whirlpool they offer before and after your treatments were divine. Towels, water, lavender infused cold towels and fresh flowers were everywhere. Meticulously clean. We had a general Swedish Massage and Shirodhara (oil and scalp massage). It was very nice. Relaxation room with private beds after treatments, with tea were heavenly. We went back into the steam before we left just because it was that amazing (generally I am not one for a steam room, but this was over the top!).After treatments, we decided to grab food at the Whole Foods market and call it an early night in the room with a movie. Great selection of foods there and a LOT less expensive! They came for turn down service after 10pm which I thought was too late for that service, but hey, its NY, and who is in bed at 10pm on a Friday night except us?Breakfast the next morning was good. Service again, very professional. However, upon returning to the room after breakfast, the infamous ""table saw"" was in full gear across the hall. Oh well.Overall, the Mandarin Oriental in MY opinion is a place to see and be seen. We had several celebrity sightings while there, and although our bill for one night with spa services came to over $1800, we couldn't help but to feel like staff and management viewed us as "" the common folk"". Even though the hotel and spa were wonderful, we were never made feel truly ""welcomed and pampered"". It always felt just a tad too stuffy for us. I think from now on we will stay with our usual addresses like Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton.","New York City, New York","Homergirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",484,4.0

I was looking forward to staying somewhere (anywhere!!) besides the Four Seasons on 57th which is our usual home in NYC, and I was hoping that we'd spend more time in the park given the location. We requested a one bedroom suite with a view of Central Park. There are probably some great things about the MO but the negatives led us to check out after our first evening.The good:Location! Across the street from the park, and above a shopping complex. I was very excited that the Whole Foods market was underneath us...just in case we needed something. Unfortunately, since we left the hotel early, I didn't get to check out the shopping.I also liked the Chihuly glass sculpture and paintings in the hotel lobby.Staff was great. And, I loved that they brought hot tea to our room after our arrival and had a beautiful assortment of cookies, fruit, and chocolate welcoming us to our room.Gift books, reading glasses, lap blankets, chaise lounge in the bedroom...there were many wonderful and thoughtful touches in the suite.The bad:The room. It was small and cold. Yes, it was a one bedroom suite, but it was not at all spacious. It felt like a long rectangular space with partitian walls dividing the bath from the bedroom and the bedroom from the living room. The ""look"" of the room and the furniture was fantastic. Straight out of Metropolitan Home. But, on closer inspection everything was very cheaply made, and the furniture was insubstantial and uncomfortable. The club chairs were so light that I (120 lbs) could slide one back simply by sitting down. The bathroom cabinetry was also poorly made, and the interiors of the cabinets were unfinished (exposed unpainted drywall). It was worse than a cheap track home. I don't make a habit of acting like a building inspector, but I was in the cabinets looking for a place to store my things. Did I mention there was little closet space? My clothes took most of the closet space....my husband never did get unpacked.The overall feeling in the room was cold, in part because of the wood floors with area rugs. Since there was little area, the rugs were under the furniture, so we were always walking on a cold floor.Great plasma TV, but the movie channel or the TV was not operating properly. The picture repeatedly disappeared for 5-10 minutes at a time leaving only the sound. Not good for ""watching"" a movie about dancing! No one could help, although someone tried to....right away. They didn't charge for the movie.The food. We ended up eating dinner at the lounge that evening after getting settled in the room. It was a little too dark for dinner, and the service was weak. Some of the menu items were great, others poor. I realized that I was trying too hard to enjoy the meal as my husband was obviously having trouble warming to this hotel.The next morning we packed up and went back to the Four Seasons. For the same price we returned to our one bedroom suite there, that in comparison to the suite at the Mandarin Oriental, is more like a house. Hallways leading to the various rooms, ""real"" furniture, wall to wall carpet, a phenomenal master bath (nothing unfinished about these rooms!) At the Four Seasons suite, everything feels as good as it looks.I would never even try to stay at the MO again. I have no idea how the other rooms compare, but the deluxe, one bedroom suite was not worth the money, nor did it compare to the luxury of the Four Seasons.",San Diego,"FromDeb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",76,2.0

We stayed in a ""Premier Park View Room,"" on the 46th floor for 3 nights over New Year's Eve. Upon walking in the room, the first thing you notice is the gigantic, black Trump Tower that filled 30-40% of the ""park view!"" The bellman dropped that when the MO opened, Trump hung a banner on his hotel goading guests with a better view -- not surprising.The room was spacious and well equipped. The bed was super comfortable, in the same class as the Heavenly bed at the Westin and W hotels. The electronics (TV, stereo, etc.) were mediocre and had to be rebooted several times during our stay when the TV wouldn't turn on, change channels, etc. A modern Tivo and other components would do a much better job. The bathroom was large and very nice, but only had one sink. Although we were offered tea at check-in, we ordered coffee when we got into the room. The bill was $26 for a small pot!We spent a half-day in the MO Spa, which was fantastic. The VIP room has a private shower, soaking tub, bathroom, day bed and massage tables. The spa service was second to none, and like the hotel, expensive.On NYE, we enjoyed dinner at Asiate, the hotel's restaurant. The initial service was a little slow but picked up through the meal. The food itself was good, not spectacular. The hotel's lounge offers great views of the park and Columbus Circle (they also suffer from being blocked by Trump Tower).Overall, the MO New York doesn't compare well to other 5-star hotels I've been fortunate enough to stay at. They need to sort out the in room electronics and come back down to reality on food and room pricing (to be fair, compared to other NYC hotels we ate at, they are close).

We found the hotel public spaces and room to be an architectural and interior design masterpiece. The designers did a wonderful job of melding the understated, elegant, peaceful asian atmosphere of MO with the vibrant exuberance of NYC. It seemed as if wherever we stood within the hotel, we were treated to the most spectacular views of NYC I have ever seen. Its location within the brand new Time Warner Center is sublime. It gives a whole new dimension to Columbus Circle and the scale and exterior design of the place is awe-inspiring.Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a Premier Hudson View Room, and what a room it was. Beautiful and plush with every amenity imaginable. It was a corner room with sweeping views of the river and city from every vantage point. We could lie in bed and have a perfect view of the Empire State Building directly in front of us. Amenities included plasma TV, DVD CD comprehensive entertainment system with surround sound, deep soaking tub with another great view, separate marble shower with huge rain shower head, minibar with great selection of beverages and Dean & DeLuca goodies, luxe bedding and feather pillows, robes, slippers, Fiji water and fresh flowers at turn down etc.We also had the pleasure of visiting the hotel spa. This was by far the best spa experience I have ever had. Again, the place is beautiful and refined. We were advised to arrive 45 mins early to use the ""heat and water experience"" which consists of beautiful, separate whirlpool, sauna/steam bath areas for men and women. Then a rest in the co-ed tea lounge and you're off to your treatment. By the time I got to my massage, I was already so relaxed that the transition was seamless. Afterwards, I was escorted to the relaxation room which is yet another exquisite area with daybeds, fountain, refreshments and more spectacular views of NYC.While the young staff was very friendly and tried very hard, I give the hotel less than five stars right now because of some of the gliches they are still having with service. Examples are, waited 40 mins. for our bags to be brought to our room upon check in (called several times and my husband finally had to go down and find them), room service a little slow (however the food was delicious), difficulty getting room service trays removed, turn down service on second night was very late (we were already in bed), minor difficulties with entertainment center that had to be reset on the second day. This and the fact that everything is EXHORBITANTLY expensive keep me from giving this hotel the highest mark. However, given the fact that it is still relatively new and working out the bugs, I am willing to give MO a little more time to become 5 star.Overall, a wonderful (albeit not cheap) hotel experience for any hotel snob.",philadelphia,"kitty33</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>philadelphia</strong>",173,4.0

I only stayed there because it was a last minute trip and there weren't any other 5 star hotels with a decent price. So I decided to splurge and stay at the Mandarin. When the doorman was present, they always opened the door and greeted me everytime. Most of the staff were friendly and always acknowledge me. I only had breakfast at the hotel and the waiter was pretty nice. I had a room with a Central Park and the city view. The only thing that was not so nice was that the Trump Tower was front of it. The room and the bathroom was a decent size and I really enjoyed having the plasma TV in the room and in the bathroom as well. All my room service and turn down service was down on time.

I believe the reason for the flux in reviews is that the hotel is new, still getting adjusted, although it’s been operational almost a year. I stayed twice, once in the opening, and my stay this time has improved slightly. There is no one way to go about having a perfect stay at this hotel, because the staff's attitude varies with great degree. Melissa at the concierge desk is an exception, her service is what it should be, warm and efficient. Lobby service is so-so, if you compare it to the breakfast service in Asiate, which is a bomb. Their is a simple lack of communication between managers that I witnessed in both these areas. The bar has a desirable vibe, overpriced drinks as one would expect. Spa is awesome, although overpriced. I know this is NY, but please, $240 for a massage, contribute to inflation a little more please... My next comment would be about the rooms themselves. I received a significant discount on my room, over $1,000-because I pointed out a list on departure-of things that were not meeting my price point. The windows in the rooms do not substitute for the lack of sq. ft. in the room. I ordered room service one night, and the server couldn't even fit the cart of food into the room (the corner of the bed prevented it). Who designed this room I wondered? The bathrooms are among the best I've seen, Mercer being the best in my opinion. Final thought: No need to pay the outrageous published rates, I called this hotel a dozen times, spoke with 5 different people, including Lara who is a manager, and found them guilty in not offering the lowest available rate, when I asked them. This is not a good practice, and Mandarin needs to understand their clients, like me, who don't have time to spend arguing about little negative incidental happenings that come up as a result of under-educating staff, and lack of a clear vision about what a 5-star, 6-star hotel should be in NYC...keep wishing Mandarin, you don't deserve it, at least not yet.","NYC, USA","TrvlSavy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC, USA</strong>",56,2.0

We were there soon after opening and agree with prior reviews about the dismal state of the service then. This seems to be mostly taken care of, with a few notable exceptions. The service is still not on par with some similar hotels. For instance, at the Four Seasons SF they always know our names by the time we get to the reception desk and everyone miraculously calls us by name throughout the stay. When my partner returns from runs at the FS SF or Ritz Phili, the doorman will have water and a towel waiting. Service is simply less personal than I would like at the MO. That being said, everyone was very warm and friendly. We booked our room through Platinum Travel (though not the FH&R rate) and were upgraded to a Premier Central Park View room. It was at the end of the hall and shared a vestibule with only one other room (a Premier CP View Suite). As a result, it was very quiet and we did not hear all the door noise other people have complained of. What can be said except that the view of the entire length of Central Park and Mid-town is spectacular. It is unfortunate that even on the highest floor the Trump building partially obscures things, but the view is still quite amazing. Sunrise was great and the reflection of the sunset off the surrounding buildings was also very nice. We have stayed at many of the top hotels in New York and there are few that can provide quality views from the majority of rooms. I also like the aesthetic of the MO more than most top NY hotels, which tend to be too traditional and fussy for me. I found the bed extremely comfortable and the shower was wonderful. The bath products are also very nice, much nicer than at other MO properties. There has been a lot of criticism of the technology in the rooms and complaints that they are too complex. Perhaps it is my younger age and residue of growing up with computers, but it seemd pretty intuitive. The HD LCD TV was great, as was the speaker system. The phone took a few minutes to master, but then it was easy. I also liked that the LCD TV in the bathroom was adjustable. It was odd though that it didn't have all the channels of the larger TV and that the networks were on different channels. On the negative side, the restaurant remains a problem. Though our food was consistent, if not overpriced ($90 for breakfast daily), the service was irregular. They never quite got everything right. We were not served bread the first day, but it came the second day. We were given a small amuse one day, but not the next. I had to ask for butter for my toast. No huge faux-pas, but annoying. Finally, one of the thing I like to do if I like a hotel and think I may come back is to ask for a tour of other room types I might book. They did not seem to know what to do with this request. First I was told no problem. Then the second person to get on the phone told me that it was not possible because not only did nobody have time (!!!!!), but I would need to make an appointment with the front office. What did she think I was, a reporter wanting to do a story? I was a guest, and they should have been happy to show me other rooms. At this time it was 1:30 in the afternoon and she finally said that the only person on staff who could show me around was not going to be back until ""this afternoon"" and could I stay in my room until she came back. When I informed her that it was already ""this afternoon"" and asked what she meant she said 2 p.m. Seeing as it was was 30 minutes and I had no plans I said fine. When nobody called me by 2:30 I left for the ""afternoon."" Over the course of 2 days they were never able to fulfill my quite simple request. We left without seeing other rooms, something that might have enticed me to spend money for a better room or suite next time. Their loss. It won't stop us from returning, but was an annoying way to end our stay.","New York City, New York","jm514</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",28,4.0

We stayed there in January 2004 and had to change rooms because the first room was uninhabitable but even the second one had its problems. The food and beverage department was in chaos. Room service tea came in coffee pots, or vacuum flasks which had previously contained coffee, or not at all. The chef bought tasteless strawberries and blueberries and called them seasonal berries - in January. On one night the bar was closed because the management had rented the whole place out, apparently to a shoemaker, for a private party.Due to the hotel's eagerness to make amends and the persistence of its guest relations manager, we stayed there again in August 2004. Everything in the room worked, although I was still incapable of mastering the TV system or the cordless phone.The staff seemed more relaxed. The views are wonderful and the beds a delight. The concierge service is excellent but foreigners might like to know that their knowledge of the main European languages, other than English) could be limited.There are still things wrong, of course (the chef continues to have his berry problem, for instance, and one of the staff rendered a check for breakfast with the gratuity line open, when 15% had already been included). They won't be able to do anything about the size of the rooms - not quite big enough - or the size of the closets - very small. If, like my wife, you solve the problem of what to take on vacation by taking everything, consider spending more on a suite because you probably get two closets and more drawers.But the transformation in seven months is to be commended. Housekeeping is world class. Engineering is world class. Staff have a happy and friendly attitude. Clearly some very hard work has been put in to get things right and the Mandarin Oriental is now worth the journey.","London, England","FirstBruno</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",125,4.0

A view, flat screen TV, bedside controls, and seperate shower/tub in the bathtroom are not enough for the hotel to charge $595. The room was WAY to small for that price. I would say my room was in the neighborhood of 400 squarefeet. I would say rooms at this hotel are worth AT most $450 a night, if you are paying more than that, stay at the Four Seasons or ST REGIS hotel.

After watching the fireworks show, and walking around the city, my sister and I accompanied, a few friends back to the hotel. We were staying at the Swissotel and after hearing them boast about how beautiful their hotel was, we decided to go see it for ourselves.  When we arrived there was no doorman to greet us at the door, he was actually at the front desk chatting with the front desk clerk. When we passed them they stared at us blankly, and then asked us if they could help us. The whole exchange was quite cold, not at all what I expected from a 5-star hotel.  The tip of the iceberg was when we were on our way out. We left through the mall exit, after searching for an ATM machine, and returned to the front desk so that my sister and I could get a cab to return home. It was 4:30 in the morning and pouring rain outside, yet once again we had to open the doors ourselves. Now I’m not sure if it was the fact that we were young or Black, or a combination of the two but the same doorman and front desk clerk we had not passed but a half hour before, asked us if we were guests at the hotel. My friend replied that yes we were indeed guests. Incredulous, I asked the front guest clerk why the doorman asked this question when then they both saw us come in. To this she replied, “Well, we saw you go in, but did not see you go out.”  Stunned we went outside to wait for the doorman to hail us a taxi. While waiting, we observed the doorman who had previously neglected to open the front door for us, open it for a different group of guests at the hotel. The final insult came when after trying to hail a taxi for my sister and I for about 5 minutes, the doorman pointed us towards the umbrellas and told us we were better off standing on the corner and hailing the taxi from there. My brief visit to the hotel was terrible, and I would not under any circumstances visit there again.","Bronx, NY","Pathfinder4683</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bronx, NY</strong>",19,1.0

We've actually stayed at the San Francisco one and the Miami one in the last six months. The new york one is gorgeous, but the drawbacks to this hotel is likely related to the fact that it is in new york. The rooms in SF and Miami were spacious and gorgeous.. The room we had in NY was small but still well decorated. The location of our room (near some service area where room service carts kept entering and the door kept slamming) was lousy. We were also at the end of a hallway where there were literally 4 other hotel room doors outside our door and no noise insulation, and our neighbors felt very comfortable slamming those doors around. For 600+ a night, this is not quite what I had in mind. Yes, NYC is crowded and real estate is at a premium, but I had expected more from the Mandarin Oriental.

I don't think they should have opened so soon, not only was the building still in pieces (chipped paint on doors, walls, ceilings; TV not functioning, internet down, room service 1.5 hours, pool closed) and the level of service was not their. The staff's service lacked efficiency, it seemed no matter what I asked for, and it took 30 min.I was back in New York last week, and stayed at the Ritz Central Park, my first. It was a disappointing experience from the start, but to their credit their management staff was courteous enough to find me another hotel, offering the MO New York. I agreed to move, thinking I would give them another shot --and Ritz was picking up the charges for my 2 night stay.I was welcomed back warmly, funny how they somehow remembered me. The arrival was smoother than I had remembered, and the on duty manager was gracious enough to extend a suite upgrade, even with a sold-out hotel. The tea did not take 45 min this time, the pool was open-what a view! I made a point to inspect whether the staff had gone back to touch up the paint chips on the doors and walls, which they did! The WiFi was up and running, so convenient and calming to sit early morning in the sky lounge overlooking Central Park, perhaps the best view in New York.Reading some of the previous comments, I sympathize with my fellow 'guinea pigs' for trying out this property, however my second experience reminded me that one bad encounter is not always the end-all. My hats off to the extremely courteous bell staff, front desk staff, and the level of professionalism put forth by all. Understandably any new property is going to have its own growing pains.

As this was my partners first time in New York I wanted to make sure we had no unnecessary issues or problems. We had several communications between staff and were assured that we would have a memorable stay. I had booked the stay through Centurion Travel Services for 2 nights for 1 in a Premiere Hudson View room with Lunch for 2. In my mail I requested a quiet room on a high floor away from elevators and service entrances, basically a room that would be quiet.We were collected from JFK by a stretch limousine (surprise for my partner) from our long haul flight and arrived at the hotel around 6pm on Friday. Our arrival rather worryingly there was no doorman or bell boy. My partner and myself were left to drag our bags in to the unmanned reception area, we then made our way to the lift which turned our to be the entrance for the residential apartments!We eventually made it to the reception and were checked in by a very warm and courteous staff member who proceeded to take us to our Premiere Hudson View room on the 51st floor. The hotel was jam packed so they had been unable to upgrade us as had been mentioned in our previous correspondence, but this was not really a big deal.The room was delightful, small, but very well furnished with a wonderful bathroom and views of NY/Hudson River. As we settled in we were surprised to hear a lot of banging, on investigation it appeared that our room was located directly opposite a service entrance. Unfortunately the doors had little if any sound proofing making the noise rather unbearable. As we had previous correspondence with the manager and staff I had assumed there was some mistake and returned to the check in desk. On return it appeared that they had no other rooms available, and I asked to talk with the Duty Manager. After a short while I was then shown a room next door, but as you can expect this still had issues with noise. I returned to the reservation desk to be met by a rather abrupt and cold duty manager, I referred to my correspondence previously with the General Manger, but his had little if any impact. The Duty Manager then went on to inform me that due to the configuration of the hotel a large number of the rooms suffer from noise.Nearly an hour later, frustrated, tired and late for a meeting, the Duty Manager informed us they found a room but that we had to wait for housekeeping to freshen it up. As we were already late we told reception that as long as the room was quiet to go ahead and move our bags. On our return we found that our hotel had become he number one spot in New York and that we had to queue to gain entry I explained our situation but was told to wait in line!Eventually when we regained entry we found ourselves moved down to a room on the 43rd floor with a wonderful view of the Trump Hotel (Supposedly Park View)! The room was again comfortable and nicely decorated although not as pleasant as the original and with a smaller bathroom even though the room was classified an upgrade. There was no note in the room or message from the manager which would have helped in a small way to placate the situation. Instead every detail about this hotel that now went wrong had became a very big nagging one.Unable to sleep partly due to jet lag and also the annoyance of the situation I went down to the lobby to write an email to the manager conveying my concerns. I arrived in the lobby at 6am and found that there was no one around, and I mean no one, so I went behind the reception desk and called the operator to order some tea. Eventually staff arrived 20 minutes later as did my tea. In the meantime I put together an email for the manager and logged on to the hotels WIFI network to send it. Yet again I was faced by another problem the hotels WIFI setup was not functioning so I asked to speak to the next Duty Manager and presented the email on my laptop. He was exceptionally courteous and understanding of the issues and assured me that he will do all that he can to put us into a nice room. I reasserted that we did not want an upgrade just a room as originally agreed ""on a high floor away from elevators and service entrances"".We were out for the rest of the day and returned to the hotel at around 6pm on Saturday. At reception we picked up our keys for our new room located on the 42nd floor 9 floors down from the original, although I believe we were meant to be impressed by the fact we had been awarded a suite. The suite was cold and unwelcoming with no carpets just black floor and occasional rugs, compared to the other rooms this one felt inferior in finish infact as though it had not been finished. Again no note or message from the manager. It also appeared to be located right on Columbus Circle meaning that the noise levels were higher than any of the previous rooms! Understandably we were at the end of our tethers and realised that this hotel was never going to be able to deliver on service or promise, something we found very disappointing for a member of the Mandarin group. As previously arranged I spoke to the Front Of House Manager informing him of my dismay at the hotel and its handling of our situation. What is the point of extensive communication with the hotel's General Manager when the requests are ignored. In all fairness he did wish to resolve the problems, but as we were departing the next day we felt there was really nothing they could do to restore our faith in this hotel.On Sunday we were joined by a friend for lunch in the hotels restaurant which was very enjoyable, infact the breakfast and Lunch were about the only 2 times this hotel really lived up to the Mandarin vision. As it was late and the restaurant was due to close we decided to take our tea and coffee in the lobby, but on transfer were told by another member of staff we would have to wait an hour for a table as the hotel lobby is very popular!Then came check out with the Duty Manager from our first night, the bill came out and contained a few errors. Firstly it contained charges for lunch which was complimentary and secondly it contained a charge for 2 nights when we were on the Centurion offer, 1 night free. Starting to feel like a pariah I noted these mistakes to the rather disgruntled Manager who went onto inform me that as my reservation had been made by Platinum Travel the offer of the free night was not valid. Thankfully I had a confirmation from Centurion Travel in my suitcase and found this rather needless situation a prime example of the hotels negative attitude. To placket the manager I travelled down 35 floors to our stored baggage and collected my paper work, queued up for the lift and returned to the reception. After some more discussion she begrudgingly removed the 2nd nights charge, however had she referred to my correspondence with the manager this embarrassing situation would have been avoidable.My partner and myself had a wonderful weekend in New York and a memorable stay at the Mandarin Oriental, but for all the wrong reasons. This hotel fails to live up to the values of this superb group and failed to tackle problems when it had the opportunity. Indeed the hotel has many wonderful aspects and is a visual delight, but I'm sorry to say that it is a victim of its own success. Queuing up to get into you hotel, queuing up to sit in your on lobby and being given assurances that are not met does not a 5 star hotel make , far less a Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Sadly this was one place I was more than happy to check out off and will not be returning to soon.","London, UK","MadeInScotland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, UK</strong>",35,2.0

I'm gald that we stayed and were able to enjoy a breathtaking view of the city for a night but won't stay there again.,"New York City, New York","josiegrammer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",99,3.0

We'd actually planned to stay there last November but it wasn't quite open (there was some slippage as is normal with new buildings of this scale). To their credit, MO gave us the ""soft opening"" rates when we went back last week, and upgraded us to a Premier Central Park View room on the 51st floor as we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary.The view, obviously, is incredible. Although Trump's building is right in front the position of the new tower is such that you still get great views around it. However, the room is pretty tight for space - if you're from the UK you may have stayed in a 'Travelodge' and the room is just like a more upscale version of that kind of room. The high-tech tv/computer set up is a little too tricksy - like other reviewers, we did have to call tech support (in our case just to be able to change the volume on the TV!) but to be fair they were fast on the scene and quick to fix the problem, which remained fixed.There were a few little glitches with the service, overall it's just not as slick as the Four Seasons - possibly it just needs some bedding-in time, although both my wife and I noticed the quality of fit-and-finish is nowhere near the FS standard.For such an expensive and high-profile (and spectacular) building it really seemed like they'd ""spoiled the ship for a ha'peth of tar"" so to speak.We found the Asiate restaurant a bit like the hotel - i.e. very flash and spectacular but a bit too tricksy. Sometimes fusion food sounds unlikely but really works when you taste it (the shrimp with pasta cooked in paper with XO sauce is superb), but mostly it tasted as odd as it sounds. To be fair, though, we had eaten the previous evening at the consistently excellent Four Seasons restaurant (not affiliated with the hotel) and the night before at Daniel Boulud's DB, and both were really exceptional, so Asiate had a high bar to reach.It will always be full, because of the beautiful room and stunning view, and it's definitely worth a look.The intimate ""MO bar"" across the lobby is fabulous, but permanently very busy with both New Yorkers and tourists from other hotels, as is the lobby bar. I guess it's the view again - quite a rarity still in NY.One nice touch is the private access to the shopping centre from the hotel's elevator - makes you feel privileged somehow! The shopping is nothing special but there's a good Dean & Deluca in the Borders store and some great restaurants which should all be open by the time you go!Overall, then, fantastic experience (and great view) but next time, if I were paying the full rate, I'd still choose the Four Seasons - for the same money you'd get a (less spectacular) view and a much bigger room, plus it's quieter, better quality and smoother service. But I am grateful to have experienced the MO.",,Explorer7884,16,4.0

The rooms are pretty expensive (> 700 bucks for Hudson view), quite smallish (though the later one is somehow compensated by the floor to ceiling windows and the lovely bathroom, that is really unique- try to get a hudson view room, so you can enjoy the view while having a bath, it's fun). Lastly the Hi-Tech stuff is fun but you don't really (at least i don't) care wether the screen is plasma or not as long as it's not yours. Still, the biggest drawbacks are : 1. Room service is very slow and not a level with a 5 star hotel. 2. Way too many people want to go to the lobby, and the staff spends more time routing them to the restrooms than answering your questions.","geneva, switzerland","gougoul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>geneva, switzerland</strong>",66,4.0

Unfortunately my overall experience was disappointing. The rooms were indeed beautiful(if a little small). The doormen and reception people were very nice, and the housekeeping service was good , although the nightly turndown was a little intrusive. Room service was a major problem. The menu is very limited and expensive(not unexpected by New york standards). One afternoon I ordered up a child's and an adult portion of ice cream. One hour later it arrived-two bowls with 3 tiny scoops each for $45. I consider this to be outrageous. My daughter and I ordered up room service dinner 2 nights in a row and the food arrived cold both times. Finally, there is no sundry shop to by incidentals or toiletries. Their shop is limited to spa items and condoms. A five star hotel needs to have reliable, good room service and a place to get necessities as well as expensive candles. in the future we will stay at the Four Seasons, Ritz, or Peninsula- hotels that understand that substance is of equal or greater importance to style.","Atlanta, GA","LoveTravel17941</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, GA</strong>",8,2.0

The location is great, we watched the Macy's Parade from the lobby lounge. We had a luxurious stay, though there are a few kinks they still need to iron out since it is brand new.The jacuzzi in the spa was not working when we wanted to use it. The passcode system for the lockers was way too complicated, they could just implement a key system like any other spa. The gym is nice because the machines face all glass windows. Most gyms at that caliber have individual TVs, however, or at least a few flat screens with individual earphones. The gym staff gave each guest a water bottle at the gym but it was warm. A simple water cooler would have been better. Also spas and gyms at similar hotels (like the Ritz) can usually provide gear if you forget it. This one did not. Finally, the music in the gym was not the type of music that can really get you pumped. How can you work up a good sweat listening to Celine Dion??The room was a bit small, even for New York City, and we were certainly not upgraded like the others who reviewed the hotel. But it was well worth it for the amount we paid. We took advantage of the special, one free night with at least a 2 night stay. So our room averaged about $300 per night.The bell hop and other staff were exceptional. The flat screen tvs were wonderful and the bath experience was really special. The bathrooms were simply like none I have seen before.The bar has a great view, and it's great even for just drinks. We had no problems with the internet in the room, but the wireless access in the bar area worked great also. We were able to use our wireless card to get free access in the bar area, which worked great. Unfortunately, they haven't set up routers so that you can get wireless in your room. It's a nice place to have a cup of coffee/drink and get some work done.","Lafayette, California","ushma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lafayette, California</strong>",213,4.0

Great sound system.The bathroom is great. Had a large window next to our bathtub, flat screen TV in bathroom with remote to use from the tub. The shower was large with a ""Rain"" system from the ceiling - very unique.Seperate toilet area with frosted glass door.The staff was wonderful. Our room was always freshened up in the evening before we returned.Always clean towels, etc.Only wish there would be ice machines on the floors. Had to order it & it came in a small silver icecontainer.Security is tight. We got a call from security asking if we knew that our room door was ajar.

The room, bed, and views of Central Park from the 50th floor were heavenly, but didn't get an upgraded room, even though I was promised one at check-in. Aside from this hiccup, service was top-notch during the four nights of my visit (special kudos to the superb bellhop/doorman staff!). Loved the new flat screen HDTVs, even though they had several technical problems. At one point, my TV stopped responding to remote control commands, requiring a 4:30am visit and ""reboot"" from tech staff (it wouldn't turn off!). Was also unable to get the high speed internet to work during my entire stay, though wireless worked ok (reception was very weak, however). New Years Eve at Asiate and the MO/Lounge were excellent, albeit pricey, and the party ended early (1:30a). Room service food quality was very good, but not quite excellent (one burger was not cooked to order). The surrounding area is great, but the new Time Warner building and Columbus Circle are still a huge mess (tons of construction!). The situation should be much better by the spring of 2004, by which time the new TW shopping concourse will be open. Overall...MO/NYC, while stellar, remains a notch or two below NYC's ""benchmark"" luxury hotel, the Four Seasons. My wife and I would love to come back, though.","Bloomington, Indiana","blout</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bloomington, Indiana</strong>",65,5.0

The whole of one side of the suite (lounge and bedroom) overlooked Central Park whilst another wall of the bedroom looked towards Midtown.The service and friendliness of the staff could not possibly be bettered from the front desk to the fitness centre to the bellman who actually ran out to Broadway to hail a cab and came back a minute later in the said vehicle. Also an early check-in and late check-out (without charge - take note Intercontinental Barclay) were nice thoughts as was the use of the fitness centre even after check out before we flew out that evening.There were lots of little touches too.

The expansive 35th floor lobby sets the tone -- a beautiful sunken lounge in front of 15 foot high windows looking down upon Central Park and Midtown is what you notice first, then the understated front desk and concierge stand areas. Seperate elevators quickly whisk you up to the guest floors. My room overlooked the park. 10 foot high floor to ceiling windows expansing the entire width of the room really make the 420 sq. foot room feel even bigger. If you love hi-tech -- this is top notch: phones from Cisco systems; 42"" plasma TV, smaller flat screen in the bathrooms; table top mini-speakers to provide excellent hotel-room sound.As you would expect, excellent quality linens, feather pillows, duvets, etc. Pastry shop made chocolates at turndown.What differentiates this room vs. say, the Ritz Central Park, is the bathroom. Deep soaking tub, seperate shower with option of either a hand wand or ceiling mounted rain shower head.Did not dine in the hotel, but room service menu had the standard items you would expect, all with an asian twist (i.e. Kobe beef style cheeseburger with a ginger-mango chutney).Grand Opening rates are making this a real find right.
