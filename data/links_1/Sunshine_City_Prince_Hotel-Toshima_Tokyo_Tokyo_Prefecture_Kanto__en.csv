The building is big but very old. The shopping mall just downstairs which I like. However the wall is really thin which I can’t believe, you’ll feel no privacy as you can hear the next door the people talking. The service staffs is hospitality and they provide shuttle bus to airport. Compare the price and room, I would choose other new hotel to stay. ",,ETNN9099,125,3.0

This was the second time we’ve stayed at the Sunshine Prince. Check-in was quick and easy without any issues. Our 2 rooms this year were for the City Floor Twin Room B configuration on the24th floor. We had the twin Type C configuration last year. The additional cost for the B configuration was well worth it. Room B is a traditional side by side bed configuration while Room C is an end to end bed configuration. Room B is also about 50 square feet larger. The beds were firm and 2 pillows were provided per bed. Both pillows were very flat and my wife and I ended up having to use our travel pillows in order to provide adequate support. The rooms had a small desk, a small refrigerator, a small open closet area (in one of the 2 rooms), and a safe. The TV was approximately 32” with just one station that broadcasted in English (NHK). The bathroom had a small counter and a combo shower/tub. Water pressure was very good as was the water temperature. Climate control for the room was not good. There was no way to turn on the AC and there was no ventilation in the rooms so the rooms were constantly warm and stuffy (~75 degrees). Wi-Fi was excellent; we were always able to connect to the internet and we did not experience any dropped connections while we were there. Housekeeping was excellent as was the hotel staff (very friendly and they speak English). Despite our issues with the pillows and climate control, the location of the Prince still makes it an ideal hotel to consider. It’s proximity to the Sunshine Mall (convenience store, restaurants, souvenir stores), the Sunshine Strip (stores, eating establishments, game arcades), and closeness of the subway stations can’t be beat. The Airport Limousine also drops off and picks up directly from the hotel. I highly recommend the Sunshine City Prince Hotel and look forward to staying there again in my future visits to Tokyo.","South San Francisco, California","Nathan C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South San Francisco, California</strong>",14,5.0

Check in took an hour. There was a line but it shouldn’t have taken that long. I’ve stayed at 5 star hotels to boutique hotels and never had this type of check in experience before. Any request or question you have is a bureaucratic and lengthy process. No one is empowered to do anything without going up a long chain of command. 2. If you’re a foreigner visiting, be aware that they charge per guest, not per room. My reservation was under my name and was a big room that was designed for 2-3 people. When my spouse and I arrived, I was surprised to learn that there would be extra charges attached because he would be in the room even though none of the amenities had changed. This also happened to two businessmen who were checking in next to me. They booked a room with two beds and were surprised to learn that there would be more charges attached. Be aware that some Japanese hotels will do this. If this bothers you, like it did for me, consider looking into hotels that are part of a more upscale global chain. Mathematically, you should check to see what the difference is — if those hotels charge per room and the locals ones like Prince, charge per guest, you might as well stay at a 4 star hotel if the price discrepancy is nominal. 3. The bathroom is atrocious. It looks like a a plastic box they just added on. It feels like you are showering and using a toilet in a trailer versus a hotel. Very low ceilings. I saw 3 different rooms and they were all the same. Toilet in the rooms have low water pressure (although the shower pressure was strong). 4. While the hotel claims to have nonsmoking rooms, we had to change rooms twice because it stunk so badly. 5. Pillows/Towels/amenities - The pillows were incredibly flat and uncomfortable. No body lotion and no bar soap. Expect the bare, bare, bare minimum. Towel count was low. 6. Location - very convenient that there’s a Family Mart convenience store inside and there is a mall attached to the hotel (food not good but the shops had some solid tourist goods). Harakuju, Shinjuku, Shinbuya are at least a 20 mins taxi ride with no traffic. Train stop is about half a mile away and is also a 20-30 min ride to these areas.7. Breakfast Buffet - it’s not great. Not atrocious but not something you would ever want to pay for out of pocket. We ended up trying to find other places to eat at. In short, if you are looking for a no frills hotel where you can just lay your head at night to rest and the location is close to where you have to be, it’s just fine. The staff is generally polite, some definitely more polite than others. I thought Mr. Kim was wonderful (he is the reason why I’m bumping it up from 2 star to 3) and there’s another woman who spoke English who was helpful. But come with a translator (human or electronic) because it will be easier to communicate. Most of the staff don’t speak English (which I don’t fault them for since it’s Japan but being that it was a hotel, it would have been less frustrating if there was more on staff who could). If you are looking for a place in a trendy, bustling area where it is more of a luxury or comfortable hotel experience, avoid. Japan is a lovely country but next time I plan on spending more and booking at a chain hotel. It’s worth it. Everyone is different but personally, I like being very comfortable when I’m traveling and away from home.

Room and bathroom was small by western standards. Main problem for us was the lack of storage space in the room as there is no cupboard space or shelves in the room or bathroom, just some open hanging space on the wall which meant we had to live out of our suitcases in a room with little space for suitcases. Lack of space was really the only problem we had as the room was clean and beds comfortable, and hotel breakfast buffet was reasonable quality.

It was so dated. And I thought I was staying in a hostel .It went through renovation and because i decided to stay in Tokyo for two more days, there were not many hotels available, I gave it another go.I read the reviews , I didn’t have much expectation about this hotel at all.Surprisingly , it was so much better than before. The staff were all very nice. They were all very helpful. I asked the housekeeper to lend me the hoover so I could vacuum pack my stuff.she was so kind and helped me. I didn’t experience anything like “no smile” “bad attitude” from the staff like what other reviewers said at all.The room was small but was a standard size in Tokyo .It was spotless .i had 2 big suitcases, one big travel bag and a handbag , and the room was spacious enough to accommodate me to open all the suitcases and bags at the same time. I was staying at the panoramic floor.the view was great. I didn’t experience the lift problem like other reviewers said at all! Most of the time, I was the only one in the lift and i didn’t have to wait more than 30seconds for the lift. I did take the lifts stopping at all floors, but it was not crowded at all.The only downside of the room was the air conditioning. You could adjust the speed of it. However, the room was still very warm.It was in the shopping centre and about 10 -15mins walk from the Ikebukuro station if you have luggages with you. However , they have the bus going to haneda airport and Narita airport right outside the hotel.I think most “single” or “double” room in Tokyo is really comfortable for one person only .

As to be expected, the hotel was very clean, from the common areas to the restaurants, elevators and room floors. The check-in process was somewhat challenging, as the staff here speak VERY LITTLE to NO English. However, with a couple of short words, we were able to commmunicate. The rooms ARE NOT like those in American hotels. The rooms are VERY SMALL. However, it worked out fine for me, as I was in a room alone. My room was on the 32nd Floor....SUPERB VIEW OF THE CITY! Both at night and during the day, it was great to just stare out the window at the skyline! Back to the room: THERE ARE NO CLOSETS. There is a rack to hang clothes on; I had brought my own hangars for my suits, slacks, and shirts, so it was okay. The bathroom is VERY SMALL. It is similar to a standard bathroom on a cruise ship. Mine was a ""step up"" and had a tub and shower. The bathtub is short, maybe about 4 ft long, but nice and deep for a relaxing bath at the end of the day. The breakfast buffet in the hotel is okay. It came with my reservation so I took advantage of it. The food is the same everyday; the don't change it, at least not while I was there. It is fresh and, as to be expected, a combination of some American staples (eggs, pancakes, French fries) and Japanese cuisine (fish, rice, soup). The same outlet provides a dinner buffet as well. There are two other restaurants in the hotel, one offering Chinese cuisine and another offering traditional Japanese cuisine. The hotel has a convenience store which is like a mini 7/11. You can get some refreshments and even some hot meals there, along with alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. You need to have either a credit card or yen because they DO NOT accept Amiercan currency. The hotel is connected to a FABULOUS mall, inclusive of some really nice stores and restaurants. The mall also contains an aquarium, which I visited and was quite enjoyable. There is also a planetarium (did not visit) as well. The Mall has a location to exchange money, which YOU WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO UTIIZE. The hotel/mall is also a direct conduit into the subway, which was very convenient for getting around the city. There are shops in the subway too! Again, BRING A CREDIT CARD OR YEN. Staying at this hotel, you are right in a very busy section of the city. If you walk through the Mall, down into the subway area and through, you will reach the outside of the hotel and there are TONS of shops and restaurants right in the hotel's perimeter! I found a post office, TGI Fridays, Denny's, and of course, Starbucks, all within a 5 minute walk from the subway! There are electronic, clothing, and shoe stores right on the street, along with 2 video arcades; there's a SEGA store with multiple floors for playing games! The street will be CROWDED, but don't worry, it's quite safe! The only con to staying here is that there isn't anyone on staff that speaks good English. However, with patience and kindness, you can work through those barriers and get whatever you need in the hotel. Asking for directions to get to an attraction was tough. I relied on google and the tourist app from the Japanese tourism bureau for subway directions. For that reason, when I do return, I would stay at an American hotel. However, that's not to say that this is not a good place to stay. I hope, with the Olympics in Tokyo next year, they will bring onboard staff that speak good English.","Phoenix, Arizona","Tygar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",24,5.0

I have stayed at this hotel 6 or 7 times in the past 10 years so maybe I am a stickler for pain? But the hotel, like any other, can be pleasant if you know what to expect.Over the years, I learned some lessons the hard way and would like to share some ways to avoid the hassles, in general and in specific to Sunshine Prince.1. This hotel caters to a lot of tour groups and I mean A LOT! That means check-in or check-out could be horrendous, so you should plan your ins and outs to avoid the groups. Avoid trying to check-out the hour before 11am, or check out at 2-3pm, which is when the tour groups are on the move.2. Request for a high floor room, 25th-37th floors as there are exclusive elevators serving only those floors (better if you are at 33 and above, as 1 elevator is exclusively 33-37 only). The other 4 elevators are shared by the rest serving ALL floors which means it is always crowded esp around check-in, check-out and dining hours!The lower floors are where the tour groups are accommodated.3. The 'air-con' is a central air-conditioning feed which means you CANNOT control individual room temperatures! You can only control the volume of air that goes into your room i.e. low, medium or high, which unfortunately doesn't make much difference.4. To keep the air 'fresh' in your room, the hotel provides a plasma ion humidifier/dehumidifier, which technically will freshen the air in your room with the release of negative ions. But a BIG warning here, some of the plasma ion machines seem to have not been maintained in a long time and the air filters are clogged with dust. If this is the case, it will emit bad air and smell into your room. DEMAND that it be changed with a clean unit IMMEDIATELY. You might suffer from breathing the re-circulating air from the unit instead. It is a major cause of the funny smell you get in hotel room.5. Make friends with the housekeeping staff on your floor. They are real nice people and you can get stuff like new towels, refreshments like water and coffee refills more easily than trying to call the housekeeping dept or reception.6. The breakfast option is expensive. It will be cheaper to have a comparable breakfast at the shops just outside the hotel.7. If you are coming in by the Airport Limousine Bus, (not the cheapest but most convenient method as it stops at this hotel), AND if you intend to leave by the same Airport Limousine Bus service within 14 days, it will save you money by buying a RETURN ticket instead of One-way to the hotel and then buying a new ticket back to the airport at the end of your stay. But this works only if you are travelling in pairs.A 14-day return ticket cost Y8000 for 2 paxs, whereas one way tickets will cost Y3100 each person each way, meaning you would pay a total of Y12,200 instead of Y8000. These are just some points, I could go on but I'll just leave you with these street smart tips for now.","Singapore, Singapore","hjtann</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",17,4.0

We arrived in Tokyo pretty late at night and wanted a hotel that wouldn't be too far of a walk. Since the Sunshine City Prince is one of the only 3 stops for the Limousine Bus in Ikebukuro (the other two being Hotel Metropolitan and Ikebukuro Station), we decided to book this hotel.I have three main issues with this hotel:1. The elevator situation.Since this hotel is used by a lot of tour groups, the elevators are absolutely horrible. There is a total of 6 elevators, but 2 are designated for the ""upper"" floors. If you are planning on leaving your room anytime between 6:30 AM until 11:00 AM (checkout time), be prepared to be packed into an elevator in a situation that rivals rush hour on the trains. Although we were in a higher room, the separate elevators made little to no difference. We were packed into elevators with other hotel guests (who were not even staying on the higher floors) traveling in the OPPOSITE direction just because that's how slow and packed the elevators were. In all the hotels I've stayed in, they've all had sensors in their elevators to make sure that hotel guests were only allowed to visit the floors that they stayed in! This is also a security concern that the hotel should take seriously. Hotel guests should not be allowed to visit any floor that they choose.2. Cleanliness of the rooms.At first glance, the rooms look clean. But when my boyfriend and I checked into our room, there were hairs in the bathroom, around the toilet and inside the tub. On our last day, we found a roach running around under the beds. I've never seen a roach running around on the sidewalks of Tokyo or even in the dirtiest of restaurants... For there to be a roach on an upper floor of a ""newly renovated"" hotel, was beyond disgusting to me. I wouldn't want to see how the lower floors look like.3. Customer service.On our last day, my boyfriend and I asked the front desk staff upon checking out if it would be possible to hold our bags for a few hours. They said they could, but directed us to the Bell Captain's desk across the lobby. Once we waited for the gentleman working at the desk to finish with his first customer, he told us we had to first purchase a ticket for the Limousine Bus. We figured this was normal practice, so we went to purchase our ticket from the Limousine Bus desk and returned a few minutes later. A lady named ""蒲田"" proceeded to take our suitcases and told us she was going to take it outside. She spoke little to no English and made no attempt to explain what she was doing with our suitcases. I asked for an English speaker, and the same man from before came to help us. He tried to explain that they store all of the suitcases for customers traveling on the Limousine Bus outside. He also tried to tell us that it was ""more convenient"" because our bags would be automatically loaded onto the bus for us. I've traveled many times with the Limousine Bus and I'm well aware that this is convenient for some customers, but since my boyfriend and I were planning on shopping a bit before our departure, we wanted to be able to repack our bags before inside the hotel, not outside on the sidewalk. I tried to explain this to the male staff, but he didn't seem to understand or care. I even told him that we had been staying at the hotel, since they were able to store other people's luggage directly behind the Bell Captain's desk. But after much debate and confirming that he would not keep our bags outside, we handed our suitcases over and watched as he wheeled them outside... This was the last straw. Once my boyfriend and I returned to pick up our bags, we kept on getting dirty glares from the Japanese-speaking ""蒲田' and felt completely unwelcome even though we had been staying at this hotel for the past few days.I do not recommend this hotel at all. There are many other hotels around the Ikebukuro area that are cheaper, cleaner and have kinder staff than the Sunshine City Prince.","Honolulu, Hawaii","potatochippu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,1.0

If you are staying on the lower floors floors, you need to plan well in advance to get to the lobby. In most cases, when the elevator stops on your floor, it's too full to get on. This year I noticed they added another express elevator, but it hasn't made any difference that I can notice.

I chose this hotel simply because they have the Airport Limousine Bus right at their front door. 24-hours supermarket and lots of restaurants around. Not busy as Shinjuku area but still has several big departments store for shopper.I made the booking directly with Sunshine City Prince Hotel. Their reservation department is very helpful and always replies my emails on time. They even gave us therir SeiBu Prince Club member's discount before we checked in. We (4 adults) booked 2 City-Twin Room Type C rooms for 4 nights. We didn't book their Panorama-Fourth Room because it was quite expensive for 4 adults. We stayed there from 16/01 to 20/01 in Room #1627 & 1628. Two rooms look the same but #1627 is a bit smaller than 1628. As this hotel has a lot of tourist groups so the lifts are always busy especially in the morning.Airport Limousine Bus has a counter on the ground floor too. Better to book your return bus to the airport (Haneda or Narita) once you have checked in to secure your seat. Family Mart (convenient store) is on the ground floor. Easy to go to the Ikebukuro Station(池袋) & Higashi-ikebukuro (東池袋)。We had a wonderful stay there. Reception staffs are nice, friendly and helpful. As a SeiBu Prince Club member, we got a free English newspaper every morning. If you choose for not cleaning your room for a day (maximum 2 days per room), the hotel will offer you one $500 Yen voucher to use in their restaurants. We save $2000 Yen all together and we spent it to buy their desserts at Cafe & Dining Chef’s Palette the night before we checked out. Really delicious and it's a good way to end our stay there. Strongly recommend this hotel for those who travel with young children or elderly especially for first time travellers to Tokyo unless you don't want to meet tourist groups. Be aware of their room size is quite small. We definitely will stay there if we can organixe another trip to Tokyo again.","Auckland, New Zealand","Sarahliu88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",14,5.0

I was told by my friend lately that they had a renovation recently and the rooms are much better now. Therefore, we choose to stay with them again this time from 17-21Jan19 and while making the booking with our travel agency, we emphasised to have a room in the newly renovated floor. We booked for a twin room with breakfast for two and the total amount we paid was HKD6000 for four nights. (HKD1500 per night). While checking in at the reception, I asked if the room assigned to us is newly renovated and the answer was YES. We were given room 916 and when we opened the door for our room, we were so disappointed as only the wallpaper and the carpet which I believe are renovated but not all the furniture and everything inside the toilet. The room, being a twin, is considered as extremely small and all the furniture are being squeezed into the room not in the appropriate positions. To make the situation even worse, we found a strong smell of urine from the toilet and the smell doesn’t go away even after flushing for a few times. There are also stains around the rims of the washing basin which looks quite dirty.Dirts/black spots are found all over the toilet mirror because of it’s long service inside the bathroom. Moreover, the air-condition unit is as what it was 20 years ago and the room was actually a bit hot even if we turned to ‘high’. The plug for chargers is strangely built in on one side of the wooden desk next to the bed and is difficult to place or hold the cellphone when charging with a short cord.The so-called wardrobe is only 1 foot away from one of the bed and the door was hardly to be opened if you stand in front of it. The TV set is placed on the desk which is on the left side of the two beds, definitely not a considerate or ideal position for watching TV from the beds. The walls are so ‘thin’ that I can hear clearly the talking from people next door at nighttime and the noises made by people from the upper floor as well.As our schedules were so tight and we left the hotel every morning after breakfast and return to the hotel at around 2100-2200. I really hate to waste my time wrestling with their management and to hear all those excuses that I don’t want to hear if I raise a complaint to the front desk. Because they will certainly have a different definition of ‘newly renovated’. Also, I don’t want to hold up my friends traveling with us and staying on the same floor. I therefore sent my complaint to the hotel group on the second day via the website they provided for inviting comments. However, I received no reply from anyone till my departure day and neither did anyone approach me about the complaint.Not sure if it is because the money that I paid was not enough to enjoy a real renovated room, if so, the front desk staff should have told me instead of telling me that it is a newly renovated room. To reflect more on this incident, two of my friends traveling with us and stayed in room 914 have extended their stay for two more days (till 23Jan) with lower room rate at around HKD1100 but without breakfast, and they were offered a room at 36 floor for the two extra days and which is fully renovated and with a much better view. In other words, the money we paid should be enough to enjoy the same even with breakfast.Anyhow, HKD1500 for a room with strong urine smell is just too expensive. I feel like being cheated and I decided to punish them by not staying with their hotel group anymore in the future. Also, I’m going to share this experience with my friends who are traveling a lot to Japan.","Hong Kong, China","WongManKong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",13,1.0

We were a group of over 30 people and they gave us rooms at the same floor in order to be together. We arrived before the check-in time so they took care of our luggage until we could check-in, and they made it very quickly. The room was quite large to be a Japanese hotel, there were even a desk, a tv and some space to put the luggage and move in a comfort way. Towels, slippers and dressing gown were changed every day and in the bathroom you could find toothbrush, razor, comb, hairdryer and big flacons of soap, shampoo and gel douche. The bed was very comfortable and you have all the light switches near it. The service was excellent, very kind and always ready to solve your problems. The waiters in the breakfast room bring you personally to your table and the receptionists are very quick to help you and to do the ordinary work. The breakfast buffet was huge and with a great variety of sweet and salt food. What makes this hotel greater than it seems is its position, it is directly connected to a huge mall with lots of shops and restaurants and its district is full of arcade game, pubs, shops and lots of different kind of great restaurants. There's a subway station underneath the hotel and another one, which is bigger and has more lines linked, just 5 minutes walk away and both of them are just a few stations away from the most important districts of Tokyo, like Shinjuko, Akihabara, Asakusa, etc.In conclusion it was a great and comfortable stay in a hotel where people is very kind and helpful and were you can easily enjoy not only the neighborhood but also the most famous districts of Tokyo.","Collecchio, Italy","Marcopesk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Collecchio, Italy</strong>",15,4.0

Rooms were small but otherwise acceptable - it is Japan. Full amenities provided, good views of the city, conveniently linked to a large shopping mall. If you want to use the toilet, there's a huge step to climb into it, for some reason. Lifts were chaotic at dinner time - we had to queue to get into an elevator, and no staff were around to help usher guests where a giant line blocked the entire entrance to the lift areas.Here is why my entire family checked out the very next day with a full refund, and went back to Metropolitan hotel in Ikebukuro (we've stayed there prior to another part of our Tokyo trip). 1) Staff have 0 initiative. Upon entering the lobby, no one stepped forward to help us with any of our luggage, or offered to ask us how they can help us. Upon speaking to someone, she flatly told us what time check in is (we knew we were early) and did not offer us any alternative. Don't wait for the guest to ask for early check in, or where they can store their bags while waiting, or that you actually have a guest lounge - take initiative. You might even earn some money for us choosing to do an early check in. 2) Rooms were DISGUSTINGLY, relentlessly warm. The fact that they used a centralised air conditioning/heating system (a very money-saving technique) is not stated ANYWHERE in the hotel information - only that air con is a part of their facilities. I beg to differ on their definition of air conditioning. We were extremely uncomfortable and the rooms had 0 air circulation even when staff came to adjust the fan. The manager who assisted in moving me (Watanabe) to another room, was sweating himself! 3) Murakami personally handled our issues with the a/c. He insisted the rooms were 'much cooler' despite us showing him the temperature in the actual room. He insisted that there were absolutely no other rooms available as the hotel was fully booked. He insisted there were no fans left in the hotel. Twenty minutes later, a fan turned up. An hour later, we showed management a whole two pages of available rooms found on Agoda and Booking.com. Murakami decided not see us any further, and threw his assistant manager, Watanabe, under the bus to deal with us and to help me move from one to another supposedly 'cooler' room. 4) Me and my sister woke up sick the next day - sweating in said rooms. Tokyo's temperature? 0 degrees. Sunshine City Prince Hotels' room temperature? 25 degrees. Both me and my sister fell violently ill, ran a fever, had intense nausea and we had no alternative but to check out immediately. We got a full refund, and had to move back to Metropolitan hotel, where the hotel staff immediately took all our luggage for us, sent me to a clinic nearby after finding us an English-speaking clinic, ensured all our rooms were beautifully cool and comfortable for an early check in so we could all recuperate. Sunshine City Prince Hotel did not even bother to help us find a cab when we left. Not one staff helped us take our altogether seven pieces of luggage out to the taxi line or even asked if they could assist us any further after issuing us refunds and a check out.Is it a good hotel? Probably. If you engaged a tour group, you'll probably end up here in a crowded, chaotic, noisy lobby with staff that look presentable but do nothing else for you. Is it a hotel I would return to ever again in my lifetime? Not a single probability.","Singapore, Singapore","wenny y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",23,2.0

Rooms were clean, well equipped and so was the toilet. Request for a high floor and we were put on the ""Prince"" levels which were really so much better especially when there was a special lift that served only levels 33 to 37. So it was really great to take the express elevator. Convenience store was located on level 1 which was wonderful to buy most stuff. The shopping complex just beside the hotel was pretty large though shops closed at 8pm sharp except for the restaurants on level 3. Only 2 in a room so kids were in the room next door. So family or no family, only 2 in a room max. Wheelchairs would find it a problem to get into the rooms as the corridor in the room after the door could only fit one and a half of me standing abreast (at best, maybe less). Certainly it wouldn't fit me and my luggage beside me as I had to push it in front of me and opening the door was an issue when coming out So it wouldn't fit a wheelchair.","Singapore, Singapore","alvinwylee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",15,5.0

Room was efficient, and since this was my 1st time in Japan, the bathroom/toilet was quite an experience! There was only one English-speaking TV channel, however, that I could find, a news/event channel, I believe. Bed was comfortable. The worst part of staying here, and it was an issue, is that the AC is not adjustable. I like it cool, as in 68 degrees F or lower, and it must have been 75 or higher the whole time! If I were not with a group, I would have considered another place, unless this is typical of Japanese hotels. It was explained to me that Asian body temp is warmer than Caucasion's (by a Japanese tour guide).

Next, we were very surprised to learn that there's a amenity kit being prepared for my child. Also, there's a 24 hour big Family mart convenient store and shopping mall attached to the hotel which makes is so easy. There's also a limo bus counter located at the ground floor of the hotel too, for easy reach to Narita and Haneda airport. I have last stayed in this hotel 10 years ago, this is my 2nd time.

The hotel also provide a bus limousine to take us to the airport (Haneda/Narita) which is handy as we don't have to carry our luggage and simply wait for the bus to arrive in front of the hotel. The only negative experience for us, the hotel was not a quite place as we would love to be and the wall quite thin. On the first night we can hear our neighbour turn on a music quite loud until midnight and there was another incident where the guest next door (different person) decide to have a conference early in the morning (around 4-5am in the morning) and talking so loud.

It is either I accept a lower grade room or I must check out and check in again. I asked to extend my check out time for 1 hour. They denied me again. They said not possible and I have to pay 1 hour 1,000 yen. I guess this hotel is not doing hospitality business. They are solely into just renting out rooms. Customers satisfaction, convenience and needs are not important at all to them. If I'm in HK, Taiwan, Singapore, China or Korea. This will not happen to me. Travelling close to 12 hours and encountered this type of check-in experience, life really suck. The trip is already a bad head start. I still have 5 more days to endure here.

All you can do is adjust the fan speed in the room, windows do not open. It was too hot to comfortably sleep one night, likely as it had been a sunny day and we were on the top floor. We complained and they gave us a portable cooling fan which helped but even our local friends thought it was strange. Apparently they monitor the hallway temperature but that doesn’t allow for a small enclosed room after a couple of hot showers!

There is a direct bus service from Narita and Haneda Airport, the shopping mall is downstairs, the rooms are very slightly bigger than rival hotels in the vicinity, the 24-h supermarket is just outside the shopping mall, Sunshine 60-dori is abundant, and the number of train lines above and below ground at Ikebukuro is way too convenient for you to get to places within and outside Tokyo city. Saitama prefecture is just above this neighbourhood as well.Service in this hotel is acceptable - ask and assistance would be given, and they'll do a decent job for you. If you don't ask, they pretty much would leave you to your own devices.I never have issues with the bed and pillows, but perhaps due to age or a change of furniture due to renewal (renovation), this time round I wake up daily with slight aches. Hmmm.My only gripe is the level of stuffiness in the rooms and you can't do much to the air-conditioning. I think this was the case before renewal (renovation), but after renewal, it seemed to have gotten worse. This applies regardless of room size and the number of occupants within. If you don't have a strong throat, you sneeze easily, or if you're travelling with someone who may catch a flu along the way, good luck - the lack of air circulation and the high level of humidity may affect you.Do your research on when the hotel gets really crowded - the waiting time for lifts and the FamilyMart convenience store can be long.I would consider staying here again next year if the bed, air circulation and conditioning issues be addressed and improved.To all who are travelling to Tokyo for the first time and looking to get an overall good impression of the city, this accommodation might be it.",,DarrylS750,2,4.0

Our 2 rooms were for the twin Type C configuration on the 10th floor. The Prince Hotel was very easy to get to from Narita airport. We took the airport limo ($3100 yen pp) which dropped us off directly in front of the hotel in about 2 hours. Check-in went very smoothly without any issues. Our side by side rooms consisted of 2 twin size beds that were configured end to end and separated by a 3 foot high wall. The beds were very firm and 2 pillows were provided per bed. The room had a small desk, a small refrigerator, a small closet area (in one of the 2 rooms), a safe (one was not working in one of our rooms), and a cell phone which you could use for free (indoor and outdoor) during your stay at the hotel. The TV was approximately 32” with just one station that broadcasted in English (NHK). The bathroom had a small counter and a combo shower/tub. Water pressure was very good as was the water temperature. Climate control for the room was somewhat limited. There was no way to turn the AC up any higher, however the room never felt too hot or stuffy. Wi-Fi was excellent; we were always able to connect to the internet and experienced no dropped connections while we were there. Although the hotel has a number of restaurants, we never tried any of them and instead ate at the restaurants at the Sunshine Mall (4th floor). There is also a currency exchange machine in the lobby. The indoor mall is connected to the hotel and has an impressive array of stores in addition to an aquarium, observatory, planetarium, and 2 themed areas Nanjatown and J-World. There is also a Food-Mart and mini supermarket which were great sources for picking up bottled water, inexpensive food, and other household items. The mall leads into the outdoor Sunshine City Strip (very busy/crowded) which again has many stores, eating establishments, and really fun game arcades. At the end of the strip is Ikebukuro train station where you can catch both the Metro and JR trains. Although I found our rooms a tiny bit cramped, I think all the amenities, i.e. location, mall, restaurants, proximity to subway station, and easy transfer to and from the airport more than made up for that. I highly recommend the Sunshine City Prince Hotel and I would not hesitate staying there again when I return to Tokyo one day.","South San Francisco, California","Nathan C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South San Francisco, California</strong>",14,5.0

I wanted to stay in the Sunshine City area moreso we came from the Kansai region of Japan and we wanted to immediately settle in our hotel to prepare for the next days' trips. So easy to stay here coz the Ikebukuro Station is just a walking distance. Not very near but a good, easy walk along a nice shopping area to the hotel. Plus the Sunshine Road (on the way from Ikebukuro Station to the hotel) is a pedestrian only road so no problem in taking your luggage to the hotel. The hotel's staff were also very helpful and accommodating. Our room was ready when we checked in at about midnight after a Shinkansen trip from Nagoya. Ikebukuro Sunshine City bus terminal is also just behind the hotel so it was very convenient if you're taking the bus to and from anywhere outside Tokyo. There are so many restaurants and entertainment centers around. The biggest anime department store is also located here in Sunshine City Ikebukuro. So anime fans would have a ball staying here in this area. With the Ikebukuro Station just near, you can take the JR Yamanote Line which circles around Tokyo. You can even design your own tour. Just google and you're good to go! Some tours also pick up participating travelers from Prince Hotel so very convenient for the traveler. Even airport limo buses originating from either Narita or Haneda have drop off/pick up points in SC Prince Hotel. Very convenient indeed. As for food, I say you can go east or west of Ikebukuro Station and find both Michelin and regular restos here. There's Ippudo and Mutikiya on the west side. Some unknown to us but still very good food they have. Even the regular restos would offer you the best quality food. The Japanese are known for their high quality foods served in even the regular restos. Go adventure and you'll not regret it. They also help you in booking for your airport limo buses to Narita or Haneda which we took. Our 4D/3N stay wasn't enough! By the way, there's also a quite big supermart just across the hotel.

(Yes, the room walls of our room were absolutely blank.)WARNING: Many of the rooms are ridiculously, ridiculously, ridiculously small unless you demand – DEMAND and refuse to leave – a normal – sized room. The room we initially got was only as wide as fingertip to fingertip, and it contained a double bed. Apparently, there are six different categories of room sizes here. Be sure you’ve gotten one that will allow you to inhale, exhale, and turn around. NO KIDDING. You can’t count on those things at this ridiculous hotel. It would be preferable to stay in one of those novelty Japanese “capsule” hotels, so at least you wouldn’t have to pay the regular hotel rates they charge here, and you would have an amusing experience about which to tell your friends....The bathrooms also were incredibly small and stripped down and, as my husband observed, probably pre-– fab. They were about the size of the facilities on an airplane, and they were about as lovely and comfortable. There was a lip on the edge of the bathroom on which you easily could trip and fall in the middle of the night – very dangerous. The safe was so small that an iPad wouldn’t fit in. The walls were thin and you could hear everything. There were minimal amenities, no coffee, and the towels were fraying. They gave us four – count ‘em, four! – hangers on which to hang our clothes. The elevators are a nightmare – they only ran two out of six even though they were totally packed for this 38- floor hotel at 8a.m.:. Do not stay here.","Sacramento, California","SacAnnie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",101,1.0

The beds were Japanese-typically hard, with pillows to match. Staff was good about bringing softer pillows. The dinner choices after a 14 hour flight to Tokyo left a lot to be desired. And too expensive. The breakfast buffet was only so-so. Great variety of Japanese and Western choices, but nothing was hot except the Miso soup. Saving grace was the good coffee! Location was good - within walking distance of some great sights and certainly subway accessible. Attached Sunshine City Shopping Mall was great with a lot of choices, both for shopping and eating.Be ready for a jam-packed lobby every morning as the day's travel tours depart.

Large reception area but with no atmosphere. Had to ask if our cases could be taken to our room as no attempt was made to take them for us. We were given a room on the 16th floor which was actually a single but had two single beds squeezed in by placing the beds together headboard to headboard which left a small corridor approximately 2 foot wide which you had to use to store your cases as no cupboards or wardrobe. You had to walk over your cases to get to the beds and only one person at a time. Ridiculous!! There was a small rail on the wall with 3/4 hangers should you wish to use them. The air con was not working properly and you were unable to open the window making it uncomfortable to sleep in. No bottled water offered in the room. Bathroom was a decent size which confirmed to us that this was indeed a single room and if had one single bed this would have been sufficient for a lone person and the hotel could have furnished it properly. As we were a couple this room was really not suitable for two people. This room could only be described as a box room. One bed was like sleeping on a board. The buffet breakfast had a very good variety but it was so busy you had difficulty getting a table so my advice is to try and go after 9 but you risk not having the food replenished as they stop serving at 10am. We did ask to change the room but informed this was not possible. We did speak with another couple who managed to get a room on the 36th floor which was a normal double. So try and get a room on the higher floors. No English speaking tour desk so not able to arrange tours. My advice would be to use another hotel with better amenities as this hotel only has a convenience shop, coffee shop and restaurant. Not impressed.

As I preferred staying along I had to pay S$600 extra for 7 days stay. I have been thinking “Prince Hotel” is a high end hotel but after staying here and the quality I should say it is a quite ordinary hotel with lots to be improved. This may not apply for other Prince Hotels. This hotel seemed to me mainly for foreigners from Asian countries (Chinese, Korean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean, Vietnamese et all). You can enjoy hearing all sorts of languages spoken there.As I never thought of writing a review on this hotel I did not take photos. But I would like to say certain things for those who wish to stay this hotel.Good points: 1. Airport shuttle bus service is available both from Narita Airport and Haneda Airport.2. Connected to the big Shopping centre with all kinds of shops including lots of restaurants from ordinary ones to high end, and also amusement facilities like aquarium etc.3. Helpful staffBad points:1. Bathtub was not clean; I notices dirt in the wall of bathtub when I wanted to dip myself in hot water in the tub. Therefore I asked the front to clean. After two days again the similar dirt was found. This shows they do not scrub the tub wall every day.2. No writing pad in the room3. Too crowded during morning breakfast. Then everyday same items. This is a bit too much for those who stay more than a week.4. We were caught in morning rush hour elevator. It took almost 30 minutes to get in for checking out. That too after calling the front desk frantically.5. A bit far away from train/metro stations.6.

There was a small wardrobe but trying to place 2 suitcases out was challenging. Buffet Breakfast choice was fairly good if you got there before the rush, people had to queue. Breakfast restaurant not big enough for size of hotel. There were 6 lifts but had to wait at least 10 minutes to get in one at peak times. The trick is to catch one going up if space as the fill up coming down.Being attached to shopping mall is good and large 24 hour supermarket across the street.WiFi speed quite good.On our last night in Japan we came back to this hotel and got a room upgrade as our allocated room was right opposite the lifts/elevators.

The room was clean, with many amenities including a courtesy smart phone.

Most of the stuff does not speak english but try to help. They supply purified water to the coffee cattle, but it was not done every day.The Yamanoto JR line takes you to the attractions of Shibuya, Shinjuku and many other places around that circular line.","Tel Aviv, Israel","Gai M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",121,4.0

And also to catch up with local friends.Couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay!I usually stay Shinjuku and Akasaka area but Ikebukuro was vibrant and full of amenities and things to do.Landed early into Haneda and check in strictly adhered to for 2pm (as usual for Japan). So dropped off my luggage and explored the area.Reception was friendly and also wisely cautioned me from going too early to Shinjuku as the trains would be packed until after 10am.It was quite pleasant to walk around the area and look at the thousands upon thousands of office workers streaming to work. Managed to see a few places open for breakfast but caved in and walked into a Starbucks for coffee.Came back at 2pm to check in and was swiftly processed.Room is compact but functional and very clean. I was given a renovated room with a double bed on the panorama floor and what a view! Could stare at it all day till night!The hotel seemed to have rectified the ventilation system and also had a cooling humidifier placed in the room. So no issues with too stuffy rooms.Definitely can open up my huge luggage with ease but maybe because I was on my own. Can be a little squeezy with two persons in it.Hotel had a Family Mart convenient store in lobby level and that was extremely helpful.Airport bus limousine from Haneda also dropped and picked up right at the hotel.Hotel was linked up to the massive Sunshine City shopping mall and was an easy 10-15min walk above ground through much shopping and restaurants to the train station.Tokyu Hands, Seibu, Tobu department stores all nearby. I counted at least 3 Bic Cameras in the area and more than 15 pharmacies selling beauty products etc.Ikebukuro is only one stop from Shinjuku so that wasn’t a problem if I wanted to get out of the area. Highly recommend the hotel. Staff were friendly and efficient! Stay was comfortable. Extreme value for money in my opinion!

The expensive room you have a table and sofa instead with branded shampoo and body wash and obviously being at a higher level amazing views of tokyo (ikebukuro) both day and night views!The best thing about the hotel is that it is connected to Sunshine city shopping centre so (be aware later time this entrance is closed), the other good thing is outside of the hotel you have 24hr Seiyu which is like a huge convenient store great for late night snacking and sweets for gifts!You can also purchase airport bus tickets from the hotel at the reception and you just wait outside.The hotel is quite a walk from the main Ikebukuro station roughly 10-15mins but you are surrounded by so many restaurants and shops! Also many arcades which i loved the most!I would recommend this hotel if you are looking to stay somewhere connected on the JR line, quite central and bustling area but the hotel is far enough to be quiet.

I'm going to start with the negatives in case any of them are deal breakers. Storage: there are no drawers or closets. Our second time we did have four hangers for jackets but that's about it. Plan to keep your clothes in your luggage. Trash: This is kind of a weird negative, but the trash can they provide you is incredibly tiny. For all the bottles of water we were chugging and the onigir wrappers from breakfast we constantly have extra bags stacked around the can for housekeeping to collect. Temperature: it is incredibly warm in this hotel. Granted, most buildings in Japan are, but even staying here in the winter we were constantly sweating. They provide you with a humidifier than can run on just fan mode and there's a switch on the wall for a fan but even with those blasting 24/7 and the shade always down, it was incredibly warm (my normally hard shea butter was liquid). We bought ice to put in front of the fan and pretty much stayed naked whenever we were in our rooms. Also there is no ice machine so plan to purchase ice from the konbini. This is probably the biggest issue I have with the hotel. That all said, this hotel is so convenient. Being attached to such a large mall means you can get almost anything without even stepping outside. Book stores, clothes, candy, restaurants, toys. We buy a lot when we go to Japan and so it's great to have such access to so many stores. The ikebukuro station is also fairly close. It took us a couple days to realize that you can do a lot of walking underground. On the first floor you can walk a bit and come out near Tokyo Hands. Then a little bit past that take the entrance to Tokyo Metro. Even if you're using JR that passage will connect eventually. It's a lot quicker and great for when it's freezing out. Another convenience is the konbini on the first floor. We bought from there almost twice a day for our week stay. Too tired to eat at a restaurant? Konbini food! Blisters from walking? Bandages at the konbini! End up with tonsilities(my poor husband)? Masks at the konbini! Friends back home want to try weird kitkats? Konbini! Can't find something but see it on Amazon? Order it and have it delivered to the konbini! For us, the convenience of this hotel makes the negatives worth it. ",,mrspaprika,1,4.0

So suitcases lie on the floor, occupying an already minimal free space.Cramped incredible.

The room itself was not very large, but this being Tokyo and for the price I paid I thought it was quite reasonable and being out sightseeing all day, all I needed was a safe and clean place to sleep at night. The only drawback I might mention is the lack of any cupboard/shelf/ drawers where one can put some clothing. There is a clothes rack with some hangers, but most of the clothes I had didn’t require hanging. The lack of any wardrobe space meant that all my clothes had to stay in my suitcase for the duration of my stay. Apart from that and considering my stay was for only 4 nights, this didn’t bother me too much. Check in and check out process was smooth and the staff were friendly and helpful.

This was my best experience so far. I choose this place for a few reasons. it is located next to a shopping mall and very close to the Sega/St Tropez arcades which I still love going to 20 years later! The bus from the airport stops here. Also Ikebukuro station is useful for access to everywhere in Tokyo.The online price was very good as I booked way in advance.The check in process was easy. The guy spoke decent English (my Japanese is terrible). As I had booked on their website and signed up to the member program I was offered free breakfast. He also lent me a USB charger for my phone which was super handy as I was ill prepared. The room I was given was on the top floor - 37. There is a lift that services the top few floors only which is a nice touch. 37 can be accessed from the other lifts also and they are pretty efficient.Obviously as with all of Tokyo the room was pretty compact. I have stayed in smaller though. The room has been renovated since my last visit and had a great view. There isn't any storage but they have some hooks on the wall with about 4 hangers. There was a Nespresso machine and kettle, free water. The bathroom was big enough, every free item you could think of. Comb, brush, toothbrush, hair tie, razor etc. Plus free slippers!! Good hairdryer!! I didn't see a control for the air con. It wasn't too bad but may be an issue in the hot summer.Breakfast was interesting. They have the usual continental options but also bacon and eggs, salad, pasta and fries! I tried a few of the Japanese options also which were very nice. There is a Family Mart on the bottom floor which is open 24 hours. Unlike the usual hotel shops, they don't inflate the prices here. Great range. There is also an ATM here which accepts overseas cards. Min 10,000 yen withdrawal.If you are coming from Ikebukuro Station take exit 35 for the hotel and follow signs for Sunshine City. I usually take the escalator down next to Tokyu Hands and follow the signs for the hotel. I don't actually know the other way but I dare say you cannot miss the building!! It is the white building next to the huge one. The mall is great for shopping, aquarium, Namja Town. Lots of food options from 11am-10pm. Nearby is Seibu department store, check out the cake section on the bottom floor (can access from station).

There is a small convenience shop just inside which is quite useful. The hotel, like most I saw in Japan was clean and efficient, the staff were courteous and helpful. Our room was on the 24th floor - I must admit to taking a step back when I opened the curtains. It was a long way down and there was no balcony or ledge. The room was small but adequate with dressing gowns, slippers, hairbrush, toothbrush, razor a kettle and a fridge, green tea was provided but no coffee. The bathroom was typical Japanese 'pod' style about 4' square but at 6'2"" I found it OK if a little cosy. Beds a little hard but again OK, pillows which for us are always an issue were a little on the firm side. Irons and ironing boards along with the ubiquitous vending machines were available on each floor. The rooms have little storage space and only a small hanging rail. There are free safes in the room and the free WiFi is quite reliable, air-con was passable but could be an issue in hotter weather 22c for us. Don't know about the TV as it was never turned on. The buffet evening meal provided a good range of options - not surprisingly mostly with an oriental twist. Breakfast was also buffet style, the restaurant can get busy at peak times but was not really a problem. The main issue was that the hot food wasn't - lukewarm at best unless you had an omelette. Coffee machines were also a bit slow. As a transit hotel it was fine, comfortable enough with most facilities and easy access to Tokyo, it is not a place to stay more than a few days in my opinion, built for speed rather than comfort.","Peterborough, United Kingdom","dogearred</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peterborough, United Kingdom</strong>",81,4.0

We considered staying near Tokyo Station but we had already spent time in Tokyo in the past and also had a weekend in Tokyo planned prior to our departure. The train from the airport was easy, but the train station is so massive that even though we had researched the walk from the station to the hotel it was late, confusing (we exited on the wrong side of the station and had to walk around), and took a little figuring out. Finally, we found an entrance to the mall. On the positive side, our kids loved walking through Sunshine City at night (child said ""this is just what I imagined Tokyo to be like"" when we passed the Sega store...). The mall is massive and instead of walking through the mall we could have probably gone a block or so and crossed and been at the hotel entrance, but live and learn.Check-in was very efficient. The room was on a high floor (no need to check out the observation tower!) with a fantastic view. While there was a tour group waiting to check-in we were helped very quickly.One of the reasons why we selected this hotel (beyond access to Pokémon) was that it slept four people (which is rare in Japan). We had a corner room. To the right there was a mini refrigerator, mini-freezer, an electric teapot, and a variety of amenities. There was also a long couch, coffee table, and flat screen TV. To the left was a luggage storage area, toilet room (awesome Japanese toilet!), and a bath room with an enclosed wet room including a very deep soaking tub (maybe the best ever) and then a dressing and getting ready area with a ton of amenities. In the corner was a separate enclosed room with four beds. This sleeping room was fantastic because it got very, very dark. The beds were twin sized but they could be pushed together if needed. Each bed had a night stand with reading lamp and again amenities were plentiful.We LOVED this hotel. My husband and daughter got up early and went across the street to Family Mart where they bought cup of noodles. They could sit in the TV area and make and eat their noodles while my son and I slept obliviously in the sleeping room. Each of us took a bath in the soaking tub which was incredibly refreshing. Regarding location; the mall has a variety of restaurants and the first night we were there we ate in a tonkatsu restaurant that everyone enjoyed. While waiting for the Pokémon store to open we also checked out Namja town and J-World and walked around the area. There are a ton of different anime and electronic stores and we wish we had more time to see them. Our train left from Ikebukuru station in the early afternoon. The Pokémon store was the main attraction and being able to stay right there and be at the biggest store was a huge hit with the family. So, yes, we chose our hotel because of proximity to the largest Pokémon store in the world.Family Mart (open 24 hours)","Seattle, Washington","Jetlager</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",92,5.0

It has gone downhill since Seibu emi took over the Prince Hotels. First, English language skills at front desk limited to none. Then, they refused to honor a breakfast offer for Seibu members which I received as an email. True: it required reservation to be made on their website, but this stipulation was in tiny print at the bottom of the email which barely printed. When I told them I didn't realize the requirement, showed them how this restriction appeared on the otherwise large font advertisement, they wouldn't make ANY accommodation. Room was even smaller (but same category) as last visit. No place to store clothes. No shelves. No nothing except a desk top. Four hangers for two people in miniature closet?Fourth, in breakfast buffet, the help was overwhelmed by number of guests. Tables left with dirty dishes the whole time we were there. No server offered coffee. Egg preparation chef was swamped and slow, so forget an omelette made to order. Even hard to get a fried egg. I tried twice. Always gone. Bottom line: don't stay here. It's not worth the headache, hassle, language barrier problems, unfriendly management. Oh. And I forgot. Lots of travel groups with children and adolescents running around at all hours.

The hotel has a direct limousine bus from both Narita and Haneda airports which is so convenient and negates carrying luggages up and down trains. The staff was polite and nice when checking in and helped bring our luggage up to our room. We took a high floor room which was located on their panaroma levels from 33th onwards and it was worth every penny. Fantastic view! Room was small of course but that's the way it is in Tokyo hotels. The 24hr Family Mart at the lobby was useful for amenities that we forgot to bring (hairspray, haha).And best, it's located next to Sunshine City with several entrances leading directly to the shopping complex itself so my parent can shop and eat to her heart's content without over-tiring her legs. Plenty of resting spots inside Sunshine City so it's great for seniors and children. There's an observatory and aquarium as well if you want to do some touristy things besides shopping and eating. The surrounding area, Ikebukuro, has tons of shops and eateries to explore too with the nearby Tobu and Seibu.Downside is if you want to use it as base for going to other parts of Tokyo, it is at least 15-18mins walk to Ikebukuro Station. You will need to walk out of Sunshine City (5mins), walk to an underground station tunnel (10mins) via Sunshine Doori street, and another 5mins or so to reach the actual station. Not really as near as said but Ikebukuro Station does have most of the major train lines needed to explore Tokyo. Another alternative which is slightly nearer is Higashi-Ikebukuro Station linked directly via an underground tunnel from Sunshine City and about 10-13mins walk. But only one line, Yurakucho Line, runs there and it does go directly to Shin-Kiba Station where you can switch to the Disneyland monorail. Despite the inconvenience to the train station, still recommended highly for Sunshine City, Ikebukuro, lovely staff and room view if you're high enough!","Singapore, Singapore","ShuHui73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",14,4.0

No wardrobe, but have small hanging space by the wall outside the bathroom. Always have 2 complimentary bottles of water, an electric kettle, and a coffee machine. Best part is it has direct shuttle bus to and from Narita and Haneda airports. If you signed up for Prince Emi Card (their membership card) during your stay, you can enjoy a bus ride to Hakone at 1000yen per person per one way, but do make the reservation at least 1 day in advanced, the bus counter opens between 7:00-20:00.","Hong Kong, China","Miss_Cukiee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",37,4.0

The mall has lots of restaurants, gift shops and entertainment options.The staff are friendly and accommodating despite the language barrier but are firm in enforcing the hotel's policies. The hotel lobby is spacious and modern while the rooms are a bit outdated. The room and bathroom were spacious by Japanese standards and was a welcome surprise. The mini ref was a bit too tiny and no free bottled water which I normally encounter in hotels of the same caliber. Bathroom water pressure was strong but sprinkler hose type shower head was a little bit difficult to maneuver as it would turn on its own when the shower was on. Buffet breakfast area had nice interiors and had a reasonable spread that everyone could choose from. If you don't get to catch breakfast, there is a Family Mart on the hotel's ground floor where you can buy a variety of hot and cold food as well as other goods and even souvenirs.There is a machine that can change $US to ¥ yen on the ground floor in case you need local currency right away. The nearest Metro station is not too near nor too far to walk to, but passing through the Ikebukuro shopping area made the walk less noticeable. The hotel is also serviced by the Airport Limousine Bus so that getting to and from the airport is hassle free. No need to use the train, unless you missed the bus which departs on an hourly schedule. I would definitely return to this hotel, especially to bring children, as the rooms is spacious and the mall next door has a planetarium and aquarium and other child friendly activities.

The great thing about this hotel is the fact that it is located/connected right next to the Sunshine City Alpa. Everything, and I mean EVERY thing that you could possibly want or need is right next door. There is a 24 hour mini-mart located within the hotel for all your necessities. The train station is less than a ten minute walk, what more could you ask for?Unfortunately, one of the biggest things I was silently asking for I did not get. It is Tokyo after all and space is at a premium. The room we got had zero space to move around and everything was cramped. You literally had to live out of your suitcase as there was no space to even set aside clothes to wear for the following day. The restrooms were also quite small and there was really no place to put your sundries or cosmetics or anything like that. One other thing that got to me as well was the fact that I could not adjust the airflow or thermostat. I mean, there was a switch but it was in Japanese and even though I played around with it, I noticed no change in air flow (minuscule) or temperature. Thankfully the weather was deliciously cold, it being Springtime and all but I wonder if it was different during the summer months.Otherwise, it was a pretty nice and clean place, inside and out. Breakfast was passable. Nothing great but not terrible either. The thing that made me say this hotel was average was that we got a good rate for it (about 25% off the normal price). If we had paid the true price, I don't think I would have been too happy.Bottom line: If you can get the rates for a very cheap price, do it.

Our visit was for our honeymoon, and the staff kindly upgraded us to the Panorama floor for free and left a really nice handwritten card in our room.The Panorama floor was amazing and the view was just spectacular. We even went up Tokyo Tower and felt our hotel view was better! The room and bathroom was also a great size, with good amenities like a sink outside the bathroom and a big couch along the wall to enjoy the view. Breakfast was great with both a Japanese and western section. The hotel provided bottles of water each day, and the laundry services were great (washer-dryer combo with soap for 500Y). It has a convenience store inside that's open 24/7 and sells most of the essentials (travel items, meals, snacks, drinks, alcohol, etc). The front desk can provide free umbrellas when it rains. Two things worth mentioning, though. First, there is a wide disparity between the different types of rooms. We walked through one of the lower floors for the laundry and the hallway was very outdated and seemed not nearly as nice as the Panorama floor. Second, it is a good 10-15 minute walk to the Ikebukuro train station, so maybe isn't the best pick if you're planning to do frequent journeys each day on the train or want to come back to the hotel often.

The row of sofa seats across an entire wall (with the windows) allowed our family members from other rooms to join us comfortably. What I liked about the bathroom facilities was that the wash basin is outside of the bathroom and toilet. In that way, the basin is accessible even though someone is taking a bath. The Shiseido toiletries were a treat. The little walk in wardrobe was well designed and could surprisingly hold a large luggage. One comment though, is that the bathroom is not level with the room floor. We had to take a step up of about half a foot to get in and step down when getting out. This may prove a little difficult for the elderly or less mobile. The hotel is connected to Sunshine City which is a large shopping mall with lots of food options. This was very convenient.

There is also what Japanese call a police box right as you walk out of the hotel passing the park along the way so I feel safe and I don't have to worry about anything when I stay out late because there are lots of policemen here and there looking out for people.

The desk staff has excellent English; the lobby has several Internet terminals; the location is wonderful. That said, the Sunshine Prince has several disadvantages. While it was bright shiny new in 1980, it is definitely showing its age. I suspect that the carpeting and bedding is original to 1980. Because its rates for standard rooms are fairly reasonable, it attracts huge tour groups, which can make the lobby and elevators a mob scene. BTW, some reviews complain of small rooms, but there are large Western-style rooms at the ends of the building. The major drawback is that there is no air-conditioning, and the windows do not open. There is a promising little knob on the wall labeled “airflow” and numbered one through five. As far as I can see, it does nothing but entertain you. At my most recent visit this April, I tried to avoid this problem by going for one of their premium rooms that goes for about $300 a night. While indeed luxurious, there is still the useless little dial instead of real air-conditioning.

Here is our review:Transport from Haneda Airport (#1): We took the Airport Limousine bus service from Haneda airport. The ride took about 30 minutes and the stop is right in front of the hotel. At the airport we went to the desk and the agent gave us a ticket and we then proceeded to wait at the stop that she told us.Checking in: No problems with checking in, since we was part of the tour group everything was ready for us. One unusual thing was the hotel card key had our room number and also the hotel name. We found this a little unnerving becasue if we lost our card key someone will know the hotel and room number. We did notice that when we checked in for our other room after the tour group, the card key was a regular one (without the room number) so maybe that is tour group thing. It looked like they had some new workers training so the person that was assisting us had some minor difficulties but the person that was assisting her stepped in and helped us.Lobby: It looks like the lobby area is being renovated but it was big enough to handle the crowds. Since this hotel is very popular with the tour groups it was pretty crowded when a group arrived. Elevators: The only complaint is when a tour group arrived and there was a mass number of people going to the rooms, there was a wait for the elevators. Plus some people would line up for the elevators while other people did not. Also one elevator is used for the panoramic floors which some guests did not notice the sign so that made it more confusing. Maybe it would be a good idea to have a staff member at the elevators when a group arrives so they can make sure everyone is in order.Room (#1): For the tour we was assigned a regular room and the size was small. After reading other reviews we understand this is a standard size in Tokyo, but after coming from the Prince Sakura Tower Tokyo where the size of the rooms are huge, it was a minor shock to see the size of this room. It took a lot of maneuvering but my wife and I was able to fit four suitcases and two hand carry bags in the room. The room had a desk on one side and a 20 inch tv and refrigerator which we used for drinks and snacks. The bathroom was a little small and there was a step up into the bathroom. The air conditioned was working at a low level even though it was at high. I noticed the room would get a little cold only after the ac was on for a while (couple hours).Room (#2): After the tour left we stayed one more night at the hotel. We reserved for one of the ""renovated, panoramic floor"" rooms. The room was nice, you could tell it was renovated but the size of the hotel was the same as the standard room. The difference is the bathroom was bigger because there was no closet (there was couple hangers hanging, which looked odd). Also in place of the desk there was a sofa and coffee table. The good thing is we could use the panoramic elevators. Amenities: For the tour we ate at the restaurants. The breakfast buffet was good, but after four days of eating the same thing I was glad to look for something else. We also had dinner which had Japanese items which was good. There is a Family Mart off the lobby which sold snacks and drinks plus other items. This was great to have this to buy items.Location: The best part is the hotel is located right next to the Sunshine Mall and entertainment complex. There are a number of stores and restaurants to go to. Ikebukuro Train station is about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel and you walk through one of the shopping streets with Uni Qlo and Tokyu Hands. Bought quite a bit at these stores. I noticed there was also restaurants between the hotel and train station. Just a warning the streets can be crowded at times and with all of the lights it can look like Las Vegas but everyone is pretty cordial towards each other.Checking out: Checking out was not problem. It was great that we could check into the second room after checking out of the first room. We did not have to wait until 3:00, the staff was very accommodating. The negative was the check out time was at 11:00 am, so the next day we had to check out at 11:00 even though our flight was not until 10:00 pm. The hotel let us store our luggage as we did some last minute touring. But since we did not have a room we did have to change clothes in the restroom.Airport Shuttle to Airport: We took the airport limousine bus to Haneda airport. Advice, please make reservations prior to leaving and you have to pay by cash. Unlike the other hotel where you could charge this to your room, we could not do this.Comments: Due to the size of the rooms, I don't think we would stay here again. Everything else was great, I really liked the convenience of having the mall next door. But the size of the room made it a negative.","Honolulu, Hawaii","gsuzuki</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",55,3.0

There were loads of things in the bathroom- toothbrushes, hairbrushesamd razors. There was plenty of shower gel and shampoo and conditioner. Breakfast was a mixture of Japanese and Western tastes so no problems and the chef came and talked to me about my gluten fre requirements which was very good. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the railway and underground stations and we used these to get around quite well but it is a challenge as English is not that widely spoken in Japan but everyone was so very helpful and friendly which was a great help.

But hey, never had I gotten a bigger blessing in disguise. We got 2 adjoining rooms in the panoramic 36th floor and everything looked new, clean, and even spacious for a typical Japanese hotel room. For starters, there were 3 pillows per bed which was quite unusual. Toilet and bath were expectedly compact but well compensated by the Toto washlet and the generous Shisheido amenities. An air streamer was provided to probably offset the numerous complaints about airconditioning. Right at the lobby was a 24 hour convenience store (Family Mart); you also need not leave the building to experience an aquarium, planetarium, an anime-inspired gallery, shopping (including a bookstore, a 100 yen store, a three coin store where everything is 324 yen), grocery, and restaurants. Within a short 5 minute walk is the Ikebukuro pedestrian shopping street and the namesake train station sandwiched by 2 large department stores.

I must admit breakfast is ordinary and the price to pay for such an ideally placed hotel are the throngs of tourists that crowd the lobby especially in the late afternoon you would think there is some celebrity coming over, not to mention the competition for elevator space.

My group was moved to another floor, but that floor smelled of smoke the next morning after our first night on the that new level. The non-smoking is not ""non-smoking.""

The room was quite small and especially the bathroom is very, very small, but, once again, we're in Japan…We experienced in the hotel a little earthquake (around 5.5* Richter) and all was ok. The buffet breakfast was decent, also the dinner. We could try the both Japanese and western menus. A very useful (and on time, all the time) shuttle bus (named ""Limousine Bus"") links this hotel with Narita airport. The hotel, being in an important traffic hub area, is full of tourists, but this is not an impediment, as we were in the city during all the day (as well in the evening). From Ikebukuro station (the world's second busiest underground/railway station – 2.71 million passengers per day), you are very close to the world first busiest underground/railway station – the famous Shinjuku (3.64 million people per day in 2007 – Guinness Book and there are around 200 exits). Very close is, also, the well-known Shibuya underground/railway station (3rd busiest in the world) and the amazing ""Shibuya crossing"", known as ""The scramble"", the world's busiest (once again) intersection! From Ikebukuro, you can reach very easy and fast every area in the metropolitan Tokyo, by train (really fast) or by underground. More, even Sunshine City Prince Hotel itself belongs on a huge mall, plenty of shops with reasonable prices, sometimes (all the prices in Japan are huge, at least for us!). You can reach the 60th floor (the 13th floor is missing), with a very nice elevator and you'll have an amazing 360* view of Tokyo area and even, if there is a clear atmosphere, you can see the Mount Fuji. All around Sunshine City Prince Hotel is a great commercial area, very, very animated. In this area (Ikebukuro station – Sunshine City Prince Hotel) is prohibited to smoke on the street and there is a kind of street rooms, without roof, with transparent walls, where the smokers have to enter in order to enjoy a cigarette.Finally, we really enjoyed this hotel and the surrounding area.","Bucharest, Romania","Madi_Paul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bucharest, Romania</strong>",16,4.0

Back then, everything here was new, modern and exciting. But visiting the area and this hotel in particular in 2015, nearly 40 years since its prime, it's clear that time has taken its toll. The hotel lobby and the hallways feel aged. No longer polished and kept up well. The hotel rooms feel similar to the very modest hotels in the US. For example, the bathroom appears as though it was last remodeled inexpensively about ten years ago. The carpet in the room is aged, starting to separate from the wall in a few spots. The walls have seen many visitors. I would think of this hotel as a convenient location to shower and sleep only. Don't expect much and you will be OK. One major irritation that I had was that all the room switches are connected to the central master switch by the exit door. Sure it's great for turning off all the lights when leaving the room but strangely this master switch also mandates the bright ceiling lights in the main sleeping area to turn on. So I cannot turn on just the small bedside lamp when this master switch is off. And no, I cannot turn on the bathroom light when this switch is off. If I wanted to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I would have to also turn on this master switch exposing everyone to the bright lights in the main area waking them up. Good location with a retro feel, like visiting a grandparent's old house in need of a major update. Many restaurants are near by and you can shower and sleep. Well, you can sleep only if you are staying solo or nobody else needs the bathroom light in the middle of the night. But the price wasn't horribly expensive by Tokyo standards.

The lobby of the hotel is merged with a huge mall that has everything from souvenir shops to tea stores to restaurants. There's even an aquarium. You might not even need to go out if you don't want to...or if you find yourself trapped inside because of a typhoon. The rooms are fairly small and kind of old-looking but clean. The price is great for what they offer and it includes breakfast (which is mostly Oriental-style but also has some fruit and cereal). The bathrooms are tiny, tidy cubicles and Japanese toilets are the most wonderful inventions in the world (the ones where you sit, not squat, although the latter have their advantages). It might take a while to understand all the buttons but, once you do, you'll want to take one home with you. Above all, this hotel is just very convenient because everything is right there.

First time to japan thus it did surprise me that the bathroom is pretty much a larger in built version of a potable toilet (with a bath tub hand wash sink and everything !) Guess maybe is due to safety reasons with the large occurrence of earth quakes. Is a pretty touristy hotel with large (and I really mean large !) group of tourists coming in and out of the hotel.

On our arrival we have to lug our bags through one of the busiest part of Ikebukuro- Sunshine Dori, a mind-boggling 10-15 minutes of crowd dodging.

We stayed at 12xx so did not have much fantastic views of the nearby Ikebukuro and Shinjuku skyline.. In terms of amenities there are many dining and shopping options in that area including the Seibu, Parco and Tobu Department stores, on top of the many restaurants and fastfood outlets.

This is an another example of a bubble era hotel that really hasn’t seen any updates since it opened in the 90’s. The rooms were clean, but the furniture and walls, etc. were showing signs of age and looked original. Especially in the bathroom the plastics were discoloring and another example was the desk had the top veneer starting to delaminate from water damage. Sound insulation was good and actually had some good views from the room of the city. It looks like they are mostly marketing this place to Chinese budget tour groups due to the overall condition, which must be nicer than what they expect in China but for what you can find in Tokyo it’s on the rough side. For this part of Tokyo I was expecting better and it really needs a major remodel.One drawback to the hotels’ location is it’s a bit of a walk from the JR Station if you are lugging bags as you have to go through the busiest part of Ikebukuro- Sunshine Dori, and then through the bottom levels of Sunshine City to get to the hotel. It’s about 10-15 minutes of crowd dodging doing it the first time with luggage. Once there you do have tons of access for shopping and plenty of places to eat, but if you are planning to use this as a base for hopping around the city on the subway you might want to look closer to the station. It is in-between the Tokyo Metro Higashi-Ikebukuro station and the JR Ikebukuro station so it can give you some options to get around but it’s a walk to both. You can get to the Tokyo Metro through the 1st sub floor of Sunshine City (basically street level), its’ about 5-7 minutes through interconnecting walkways. Dining in the hotel I found the prices to be high, especially with all the options in the mall & just outside the hotel. The breakfast buffet was about 2200 yen per day if you didn’t get it in a package. I found several options for breakfast outside the hotel, in the mall there is a McDonalds and French bakery Maison Kayser that opens early, a higher end grocery store and a Tully’s Coffee in the mall, and just outside the south side by the expressway (door is by Maison Kayser) there is a Jonathan’s and a Caffe Veloce down the street toward the JR station, and a Seiyu (Wal-Mart) grocery store. You can see all of this on Google maps, it’s labeled.One thing to watch for if you booked through Hotels or Expedia. This is the second time where I’ve booked a non-smoking room through them and had it confirmed, but when I arrived they said the room was smoking. The first time the hotel quickly switched it back to non-smoking, but this time the Prince wouldn’t do it and kept insisting I made a smoking room reservation. I’m not sure if it’s due to issues in the two systems talking together and not translating the non-smoking properly, or the hotel switching room types due to the price since they usually get a higher rate for the non-smoking rooms adn sell rooms at a doscount to Hotels/Expedia. And this place looked to have a lot more smoking rooms so I think I got switched due to room price.Overall if you can get it at a good price it’s OK if you just want a basic room that’s not fancy, but if it’s higher priced than The B or The Metropolitan look elsewhere.","Orange County, CA","MFRoadWarrior</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, CA</strong>",56,2.0

However, as I explored the city of Tokyo I realized that there are better hotels to choose from.Reasons why:* Some rooms are cramped. I felt there was not even adequate walking area in my room but some of my friends were checked in across the hallway and they had better rooms. Also my bathroom had a strong cigarette smell coming from the aircon which disappeared on Day 2 but was annoying.* Lobby is a disaster. Very shabby and concierge was not at desk at all times during my 3 day stay. It is filled with tourists in large groups checking in or out of the hotel, or with guests-in-residence who are down in the lobby to connect to wi-fi which is not available in rooms.* Location is okay but not exactly centrally located. It takes 10-15 mins to walk to the Ikebukura station via the shopping centre and not all of the walking distance is underground or covered. That can be a problem during rains/ snowfall.* The shopping centre has food court and a slew of restaurants but the nicer dining places in Tokyo for me were in and around Ginza / Shinjuku/ Roppongi.","Mumbai, India","1lifetotravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",87,2.0

The hotel is in Sunshine City, which is a huge shopping complex, so there is plenty to choose from to shop, eat and play (there's an aquarium, Namjatown - free admission for us with passports and room key, stage which we saw many boy/girl bands perform, etc). It's also connected to other malls (or so it seems), so you could just stay here if the weather was bad, etc. We had 3 adults and 2 small children, so we booked a triple occupancy room. Surprisingly, the room size was quite large (for Tokyo standards); probably what you would expect in a standard double sized suburban US hotel. The room had 2 double beds and a cot and there was still plenty of room for us. The bathroom is pint-sized...think of an airline bathroom x 2, if that, but functional. The sink was located outside the bathroom with a wall separating where the beds were, so that was nice (normally not my preference but with so many in one room, it was a plus). We booked a non-smoking room, and thankfully the room did not smell like smoke. The room seems like it was last renovated 20+ yrs ago...very tired, as many other reviewers have noted. The carpet was stained but the bathroom was clean. The beds...oy, the beds! They were hard, thin and I think I ended up bruising my right hip (I'm a side sleeper) after 3 nights on the mattress springs. The walls are thin too. With 2 young kids, we had to sleep early. The first 2 nights, it seemed like the guys next door were having a pretty great party as we could hear them cheering and shouting pretty late into the night (or so it seemed). There is no AC in December, so the first night was unbearably hot! Day temps running in the low 50's in the beginning of December. Turns out that the ""fan"" control in the room is for the heat only, during the winter, so either double-check with the front desk about temperature control or just leave it off. But it was annoying since there's no way to crack the windows so there was no air flow throughout the night. They actually give you an actually key for your room with the room number printed on it. As a former hospitality worker in the US, I was pretty horrified by this, but just be careful not to lose your key! I guess it's not much of an issue in Japan. We took the subway to the hotel, and it's not the easiest to find at first but once you know what andmarks to look for, it's fine. Walk towards the Toyota Amlux building if you are headed from the Ikeubukuro subway station since it is attached (see pic). Be mindful that Japanese maps often do not have North at the top of the map...it's quite disorienting, so you have to get your bearings based on landmarks. It's probably a good 15 min walk from the subway station, especially with luggage. You can also ask for the Tokyo Hands building in Ikeubukuro since the entrance to Sunshine City is right next door. It's much closer to the Higashi-Ikebukuro subway station (5 min walk) but it's on a different line and best to probably find the station from the hotel so you know how to get back. There is wired internet access available for free in the room. The hotel's website states it has free wi-fi in the lobby but I had problems accessing it and gave up. There is a FamilyMart in the lobby (ie: 7 Eleven), and it's a really great convenience. Try to find the Maison Kaiser (french bakery) in Sunshine City...it is amazing. The croissants, apple tarts, etc are delicious. I have to say that the Japanese sure do know how to make French pastries. I definitely had my fill while in Japan...and then some! Definitely also try to get lunch in the basement of the Seibu department store (where the Ikebukuro sugway station is located) or any of Tokyo's department stores. There's no tables to sit at but you can find chairs. The ""food hall"" is amazing, there's so much to choose from. Bottom line...would I stay here again? Due to location, yes (it's really all the hotel has going for it). But otherwise, no.",,FoodieNYer,17,3.0

Anyone in dire need to drive in Tokyo would appreciate it ;))That aside, the hotel reception area is unusually packed with airport-sized trolleys at first sight.

Especially with my limousine booking back to the airport. They put me on a high floor and its only a while later that I realised vibrations are most intense during an earthquake when you are at the top most of a building.Furnishings are simple and there are only tea cups, in which making a piping hot cup of Milo is not possible. WC is wonderful with bidet attached plus a warm seat included.Overall, this hotel is excellent if your expectations are not too high.

Generally, staff were friendly and helpful. There were a few fluent English speaking staff at the front desk. We had a room for 3 adults on the 29th Floor. There were two single beds (large) and one rollaway. Room size was big enough to accommodate all of us. It would be good if the hotel could change the curtain in the room - looked worn out!! Bathroom ceiling was low though for those who are tall. Don't expect to have normal size bath tub here - it's small. Only green tea is given in the room. No coffee provided. There was free wifi at the lobby area and limited to 30 mins per use but hotel staff were able to increase usage time when we approached them. There are a few paid computer kiosks at the lobby - 100Yen for 10 minutes. Airport limousine bus stops right in front of the hotel, so is pick up. You can book and buy your limousine ticket at the hotel. There is a Family Mart near the hotel lobby and a supermarket (Seiyu) at the South Entrance of Sunshine City. Burger King, McDonalds and other eateries can be found at Sunshine City.. It took us about 10-15 minutes to walk to/from Ikebukuro Station. Lots of things to see along the way. The station itself is huge with many exits and there are departmental stores and shops linked to this station. So for those getting down at Ikebukuro Station, make sure you know which exit to take.I will hesitate to stay here again for my next visit.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","desertrose28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",9,4.0

The only setback is tt the windows r sealed & the air can get staled coz the airflow is a little weak. Fyi, this was in Dec(winter time).

The shoppin' centre offers a wide variety of interests like shoes, clothin', cafes, rests, souvenirs, bookstore & so forth. On the other end of the shoppin' centre is an office bldg. 3rdly: Out fm the bldg, across the road, there're lots of eateries & shoppin' centres. Quite a number of gd ramen & bento rests tt open till late. 4thly: the main station - Ikebukero is located here. It's basically a straight walk once u cross the road fm the shoppin' bldg into Ikebukero. I wus estimate a leisure 12-15 mins walk. This stretch of road is jam packed durin' peak hrs right up till abt 9pm!. Fm Ikebukero station, u can move on to other places of interests like Disneyland & Shinjuku. Needless to say, the shoppin' centre abv the station is awesome!. Lots of gd buys fm the basement where the pastries, cakes & so forth r sellin' like hot cakes to both the locals & foreigners(read as tourists) alike!.Almost every nite, it's packed!. Lastly, u can catch the bus fm the hotel entrance to the a/port!. What u nid to do is to book in advance @ the main counter upon check in.So, I wud say, this hotel has abt everythin'.

The included breakfast buffet had a very large selection of Japanese and western food.The hotel is a pleasant 10-15 minute walk from Ikebukuro train station, and is also connected by underground walkway to the Higashi Ikebukuro subway station. The hotel is also directly connected to the Sunshine City complex; you have access to tons of dining, shopping and entertainment options without ever stepping into the open air.

Bedding - Panorama floors has new bedding from Simmons and it is comfortable.

Within the complex is the giant Sunshine City Mall with even more shops, eateries, and amusements. I agree with others that the hotel is showing its age a bit, but it was still clean and great especially for the location and price.
