Right next to Kapiolani Park and a block from Waikiki Beach (Queen's Surf side) . The units are individually owned, so decor, amenities and prices vary widely. If you choose carefully, you'll get good value. They have a small lobby and a small pool. If you're banking on spending a lot of time using a pool during your stay, choose another place.

The condo was so-so. It met our criteria for clean, cheap, and safe. The hotel itself was surprisingly nice. There was an entrance lanai where you could comfortably sit and watch the passing parade. The folks at the front desk were unfailingly cordial and helpful. The internet was surprisingly robust. We've stayed many places that advertise free internet but provide sketchy service. The connection at the Waikiki Grand was excellent. The location was ideal -- about half a block to the beach. On the 10th floor was a lovely terrace open to all of the hotel guests. It offered a great view of the ocean, beach, and verdant Kapiolani Park. The view of Diamond Head in the evening was very pretty. You could even look down into the Honolulu Zoo next door and see the elephants if you knew where to look. There were two elevators and one or the other frequently was out of commission. The hotel was quiet. If I had it to do over again, I might have rented one of the condos owned by the hotel itself. There was a Teddy's Bigger Burger restaurant off the hotel lobby. The food was good but the service wasn't consistent.","Spokane, Washington","circa2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spokane, Washington</strong>",26,4.0

It had incredible views of Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach, and the zoo. The views were better than I imagined. I figured we would only have a partial ocean view. I was surprised.

All toiletries and clean towels were supplied as well as beach towels on request. Plenty of toilet paper was provided and more was available if needed. Room cleaning/ servicing was done every 3 days, but I was told fresh towels were available on request. The double (queen size?) bed was large and comfortable, without any sagging and the sheets were changed when the room was serviced. My room had a full kitchen with cooking utensils, a large fridge, cook top, microwave oven, filter coffee maker and dishes/ cutlery. There was also a huge, curved screen HD television and two set top boxes with cable TV. The room was very effectively cooled with an air conditioner and there was also a ceiling fan over the bed. Some of the leaves in the vertical drapes were missing, but I located a stack of spares in the wardrobe, which I promptly deployed into service! The Castle staff were friendly and helpful. Honolulu Zoo is across Kapahulu Avenue. The walled section of Waikiki Beach, which would be great for parents with young kids, is a short walk from the property, as is Queens Beach.I can recommend this hotel, but please note that I was in a room managed by Castle Resorts and Hotels.

When I arrived at the hotel on the day of check in they advised I could not check in early as they didn’t know what/if any rooms were available.On check in I was charged an extra $125USD for cleaning and the resort fee. I had heard it was common to charge a resort fee in Hawaii however this place is not a resort at all.The hotel room was sufficient. It had a cute view and lots of tacky fake plants. It took me about 10 minutes to work out how to work the shower so instructions would have been nice. To work the shower you had to run the bath then pull the spout down.The resort fee apparently covers things like beach towels from reception. I borrowed s beach towel and it was the crunchiest most offensively patterned towel that looks like it came from a lost property box. I felt like I needed things to touch it.The ‘resort’ has a pool - to access you had to walk through a carpark and burger joint and the three broken deck chairs were filthy.My room had a ‘kitchenette’ but no corkscrew. I visited reception and they said they only had one corkscrew for the entire resort so I had to bring it straight back. I was also told if I was expecting a corkscrew I should have stayed at the Hilton which is twice as expensive. I understand you get what you pay for however I did not think opening a bottle of wine would be such a drama.The hotels saving grace is its location. It’s at the more chilled edge of Waikiki and it has a cool gay bar downstairs. Based on this I would recommend paying the small difference in price and staying next door at the Queen Kapiolani Resort which looked a lot nicer.,"Sydney, Australia","A5562YNmatthewb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",32,2.0

Being across from the zoo provides several benefits; the area is quiet, the view is great (if you’re on that side) and there was always parking in the zoo parking lot at $1.00 an hour 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, which is a huge bonus in Waikiki where parking is so hard to find and expensive.There is also a large lobby with seating and a concierge to help you find activities around the island, and restaurants if you don’t want to eat at Teddy’s Burgers on the first floor or Hulas Bar on the second floor. On the tenth floor there is a nice sun deck with tables and chairs looking out over the zoo, park and beach with a great view of Diamond head and there was a small pool that we did not use with chairs to lounge in an soak up some sun.Room 618 is high enough to be away from the noise of the street and the music from Hulas. The room was clean, we didn’t see any bugs and it is equipped with a min-fridge, a microwave, coffee pot and a hot plate with all the necessary plates, glasses, cutlery and pots and pans to cook or reheat meals if you so desired; but we never did. There are two double beds with sheets and pillowcases that were clean and sparkling white but with no spread or cover on the beds, just the sheets and a blanket. How hard is it to put a spread on the bed, even just a white sheet with a bed runner? There is a small flat screen TV and the air conditioner worked very well, too well almost with lots of accompanying noise. However, this room is tired, with mildew and flaking paint in the bathroom and the clothing storage was a rusting cheap wire rack, which however had plenty of hangers. There is a large closet in the “kitchen” area but it was locked, I assume with owner belongings in it. The bathroom has another cheap rusting rack, with clean white towels on it. The walls around the bathtub are decaying, and the paint is cracked on the ceiling, although there is instant plentiful hot water. There is no lanai (balcony) but the windows open (no screens) and the view is of the hotel next door with its rooftop pool, and between high rises, you can see a bit of the mountains in the distance.I think this hotel is in a great location but whoever owns room 618 needs to gut and remodel it; because it could be a really nice comfortable little studio with a little work. All of the staff members I talked to were very nice, friendly and helpful. I would stay here again but not in this room; but I would request an upper level room with a lanai facing the zoo, or a room on the sundeck level.","San Jose, California","Divermaiden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",9,3.0

It cooker hob,it did have a portable inductor cooking plate which if it was just one person cooking for then it would be fine plus there was no extractor fan so when using it I was bothered that the heat from the pan would set the fire alarms off which was above the kitchenette work surface.I can honestly say I was rather peed off even though the room was a really nice room and clean and did have the balcony it was not what we had booked..When I went down to reception and spoke to the person he was very nice he did say he would speak to the manager too see if we can be moved tomorrow and they stated that bookings.com had not told them of our requirements, which I would imagine that would have had the same booking confirmation we had had and requirements. We said we would take that up with booking and made sure that we were only getting charged for the room we had actually stayed in not the one which we had actually meant to have stayed in.We decided that after seeing some of the rooms on passing them that were open and looking at the reviews we would stick with the room we had as it was ok.

I reservation is needed, upon arrival we were told we had no parking space as it had to be reserved and we would have to parking on the paid car park until they could allocate us a space, it’s cost us 24 dollars to park the car over the road from the hotel for 24 hrs as there was no where else to park and we had to keep driving round the car park for about 30 minutes waiting for a space to become free.. if you stay here ensure you email hotel to ensure you have parking on their carpark as it will be expensive. We then had to pay 130 dollars parking for the time we were there which we were aware off. I was also surprised that we paided a 130 dollars cleaning fee when booking and. It once during our stay did we get clean towels, which normally in other places I had stayed if the my don’t have a cleaning service they usually come in every 4 to 5 days to offer you clean towels... there was a laundry there to do any washing we needed to, but seen as though you have to pay a cleaning fee I would expect to at least not to have to wash the hotel towels and that they would change them for you. Thankfully we had own own towels too.Hotel staff are really nice and friendly and try to help where ever they can, the hotel is in a good location to the beach and shops and restaurants too, although it’s wasn’t the best it’s was it was ok and we had a good time in Waikiki it didn’t spoil our holiday.

Good size room, well modernized, with a kitchen and very comfortable bed. We had a room on the 6th floor facing the zoo and Diamond Head. The balcony was great to emjoy breakfast watching the ocean.There is a bar/nightclub on the second floor, so I would insist on the higher floors to minimize the noise potential. It was not an issue for us. I would also insist for a room facing the zoo for a very nice view and sunrise. You would never tell that you are in Waikiki with all its high rises and hoopla.The front desk staff was extremely nice and helpful, explaining everything regarding the hotel. Unless you reserve one of the parking spots, you have to park across the street at the 24 hour parking at the zoo. It was $1 an hour, and you have to time your entry to avoid it being full, but it was not a problem. Plus you can renew the parking by text messaging, which is a nice feature.Finally of course, this is a great location, at most 2 minute walk from the protected beach at the Kapahulu ""Wall"". And 1 minute from a starbucks for those who need their morning coffee.

The hotel is at the quieter end of Waikiki, across from the Honolulu Zoo, & there is a big Safeway store about a mile down Kapahulu Avenue. The units that are in the hotel pool are individually owned, so the style & décor vary from unit to unit. In this visit I was in Room 501, with a city view. The room has a fridge, 2 burner cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, toaster oven, with very basic kitchen implements. The room was clean, with fresh towels & sheets every 3 days. However, the room itself is looking a little shabby, so the owner of this particular unit needs to spend a bit of money to look after their investment. The unit really needs a fresh coat of paint. There are is also a hall runner, & rug in the unit which are worn & dirty. They should either be replaced or removed all together. These are just cosmetic improvements which would make a world of difference! There are other units in this building, which are not part of the hotel pool & the Castle Waikiki Grand is not responsible for their cleaning & upkeep. The city view rooms are in the back of the building, & can be noisy. I live in an urban environment, so the noise did not bother mer.

We had a fantastic time on the island however, there were a few things about the place that I’m not raving about. Our flight arrived in Honolulu early morning and check-in doesn’t start until 3pm (not an issue). They allowed us to store our bags for the day but when we arrived at 3 to check-in, they told us that our room had damage and we should come back an hour later. We came back on time to find the repair man watching basketball on TV in our room rather than doing his job. We were then told that the room needed maintainence and we were shifted to a new room (which was nicer and packed with a equipment and a lanai). I also had to pay USD $136 for apparently two cleaning fees but the first only involved a changing on bath towels so $68 for bath towels didn’t sit well for me. The hotel is not all bad though. The staff at the front desk were respectful and polite and the location is fantastic. For the price I paid per night, the faults aren’t that big a deal. Our flight home was cancelled resulting in us staying another night in Honolulu and when I explained our issue the staff were wonderful and gave us a discount rate for the night with no extra charges. Every hotel has faults and some are greater than others, but in the grand scheme of things our trip was fantastic and our room served its purpose.

It was more like a condiminium than a hotel, which was fine just not what I was expecting. When I asked for a wash cloth they asked how many I had. When I told them none, the front desk assistant turned to the person behind her and said very strictly, ""Give her ONLY 2."" We had a broom no dust pan so cleaning was difficult. We were promised to be delivered soap to wash our dishes when house keeping came around, but house keeping only comes around once a week so we had to wait a week to get soap to wash our dishes. In the closet there was a pot of dirt that clearly used to be a plant but was just stuffed into the closet. The sun deck they advertise is actually apart of someone elses deck so they close it down to the public. You have to go through a restaurant to get to the pool. They had given me the wrong code to the pool and then mocked me for not remembered the correct code when I asked what it was. They were extremely rude with every question i had for them and extremely not accomadating.

I booked the room through an Expedia package deal, so I was assigned the room number/airbnb when I arrived at the hotel- I would suggest looking at individual rooms and requesting a specific one if possible.

The site I booked through said it included weekly cleaning. They knocked it down to $109 but had I known this I would have chosen a different place because there were nicer places available for less. The only other complaint I have was about the hot water in the shower. Didn't matter the time of day I showered there would be occasional bursts of scalding hot water. I think it happened whenever someone flushed a toilet somewhere. I would have to jump out of the water stream to avoid it. The Good: Other than the cleaning fee and the hot water issue my stay was fine. The room is small and the decor is dated but everything was in good condition and clean. The staff were very nice, especially Roxy..who was very friendly and good about making me feel very welcome. Its located very close to the beach.

Our first day went smoothly, staff was nice, views of Diamondhead and right across from the Honolulu Zoo! However, when night came, everything changed.The shower was clogged. We called maintenance and they came to fix it same day. But, what they ended up doing was removing the entire cover to the bathtub overflow drain. The interior of the hotel wall was exposed and every time we showered, water would pour into it. We let the front desk know every day as we didn’t want future damage to happen to the unit that would be costly to repair.The A/C was leaking into a bucket that was placed outside on the balcony, but that didn't stop it from coming into our room! Half of our room was ‘off limits’ because the floor would be soaking wet from the a/c leakage. It was a basic standard room with a king bed…so not very big. Again, we told the front office every day but all they did was place towels over it. We asked to be moved to another room but were continually told nothing was available.The Friday before we left, we did our daily reminders (a/c leaking, bathtub overflow drain exposed) and had (what we thought) was the pleasure to speak to Roxy. She was nice and finally got us into a new room. She had told us that we needed to bring up these issue with Hotwire as we were very unhappy with our stay and wanted some compensation back for the 7 days we had to deal with a flooded room. She said that management would agree to whatever Hotwire requested. She lied! When speaking with Hotwire, they said they would have gladly refunded the money as long as the hotel agreed to it. When they spoke with Roxy, she said they wouldn’t refund anything! Not even partial! Hotwire couldn’t withhold the funds since they were already sent to the hotel.We basically paid over $700 to stay in a flooded room. I even have pictures and sent it to management and Hotwire!

This place has lots of character and charm, and is not your typical hotel. It's not a massive, impersonal tower, but rather a throw-back to a different era with inviting open spaces, from the lobby with the nightly piano player, to the roof deck with probably the best views in Honolulu. Every single staff person I interacted with was super kind and helpful. My unit (#515) was perfect, with a comfortable bed, a huge TV, nicely decorated, super fast internet, and a kitchenette with a large fridge which allowed me to eat in whenever I wanted. The best part was the lanai with spectacular views of Diamond Head, Honolulu Zoo, Kapiolani Park, and the postcard perfect beach (half a block away). You can see the flamingos and hear the monkeys from the zoo in the mornings if you're sitting in the lanai. On Sunday, there were Hawaiian families having picnics in Kapiolani Park with impromptu hula dancing (and I didn't see any tourists). This place is all about location. You're at the edge of urban Waikiki / Honolulu behind you (with tons of great restaurants, hotels with shows, museums, theater, shops, etc..), but with unobstructed views of a tropical paradise in front of you. There is a newly installed bike share station a block away, which I used daily to ride around Diamond Head and along the beautiful coast. The neighborhood is super clean and safe, making long walks (even at night) very enjoyable. The weather during the first week of August was super comfortable with low humidity, constant trade winds, and best of all, zero mosquitoes.

Expedia Deceived from the start:[June 16, 2017EXPEDIA DECEIVES, MISLEADS -- NEVER PATRONIZE EXPEDIA AGAIN.I just returned from a week in Honolulu --  Flights,Transfers, & Hotel via Expedia [I cannot find a way to do Yelp nationally, so have to do it via a local office -- want the local folk to send it up to the real suits wherever Expedia does its business nationally]. The ""Hotel"" turned out to be a privately owned condo, in a place called the Castle Waikiki Grand Hotel.  A misnomer if there ever was one.  1. That was the first lie, deception by EXP.2. It was substandard, it did not provide what was described. [I will write a separate Review for the condo.] 3.EXP snuck it in with the real hotels on its webpages 4. Therefore, the price was not at a discount for a missing-service and missing-amenities package. So one pays full whack for what can be described as a hostel, not a hotel.  I have cancer and congestive heart failure, am a disabled veteran as well... I expected at least to have purchased a hotel room and its expected ambience.  I got an uncomfortable, depressing, grimmy miniscule room.  I think folk who have been cheated and lied to by  EXP should enact a class action law suit.  I would join. ]The Receptionists could be friendly, but they let inquirers, Guests or not, cut in line. You could be politely standing awaiting your turn and they would deal with someone who came after you. You do not want to appear rude, so you let it slide. Not very good customer service to the polite person. It turned out Studios in this “Grand” “hotel” are privately owned [SURPRISE!] so if the owner allows fabric and furnishings to go Derelict, you have no recourse. A proper hotel-ambience – which is what you paid for – was not there. Expedia is the one you have to ultimately complain to, and when you are on holiday, who wants to go that distance. These discrepancies and inadequacies, and the “management” : 1. the Shower lack of drainage left you standing in dirty water, despite calling it to their attention;2. they did not change the Sheets even the one day they said they would [I know my own stains, the ones I had to put up with the whole week];3. they did not Clean the room properly, as there was the same Screw on the floor after they declared a cleaning-day, and the floor constantly felt gritty though I never went in the sand – a $145 cleaning fee for this!;4. Air Conditioner worked, but it was less than two feet from your head… so the noise and the chill was like sleeping in a refrigerator;5. you looked out directly onto the next Building and the Parking Lot – what City Scene did you pay for! – it was a total lie, by Expedia;6. the Noise just 2 – 3 stories below, of delivery Trucks, their horns, their back-up alarms at 0330 was evident right next to your floor-to-ceiling jelousy windows, right next to your bed;7. the Curtains were of the variety that let in light 24/7 from 7 stories of neighboring buildings;8. the Hallway was being painted, [with a nice mural, yes] but only 1 day that week, so the splattered paper over the total hall floor would be there seemingly forever – a small point, but one which Expedia did not inform of – so your “hotel” was in a constant state of construction. Did Expedia give a discount, as a reputable seller would do?9. A sign: “Leave Kindle Here” – it was not there from the start, so would the poor Guest be blamed? 10. The Toilet seat was obviously in need of replacement, the door Chain Lock had been unslightly torn from the wall and left dangling, with holes in the frame … they left these to me, the paying Guest, to have to take up with the “management”. Thanks for a normal holiday, Expedia.This was a sloppy, bush-league operation from the start. To think, a supposedly reputable agency like Expedia would make someone pay for this “Grand” “hotel”. It is a shameful way for them to operate. If I did not have Cancer and Congestive Heart Failure, and Veterans Disability as well– which made me seek some nice peaceful holiday to begin with – I would want to take Expedia to small claims court.

The kids' was simpler with two full beds, a tv, AC, big windows that open, decent bathroom, fridge, microwave & coffee maker. They had their own sanctuary!! Good for us too!! Our room was perfect for our 12 day stay. King size bed, futon couch, tv, small table & chairs, little kitchenette with a full size fridge, microwave, small stove & coffee maker, oh and AC. Every morning we slid open the big windows & propped open the door- creating a wonderful tradewind cross breeze to relax in. There was enough room for the kids to be there when they wanted.Location? Maybe a half block from Queens Beach...maybe. 5 minutes and you're sitting in the sun or swimming. Zoo is right across the street which the kids enjoyed. Want to take a drive? Being on the outskirts of Waikiki, you can easily get in & out on Kapahulu. Easy walking distance to stores & restaurants. Oh have to make sure I mention the 10th floor! You can sit up there and enjoy an amazing view! Pictures below...I would stay here again hands down! If you are very picky & expect hoity toity then this is not the place for you.

Don't be fooled - this doesn't mean that your room will be cleaned or serviced; you are essentially paying so that the room will be re-set at the end of your stay ready for the next guest.I stayed for a full two weeks so I found it inconvenient that linen changes were not available. When I inquired about the possibility of fresh sheets I was met with some resistance at the reception counter, because they were reluctant to assist me. It ended up being easier to use the laundry room and wash the bed linen and towels myself using coin operated washers and dryers - clearly this is below the standard expected of a 'hotel', or even Airbnb homes. I was quite surprised considering the price, which was not cheap.However, if you agree to this in advance and you're willing to fend for yourself a bit, the room itself was comfortable, the air conditioning and tv worked well, and the kitchenette with full size refrigerator means you can prepare my own meals rather than eating out all the time.The gay club on level 2 is welcoming and has a great lunch menu every afternoon.Avoid the burger place on the ground floor - rude service and questionable hygiene.","Adelaide, Australia","BonoAussie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",46,4.0

We may be a bit biased because we selected the hotel based on the fact that there is a gay bar on the second floor of the complex. (I actually found the hotel when searching for bars.) Our room was on 3rd floor, so we were steps away from nightlife whenever we wanted.The staff is wonderful - especially Roxy at the front desk. She's so helpful - can answer any question about her town - and, she's a sweetheart. Location is amazing - on the edge of Waikiki, so there aren't the hordes of shoppers clogging the sidewalks. The beach is right there. The zoo is across the street, so you're not surrounded by buildings - and the views from the 10th floor deck (ocean and Diamond Head) are amazing. There is a great burger place (Teddy's Bigger Burger) on the first floor that also serves huge breakfasts. I didn't read any reviews before visiting, but read many during some down time while visiting. I don't understand the ones who complained. I mean - one person complained about animal noises coming from the zoo. Well - there is something called Google Maps - and it clearly shows the zoo across the street. Why complain about some exotic bird songs. It's like buying a home near an airport and complaining about jet noise. Another complained about power use being regulated. That is preposterous. That person probably ran the microwave and hairdryer at the same time and tripped a circuit breaker.It is the best value in Waikiki and I highly recommend it.

The carpet was threadbare, heavily stained and dirty. The mattress on the bed was old and sagged, the bed itself swayed disconcertingly whenever we got in or out. There was dirt built up along the floor and walls in the entrance. The deadbolt on the door did not work. The bathroom was not big enough to have a proper door but had a sliding door that only closed a third of the way. The bathroom walls had splatter around the toilet and the floor tiles were poorly laid with dirt filled gaps at the walls and by the bath. The shower/bath grout was stained, possibly mildew. There was not any soap, only one bath towel (for two guests) and the room was only ""cleaned"" every third day (i.e. the day we left). We had to,pay the full amount on check-in, presumably to stop guests from leaving early to find decent accommodation, which we would have done if we'd been able to. Yes, the Grand has a great location across from the beach and zoo, and yes it is a budget hotel BUT there are minimum acceptable standards that this hotel fails on multiple counts. We have stayed in challenging accommodation in Africa, South America, the Philippines and Eastern Europe but this hotel ranks as one of the worst.

Our room was excellent, despite it being one of the economy rooms. It included a full size fridge, microwave, etc. It was clean and while the décor was a little kitschy, it had lots of space. There were laundry facilities in the building. There was very reasonably priced parking. There is an incredibly fun gay bar on the second floor of the building with daily drink specials.

Our stay was two weeks long and we enjoyed every minuet of it!The condo itself is well appointed providing absolutely everything you could need and more.It's new and therefore pristinely clean and all the renovation work is top notch. Well located, just a minuet or two from the beach, it has great access to all that is Waikiki but also you are at the far end of the strip and facing the Zoo and Queen Kapiolani Park so you are out of the crazy that can also be Waikiki. We travel the world and also come back to Hawaii, where my husband and I met, very frequently. We have often rented apartments, houses and condos where ever we travel and always on Oahu. I can safely say that this property is as advertised and more. The owner is easy to deal with and helpful and the value is above average. Best suited to two adults or two adults and one child. Perfectly clean and absolutely pest free! The kitchen is quite "" cook-unable"" and the bathroom and shower are new and large enough to be quite comfortable. Brenda says new curtains are on order and with fairly good air-con, the place is complete and almost Lux compared to what is available in Waikiki and especially in the rest of this building/hotel for the most part. The hotel in which the condo is available is part hotel, part residential and part vacation rental. It is clean, in good repair, and safe. Parking is available from the front desk at a fee per day.

We were then told that the bed bugs were most likely coming from another room & stated that they had issues on that floor with people not cleaning their apts. We were never offered a new room, we should have never had to stay in a room that needed to be exterminated more than twice & risked getting bed bugs in our luggage, etc. It is digusting.

My Fiance and I cut our 7 day stay here short after 2 nights because of the large cockroach that was sleeping in our bed and the poor service that we received when we alerted the hotel staff. I'm talking about the rather rotund guy working the front desk. Not only did they handle the cockroach situation abysmally, ""What do you expect lady, it's a tropical island? That's why we're also fumigating the rooms."", that's right, while we were staying there, they put up notices on all the rooms letting the guests know that they would be going in and fumigating; but the management also failed to contact us to apologize or speak with us about the large cockroach. The fact that management wasn't at all concerned about guests leaving because of roaches, should be a telling sign at the frequency with which this must happen. I waited to write this scathing review to see if maybe someone would contact me but no one obviously cares. I'd like to add that the guy working the front desk made the situation much worse. First he chastised us for not reporting the roach right away; we found the roach at 11pm and were exhausted and the next morning we had a tour planned super early, so we didn't report it until 3:30pm or so the following day. Then the front desk guy exasperatedly told us that it was a tropical island and we should expect to see bugs. All in all he was upset with us for even bringing it up. To make matters even worse, the first night we had also found a beetle in our sink, this didn't really bother us since it was a beetle and it was in the sink. And the air conditioner was 2 feet from our heads, so it was either freezing cold and right in our faces or extremely humid and stifling. We got no rest the first night, before the cockroach was even involved. This is supposed to be a vacation, don't spoil it by staying at this horrible place. Soo much money is spent on the flight and the hotel and the activities, why ruin it all?TL;DR: Large cockroach under the covers, fumigating the rooms, beetle in the sink, air conditioner pointed at our heads rendering it impossible to sleep, horrible service.","San Diego, California","sunshine619</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",17,1.0

The sink was not in the bathroom but in the middle of the room that they consider a ""kitchen"" but it's so far from a kitchen. It appears they extended the room by possibly enclosing around what was previously a patio, so you could see on the ceiling and wall where the extension was made. Not a big deal, but the curtains did not fully cover the windows so that was inconvenient in the morning.

I booked a room at the Waikiki Grand on June 5th, and I was surprised after I received the confirmation that a ""Cleaning Fee of $170.94 per stay"" is not included in the fee.I have booked a room for 3 nights from June 11-14 and the rate displayed $267.I read the conditions before booking and I do not recall reading anything regarding ""Cleaning Fee of $170.94 per stay."" The only excluded charge that I recall reading was the 13.96% tax.I tried to call the hotel directly to inquire and clarify the said fee but unfortunately, nobody was available to take my call, and their voicemail box was full and cannot receive anymore messages.I just sent them an email that evening and I was hoping to hear from them the next day. I think I've been duped when I was booking my hotel room at Waikiki Grand. I have used online booking services for my lodging previously, but this is the first time I've been given inadequate information before completing my booking.In addition, the condition regarding cancellation is not quite fair. It states, “Please note, if canceled, modified, or in-case of no-show, the total price of the reservation will be charged.”The next morning, I received a reply from the online booking service, and at first the managing director found the “Cleaning Fee” strange. After another exchange of email, I was informed that there are two properties at Waikiki Grand. One property is the hotel and the other is the condotel, and I have booked mine at their condotel/vacation rental.I also called Waikiki Grand based on the phone number posted online, but the person I spoke with did not have any information for me. She suggested I call the owner directly, but she doesn’t have the phone number. I also received an email from Waikiki Grand and was informed that they do not have any reservation under my name. I realized that there are different companies/owners running Waikiki Grand.I also emailed the other contact person for Vacation Rental at Waikiki Grand and she replied immediately, and even called me. Unfortunately, she cannot answer my question either. She is only in charge of checking in guests.When I arrived at Waikiki Grand on June 11th, I asked the receptionist regarding access to the condotel. I asked for the key and she simply said, “I don’t have the key. Just go there and put in the code.”I did not realize that the access code emailed to me was the code I need to punch in the electronic keypad to access room. I was not informed that there is no key required.When I got to the condo, I was disappointed because of the following:1. The door knob needs to be fixed. (This was fixed the next day). The rep claims that she had already called a week ago to have it fixed.2. The shelf is positioned infront of the air-conditioning.3. The curtain did not completely cover the window.4. There were two lights missing out of three in the headboard in the bedroom.5. There were two beds in the bedroom, upper and lower. I hit my head when I stood in the lower part (No, I did not stand on the bed). 6. The bedroom has a sliding door, which prevents the cool air from the a/c to get in. So I slept in the sofa bed in the living area. I did not use the bedroom at all.7. There were frozen food and ice cream left in the freezer, which were removed later in the afternoon after I reported it.8. I found a lighter in the couch.9. The couch appears to have seen better days.10. The shower curtain appears to have seen witnessed too many bodies. This needs a new one.11. This unit appears to be going through renovation. The drywall and the sliding doors haven’t been completely installed. 12. I can still see the painter’s tape in the divider.13. The water kept on dripping in the shower/tub, but the maintenance guy said, “It’s major work. Need to turn off the water in the building.” So I just did my best to turn it off after using, so as not to waste water.On the positive side:1. Great location!2. Bus stop is just a few steps away.3. The unit is on the quiet side.4. The internet is reliable and fast.5. Cable TV and Netflix are available.6. There are two refrigerators, which are both in good working conditions.7. The rep. (Shay Bowie) was polite and did her best to help. When I told her about the issues of the unit, she offered another unit where I can transfer, but I would have to pay again and not get a refund from this unit. When I brought up the cleaning fee, she justified that the dry cleaning of the comforter is already $50! But I am not interested in knowing the cost of the dry cleaning.Therefore, I do not recommend this hotel or vacation rental at all specifically unit 318… Had I known and read about the “Cleaning Fee” and the other maintenance issues, I would have booked a room at a different place.","South San Francisco, California","Darna-Jedi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South San Francisco, California</strong>",21,2.0

I would agree with the reviews below about the staff...they treated us as if we were not exsistant once they found out we ""rented privately""...even general questions seemed to put them out (very rude!).

It's location is excellent, and all the advertising copy is impeccable. We arrived late (11 pm) after a long international flight, and there was a security guard attending the desk (actually, he wasn't attending the desk, and we had to wait a good 5-7 minutes for him to come back to the desk). We got our room code and arrived in a room that was not what we had booked (we'd book 'ocean view'; our room definitely was not), and was certainly disappointing. There was a very large pole in the middle of the room (see photo), which was at best inconvenient. I'm sure the room was very stylish in the early 1960s. The bed was squishy-soft (we both ended up with painful backs). The noise from the window air conditioners in nearby rooms was quite deafening. On reading the introductory material we received we discovered that the room would only be serviced every three days. We were there four, and never saw any kind of service, even to empty the rubbish bin (yes, just one). There was a TV (which remote did not function) and a refrigerator in the room. Bathroom was small but functional, as long as the shower drain was correctly aligned- otherwise the water accumulated and did not drain. And there were roaches, both small and large. We spoke with a manager about the roaches; he told us that the exterminator came monthly and was due in the next day or so. This is obviously not good enough. (Even in some remote Pacific island hotels I've stayed in at least they give you your own can of spray!) This hotel is well-situated a few metres from the beach, so it had the effect of making us go out and see the area. I also saw guests with animals, which was fine- I guess this is one of the places in Waikiki where you can stay with pets.The Waikiki Grand was undergoing renovations during our stay, and I can only hope that they lift their game soon. The website, advertising and literature about the hotel are excellent and very deceptive.

I bid on Priceline and was impressed with the price I got for a room in Waikiki and didn't even think to review this place, but something nagged at me to take a look. I looked at every way possible to get out of my reservation after reading the mostly negative reviews, but unfortunately I was locked in. My fiancee tried to reassure me that maybe we would get one of the rooms that were positive.

The room appeared to be clean. Cons: The check-in was pleasant enough except when I asked about the $17/day parking fee and was told that ""the parking garage is pretty slammed full tonight, but I can reserve something for you tomorrow... Oh wait your leaving tomorrow."" It seemed she expected me to just initial off on it and she never suggested where I should park for the night. We went up to the room (515) and the first thing we noticed was a putrid smell in the room. My fiancee thought it was the toilet backed up or something, but I have experience in this odor as a rat died in a crawl space at work and we had to live with this same smell for a week. Since it was late and we were leaving early in the morning (we live on a neighbor island and were there only for a concert) we decided to just go with it since there was no night manager available. We were located above the hotel bar and needless to say we didn't get much sleep! The shower was clean enough, however by the time I was finished with my shower there was 6 inches of water in the tub. As I was checking out I informed the guy at the front desk about the smell along with the many burned out light bulbs and he seemed to get defensive at first, probably thought I was trying to get discount or money back, but when he saw that I wasn't he then pretty much blew me off.Unfortunately I would not recommend this to anyone, nor will I be staying here when I next visit Oahu unless Castle requires the individual owners to invest some money in fixing up the units and establish some type of uniform standard.

Castle Waikiki Grand Hotel response was pretty much - they tried to help us but nothing was good enough. I previously responded but my response was not posted. In simple words, no one helped us. There was no manager on duty for 3 or 4 days and no one contacted us. After almost 7 months we finally were able to get a refund from our travel agent. The responses they post to unhappy people are standard. I would also like to state for the record, I have Stage 4 cancer and have learned to take life in stride. I don't like to complain but find the positive from all bad. This hotel - there was no good! Please don't stay here. We did end up finding a place to stay and had a wonderful time. My husband felt we were there and didn't want our vacation ruined. No guarantee I'd ever be able to travel again. I had never been in Hawaii. I'm very surprised this hotel has not been condemned. Besides the people we dealt with at the hotel, the other businesses, the locals, and the scenery were extraordinary. I told my husband, if possible, I would love to return.

I will list the Pros first. Really close to Waikiki beach, Honolulu Zoo and the Park. There is a fastfood restaurent adjacent to the Hotel. The music from the Bar on 2nd floor was not an issue. Multiple eateries close by. There is free parking on Monsarrat Ave and free overnight parking (6pm-7am) on Kapahulu Ave. There is a paid parking lot across the hotel which is $1/hr. Now I will list the Cons and why we won't be booking Room 304 again. Each room is maintained differently. The one we stayed had a terrible view and just looked cheap and dirty. It was one of the cheapest rooms that we found near Waikiki beach and upon entering the room, we discovered why it was priced the way it did. Either way, we will not be booking this hotel or this room again.","New York City, New York","TripDoc82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",7,2.0

We booked this hotel online and it looked pretty good for the price and location. ...location is pretty good but that's it. We were assigned room 406, which is mentioned in other reviews. We were supposed to stay 6 nights but checked out and found another hotel after a day and a half. I am not a picky person but the room was disgusting! There was day light between the window and outside wall, duct tape on the air conditioner and around the floor in the bathroom and I killed 3 large bugs in the room in the short time we were there. EWWW! I tried to shower the first night but the drain didn't work so I was left standing in 12"" of sandy water. Also, we were supposed to have a queen bed but had a double and there is a large pillar in the center of the room right up next to the bed. The furnishings are odd and mismatched. We returned to our room after the first day to find it had not been touched. The bed wasn't made, there was sand on the floor and our dirty towels were still there. When I inquired at the ftont desk I was informed they only clean every 3 days! That is unacceptable!! I am paying for a service and at least expect clean towels. To add to all of that the room did not have a coffee maker, blow dryer or ironing board. A HORRIBLE place to stay! Do not be fooled by their website. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.

My sister and I had a reservation for two nights (2/7/13 to 2/9/13) and ended up leaving after the first night. The bed is not a queen, which is what was stated on our reservation, but a full. Upon seeing this, we thought we had the wrong room. Went down to the front desk and the gentleman working said we had a queen bed. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know what a queen bed is since I own one. The wireless internet signal did not exist, either. Four devices could not find it. Even searched for hidden signal. The worst part was the noise from the plexi-glass windows that were taped together to support the air conditioner. The cracking sounds made it incredibly hard to sleep. I am pretty sure this a/c and window setup is probably a hazard. Definitely not stable. As soon as morning came, we sought out different lodging, which was almost impossible to find since it was a Friday night in Waikiki. My sister and I packed up our stuff and checked out early. Front desk gentleman did waive the parking fee for us and did apologize for our inconvenience and early departure. Whoever owns this little room is a con artist and should be ashamed of themselves.

I have never written a review positive or negative but I am doing this to spare anyone else the horrible experience my husband and I had. We stayed at this hotel in room number 406 on Feb.6th, 2013 I walked in and was mortified that this was actually a room being charged over $150 a night. To begin: I pulled down the bed cover to find the top sheet stained with oil, or something and the pillow having long black hairs on it. I took the sheets down to the front office girl and showed her the stains and she brought up a new set, that we had to make up. The bed was a full size and when you sat on the bottom of the bed it felt like it was broken in the center. The mattress cover was inside out and very poorly fitted, way to big for the bed. In the middle of the room was this huge concrete structure that butted up to the bed. Horrible. If the bed was not bad enough the noise was ridiculous. There is small window air conditioner that is jerry rigged on the diagonal in the window with plexiglass ducked taped into the frame. It that worked but was so loud. Just below the very dirty large windows that would not open for fresh air were numerous pool/air conditioning units. They too ran all night long and were very noisy.The shower tub combination did not drain so my the time you finished showering you were standing in 18"" of water. The towels were clean but random colors and style. No hair dryer, drinking cup, even plastic. The t.v remote did not work but it did not matter because you had to put the t.v. so loud to hear over the drone of all the equipment that is was not worth it. I never slept one wink the entire night. My husband stuffed his ears with cotton and put the pillow over his head and got a small amount of sleep. The furniture is the cheapest most random combination of stuff. This is the epitome of what you would call a slum lord. My understanding is that the rooms are individually owed, like condos, and rented out. The hotel simple manages the rooms. The owner of this room owes us a refund and an apology. The $30 credit off the $175.00 bill was not the least bit adequate for the condition of this room. Deplorable. I took pictures or everything. I am not sure if I will contact the fire department or someone because I believe most of this room is not up to code and could actually be a death trap. I feel ripped of and bummed that having waited 30 years to get back to Hawaii my final night there was this memory. Please shut down this room and do not let anyone else have this terrible experience.One more thing....you get in and out of this room by pressing four numbers into a lock on the outside of the door. It did not feel secure or safe.","Carlsbad, California","colko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carlsbad, California</strong>",1,1.0

Arrived on Jan 17 and stayed till the beg of Feb. For us it is PRIORITY ONE - LANAI and functioning kitchen which is great to keep costs down and this had best of both. We arrived to a very clean updated unit. The photos that are on the site for both units owned by Alice (Sun-N-Snow vacationrentalretreats) are exactly what you get and see inside and out on the lanai.Located at the quieter end of Waikiki but the bus stops right outside at the corner and you are right next to the zoo which limits the traffic compared to right downtown. We specifically chose this side of the Grand because of the beach view and being next to the zoo. There was granite countertops, a apartment size stainless steel refrigerator(which is invaluable) updated cupboards, cutlery,dishware,several useful appliances including blender,coffee maker, rice cooker etc. many bowls, salad spinner, pots and pans, plastic wrap etc . the list goes on and on.  Have stayed in the Grand multiple times in multiple units and this was one of the nicest. Last year the unit we had stayed in on the seventh floor was old outdated and filled with roaches but this unit (yes it is small but you aren't there to stay in the room) was neat and didn't feel dated and only saw one roach the whole trip.  The murphy bed was comfortable and attention was made to detail when it came to matching towels which were plentiful and bedding which was new and the lanai had a decent set of outdoor furniture not cheap white plastic chairs.  Also, on the lanai in a large deckbox is everything you could want for a day at the beach including Tommy Bahama chairs which made us the envy of our friends that had to bring theirs from home. Boogie boards, snorket equipment etc.... And there is room darkening curtains.Only complaint is that the pocket door was indeed a problem which if you weren't travelling with someone you were comfortable enough to leave the door open with then you would have to fight with it to close and open, and the airconditioner is right at bed level and try as we might we couldn't get the wifi in the room to work, but at least it was a updated TV.  Nice that dishsoap was provided and spices galore in the cupboard and ice was ready when we arrived in a very clean refrigerator. Had to call owner once while there about telephone restrictions and she called me right back - at least you have an in-unit telephone to make any local and 1-800 calls which was really convenient and with a calling card you can call anywhere in the comfort of your room.We would stay here again in a minute, would prefer the owner's unit on the 9th floor only for a better beach view but it was a pleasure dealing with this owner from booking on and you are always worried about being scammed but this owner obviously doesn't operate on Hawaiian time because she is always prompt to sent info etc.",Vancouver Island B.C.,"Madzwolf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver Island B.C.</strong>",7,4.0

I got a large efficiency style room equipped with a full kitchen that was very large and very nicely appointed. It had everything I needed for a very comfortable stay. There were only 2 negatives: first, very old-style jalousie windows made for extremely noisey nights of never ending traffic sounds, service vehicles, motor bikes, and trash trucks all night long. You can't get any sleep without earplugs. So if you're looking for quiet and serenity, forget this place or anywhere near by. The AC helped drown out a little of the traffic noise but the jalousie windows are a total waste of energy since they don't seal shut anywhere. Second, the floor was FILTHY. Cleaning service is only once every 3 days, and they only do the minimal necessary. The bathroom was clean, but the rest of the place was questionable. Bring a full container of disenfectant wipes - you're gonna need them. Otherwise, the security on the property was excellent, with continual camera monitoring of all the floors and corridors. The laundry facility was also very good and convenient, and the front desk is happy to make change for the coin operated washers and the dryers. Neighborhood-wise, the location is ideal, with plenty of ABC stores just a few steps away, a Starbucks on the corner, plenty of restaurant choices, and the beach, zoo, aquarium, and Queen Kapiolani Park just a 5-10 minute walk away. It's a perfect location for those who want an ""urban"" beach experience, but who don't want to be right in the thick of downtown Waikiki.

I stayed three nights on the 9th floor in a basic room with outdated furniture, a bathroom that could be updated with new plumbing and carpeting that could use a good cleaning or be replaced. Nonetheless, I was not disappointed with my stay.The room had a comfortable bed, small refrigerator, a balcony, air conditioning and free wi-fi. Since this is basically a time share condo, I understand each room is different. During my stay the hotel was relatively quiet although there is a bar and nightclub on the second floor. There is also a popular burger restaurant on the lobby level.In reading previous reviews, mention was made of this being a popular gay/lesbian hangout. The only way I knew that maybe the case is due to a Rainbow Flag flying from the second floor which could just as easily have been there because Hawaii is often known as the “Rainbow State”. In my opinion any issue with it being a gay/lesbian hangout is a non issue and should not affect anyone's decision to stay here.The Waikiki Grand does not offer daily maid service but the front desk is more than accommodating for any special needs. Although if you ask for an ironing board you will just get that without the iron, so ask for the iron too. There is also laundry facilities available on the property.For about US$100 per night booked through Priceline, I thought I got a great deal and will definitely be staying at Waikiki Grand again and again.

In a scramble to find a new place to stay for the remainder of our vacation we checked with front reception to get a room with the hotel to ease the burden of lugging our luggage around.

We placed our own towels down to sit. The bathroom door was initially slid closed that I had to get help from the front desk to open it. The bathroom floor had hair and dirt that was in every corner. Expect no help from the front desk due to their disinterest in the unit. We paid for parking only to find frequently someone else parked in our spot. The pool is tiny and hidden between concrete buildings (ugly!). We left halfway through our stay as we couldn't stand it any longer.

Both the main desk guy and the young woman spend their time sitting, glued to a computer and only bother to look up when you ask them a direct question. So much for the Aloha hospitality! The room, while obviously renovated was disappointing - no balcony with windows that didn't open. They were so filthy you could barely make out Diamond Head or the beach views. The air-conditioning was noisy and too powerful for the size of the room. The remote to the TV didn't work. I have stayed in Hawaii many times and really think it is worth spending a bit more and staying at a hotel other than the ""Grand"". As each room is individually owned you can never be sure of the facilities. The room is only serviced every 3-4 days and they don't even renew the soap or shampoo even though I was there for a week.

I wanted to word it a bit differently. To start, the Castle Waikiki Grand isn't a traditional hotel. The studios, one + bedrooms, and suites are privately owned condominiums. At least most of them are anyway. The decor, the appliances, and the furnishings in the rooms are the sole responsibility of the condo owner. Therefore some rooms are going to be nicer than others. I had a room on the 6th floor, that overlooked the Honolulu zoo. The property is directly across the street from the zoo. However there were no weird odors or loud noises. In the mornings I would sit on the lanai and watch the peach colored flamingos walk around. From the lanai, I had a fantastic view of Diamond Head and the ocean. To the east there was Diamond Head, and to the west was the ocean. I couldn't have asked for a better view. In the mornings and the evenings, watching the sun rise and set from the lanai was absolutely beautiful. My studio had been renovated like a year before, and it was very nice. I did not see one creepy crawler in my room. It was clean, roomy, had fairly new furnishings, had a decent sized lanai, a queen sized bed, a full kitchen (no oven), dishes, utensils, pots and pans, microwave, a full sized fridge, 25 inch flat screen television with cable. The kitchen counters were granite top, the bathroom was clean and nicely done., I paid around $100/night. I went to the local grocery store (I rented a car), and I prepared most of my breakfast and dinner meals in the room and had my meals on the lanai as I watched the various people walking by and the flamingos roam around their area at the zoo.Granted, it did get a little noisy at night, but the noise didn't go on all through the night. The building has a burger joint on the lobby floor, and an alternative bar on the 2nd floor, mainly for men, but this was not a problem. I was there alone for 5 days and did not have a problem coming or going. I did not see, or experience anything weird while I was there. Sure the building could probably use a paint job, but it certainly is in decent shape. There is also parking provided for a fee. As this is moreso like an Extended Stay type of hotel, maid service is not available everyday unless you pay a nominal fee. If I am not mistaken, after 5 days maid service is provided at no charge.In my opinion, if you want to save money, this is the way to go. Just be sure to inquire about the room prior to booking. Ask about the decor, and the condo owner in general. However, if you're one of those who like to stay at overpriced hotel chains and pay a ridiculous nightly rate just for the sake of saying that you did, be my guest. Sure, you get a few more perks with these higher priced chain hotels, but in my opinion, the extra that you're paying could be used for something else. Think about it, when you're on business or vacation, how much time do you actually spend in the room anyway? I like the Castle Waikiki Grand, I'm considering going back before the year is out.","Los Angeles, California, United States","SeaGold168</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California, United States</strong>",4,4.0

I could have stayed down the beach for the same rate and been treated like a guest in a hotel. Stayed 5 nights and they never made the room up once and had to argue the last evening for 5 minutes with a security guard for shampoo and soap for my last evening! I am shocked by the staff. They never once smiled. They seem to go out of their way to avoid eye contact with anyone entering the lobby, exiting from the elevator to the lobby, etc. They only look up if you stand at the counter. Wifi keep dropping service so ended up having tp go to Starbucks to send emails. First moring, I brought back a cup of coffee and a bagel from the Starbucks and sat in the lobby and as I began to place spread on my bagel, a man with a dustpan full of cigarette butts told me I had to leave as there is no eating or drinking in the lobby! I said that I was aguest in the hotel. He pointed to an obsecured sign and said ""no food or drinks"" you must go! I was shocked that i had to leave the lobby! The man stared at me untill I got into the elevator to go up to my room. The room was in great disrepair. The deadbolt did not latch but the worst was the A/C unit that sounded like a Boeing aircraft engine even on low. I never could silence it but I needed the cool air so I went 5 nights with little sleep. I tried to Iron the second morning, as their was an iron in the closet but no ironing board. I placed my shirt on the flat bedspread to make due and yep, you guessed it, stained my shirt as the irons sole plate was so filthy, it transfered onto my shirt. Honestly, it looked like a thrift store purchased iron. The location cannot be beat as it is right across from the zoo, right at the beach and the start of the great shopping area. By the way I am smoker, and the smoking area on the side of the hotel in the alley had a chain across it most of the time that said ""sorry, area closed"". I was totally mislead by reviews of this place. There are other nearby hotels that you can have coffee in their lobbies and I bet are better places to stay.

The cockroaches were gone for one night, but on the next night I did see one or two (the small ones); the big ones did not appear. I would assume the big boys would appear in a matter of time. I wouldn't want to deal with that on an on-going basis.Besides the roaches, there's pretty much no amenities. They say it's not really a hotel, but condos that are for rent.The big plus is that the hotel is very close to the beach and to other cool things to do (the zoo, the aquarium, Diamond Head, the Saturday farmers market).

Homemade Hawaii style! Kona coffee is much better than the Starbucks located right next door to the Waikiki Grand. Walk down the road and hit up Honolulu Coffee House instead! You will be happy you did so! If you are gay it is neat to know that Waikiki is gay friendly! YES! And they share the hotel with an excellent gay bar named, Hulas.

Honolulu is FULL of expensive hotels that are nice, as nice as any downtown Hilton or Marriott or Hyatt Regency but no more. Honolulu also has its helping of laughably silly expensive hotels that have opulent lobbies, overpriced restaurants and pool terraces with guards to keep out the rifraff. The Castle Waikiki Grand Hotel is none of these. Its pool is not worth the trouble, it is behind the hotel and ground level and surrounded by tall buildings so it gets no sun, no big deal, you dont need the pool. The Grand has no restaurant or hair salon or gift shop. It does house Honolulu's biggest and best gay bar as well as a GLBT clothing/trinket shop. What the Grand has is an awesome spot at the end of Waikiki Beach, less than one block from the sand and one entire side of the hotel and the front has a view of the ocean and the extensive Honolulu Zoo and surrounding lush parkland. You wont get a view like this anywhere else except maybe at the Parc Hotel next door.This place is a mix of owned/rented small studio condo units that are lived in and hotel rooms. The rooms are small but clean. This building is old and in same cases looks like it needs some paint here or there. The lanais are perfect for all day sun and I mean from 7am-5:30p, nothing gets in the way of the sun since there are no more tall buildings across from the hotel. There is high speed wireless internet that worked fine and cable TV with medium sized LCD TVs- I stayed in two rooms, both had nice TVs. Both rooms I was in had refrigerators and microwave ovens, one did have a 2 burner mini stove and sink, the other one did not. All rooms have A/C which you will need if the day is sunny.Dont count on quiet in Honolulu, there is always street noise but my room on the 9th floor was much quieter than the one on the 4th floor.The front desk closes at 10p so dont find yourself needing something after that! The Grand is within walking distance of all of Waikiki shopping and dining, its just right around the corner in either direction. For quick food there is a Teddy's Bigger Burger right downstairs, its a Hawaii based burger chain. Starbucks is next door, McDonalds, Subway and Burger King are minutes away. The International Marketplace is about 10 minutes walk and there is a pretty amazing food court with every kind of Asian food you can imagine from Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Korean, sea food of every kind and, well, much more. In addition Lu Lu's is a nice place with lots of fresh sea food and salads right next door. The Aston has a nice terrace restaurant around the corner and a liitle further down is the main shopping area where you can find such appalling restaurants as The Cheesecake Factory, Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville and Cheeseburger in Paradise- I always say that there is nothing better after a hot day in the sun than a big creamy slab of cheesecake!Anyway, chooses the Grand for a great value and a great location and you wont even notice that the room doors like like they may be about 40 years old!","Fairbanks, Alaska","akranger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>",21,4.0

In the room was a tiny double bed (supposed to be a queen). The bedspread was old and worn with holes in it. The ceiling was falling to pieces, the drapes were tattered, the carpet was disgusting, the furnishings were old, the tub was grungy and looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years, the fixtures were falling off and the room smelled like death.

He gave us room 822 and said that was the only other room that was avaialble. We went back up to the 8th floor into the new room. This room was slightly better but not by much. It had a king bed with and old soiled mattress, the carpets were just as gross and the curtains had the same blood and ""body fluid"" stains as the frst room. The room was musty and the A/C didnt work. The room looked over the inner courtyard area which is surrounded in low income housing with some very unsavoury looking tenants. The only upside (if there is one) is that it had a flat screen tv. The window locks barely worked. By this time it was very late and we were tired from a long day of travel so we decided to stay the night and get another hotel in the morning. In the middle of the night the bed crashed through the frame and onto the floor. The noise from outside was very loud with crazies and druggies shouting at all hours of the night. I was itching all night and barely slept. We were up and checking out of that place at 6am. The new guy at the front desk made no effort to correct our stay nor did he apologize for the condition of the room. The only thing he said to us was to contact Priceline about a refund. It seems like they are well aware that this hotel is disgusting. We aren't usually picky when it comes to our accomodations but this is by far the worst place we have ever stayed. We went to the hotel a few doors down to use their internet access to book a room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village which was absolutely amazing! Do not stay here, spend the extra money and book a nice hotel, it saved our trip thats for sure.My only regret is that I forgot to take pictures to post with this review but all we could think about was getting the hell out of there.","Victoria, BC","craigers69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, BC</strong>",7,1.0

It's definitely not luxurious or even a 4 star hotel, but I felt it was clean (no bugs or other creatures, which was a big plus to me) and fairly large/comfortable (after we upgraded to a suite). The very best thing about the hotel is the view, especially from the 10th floor, which was where our room was located. Our first room (#501) was tiny, almost claustrophobic - especially for 2people (we would have been miserable there). So we decided to upgrade to a suite (#1009) and had much more room, incl 2 bathrooms - one for each of us. My favorite thing to do was relaxing out on the lanai while looking at the ocean or Diamond Head; there was usually a nice breeze, and it was lovely (except when the construction started at 6am at two sites across the street, the Zoo and a nearby hotel). We had several problems w/our stay -- incl no free Wi-Fi or internet access in the room, even though it was advertised; having to change our parking space every day; and the curtains in the room were in shreds making it impossible to open them to allow the breeze to flow thru. When we reported these issues to Jason, the manager, he was very helpful, deleting the parking charges and cost of room upgrade from our bill, and refunding my friend's charges for accessing Wi-Fi. All in all, if a lovely view/proximity to beach/cleanliness are important to you and you don't need free Wi-Fi/internet access or all the little amenities you get at a nicer hotel, then I'd recommend this hotel. I'd give it a 5 or 6 on a scale of 1-10.","San Diego, California","becca-n-sd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",5,3.0

The photos looked great. It's not a 5 star but we didn't expect that. The room we got on the 6th floor was smelly and tiny. Very old and tattered. It felt like a large closet. We requested an upgrade and they gave us a suite on the 10th floor for an additional $40 per night. The suite was large with a great view from the deck. The deck was shared and there were constantly people stroling up and looking in our room. One person even asked how we got the room and how much we paid. It was very weird. As thougth she had wanted it but coulnd't have it. The paint in the room was cracking. The curtains were tattered and torn and the drawstrings did not work. Not even one of them. The were cheap and dinjy. Most of the windows didn't work properly or wouldn't open and the AC was not enough to cool the room. There were no closets but had a good size wardrobe cabinet. The doors were held shut by toilet paper shoved in the middle. Noise was aweful and construction next door started at 6:00am.They promised free WiFi and there was none. On top of that the staff didn't know anything about that service. I got a lot of ""I don't knows"" Even pluging into the roughter didn't work. I had to pay for an outside internet service that my wifi found. Parking was a nightmare. We had to change parking spaces 5 times in the 4 days we were there. Someone was always in our assigned space. We even got questioned by security about why & where we were parked.Good points: No Bed bugs.The manager was very nice, professional, and attentive. He refunded our money for the upgrade and reimbursed us for the wifi we paid for...that is if the refund show up on my credit statement.

I guess some people have no idea what a decent hotel is supposed to look like, or their standards are incredibly low. All kinds of red flags should have gone up when I saw the price, but being a first time visitor to the area, and only spending two nights in Honolulu, I thought it would be acceptable. My impression while driving around the island is that very little is done to maintain properties, the homeless frequent public areas and parks, and perhaps, had I gone to a resort away from Waikiki Beach, I might have found better lodging. If you want a tropical paradise, don't waste your time in Honolulu. It is just a big city with palm trees, crumbling infrastructure, and shacks for residences. My final thoughts are that locals have no sense of cleanliness, lack manners, and love/breed roaches...Mahala, but no Mahala. Thank God, I spent the remainder of the vacation on Maui, otherwise, if this was my only impression of the fiftieth state, then may a lava spewing volcano cover it over.

Unit 614 is located next to the elevators but I never heard a peep - I was too busy sitting on the lanai gaping at the ocean view and occasionally turning to my left to gaze at Diamond Head to the accompanying sounds of the exotic birds at the Honolulu Zoo across the street. The unit itself is a cozy studio on Kapahulu overlooking Kapiolani Park (NOTE: this IS where the action is, with a gay bar on the 3rd floor. The noisy garbage pickup every morning can be annoying - pull the pillow over your head. It's over soon.) The kitchen has basic cooking facilities consisting of a microwave, two-burner hotplate, toaster, and coffeemaker plus a minifridge. Drawbacks: no kitchen sink, freezer compartment is very limited. Bathroom was nice and roomy with a square tub. The units in this hotel are individually owned, so you have residents and guests hsaring the space, which has the feel of a moderate-price apartment complex.

I lived in Honolulu many years ago, and this sweet spot is primo tourist location with all the perks. An ABC Store just outside the open-air lobby has most anything you want.

It's important to remember that the Grand is individually owned condo's which may or may not have been updated or renovated. I think it’s very important that you choose the right room and hence why such a variety of responses and reviews on trip advisor. I made my booking direct with the Grand and in my initial enquiry asked about the various rooms and which ones they would recommend. I specifically request a room with a balcony and was given room 501. My friends were booked into room 621 and said it was a dump and very old and outdated. Another friend of mine had room 622 which was well maintained with new furniture plus a slightly larger room, nice island kitchen, updated bathroom, but with no balcony or view. He was very happy with his room... it was clean and well maintained and obviously the owner had taken pride in his condo.Room 501 (my room) - consists of one large room with queens size bed and bar style kitchen all in one, separate hand wash basin and walk thru to toilet and shower / bath.On Arrival - Room hadn't been cleaned properly and had to request the main desk to send the cleaner up to wash the floors. My feet were black after walking around my room within 20 minutes. This was promptly taken care of and my floors were quickly mopped down. Bedding - was ok but I believe it could do with a new base and mattress and new pillows. There is no daily room service and for any change of sheets or towels you must now request this from the front reception office. Furnishings knocked around a bit and draws broken and not closing. Well equipped kitchen with full length fridge, coffee maker, cups, plates and utensils. I did wake up one night to find cockroaches in the bathroom. This didn't really disturb me as I'm aware how hard it is to eradicate these pests and is to be expected in tropical areas. If I had to complain it would be the noise generated from the restaurant on the ground level. Out the back they have some type of exhaust / fan that seems to run continuously. Not a problem during the day but at night it seemed to vibrate through my room. The Grand does have a pool, but I never saw one person use it. It’s not really in a prominent location and is rather run down and I believe the owners are looking at upgrading the pool area in the future.The reception and staff were all very friendly and helpful when requesting information. I wouldn’t say the Grand is a Gay hotel, but more gay friendly. There was a good mix of clientele ranging from young to older, gays, and couples etc all of which were very friendly. On the second level is the night club hula’s, which is a Gay night club and I don’t believe this interfered with the actual running of the hotel in any way. There are lots of little restaurants and ABC shops located in easy walking distance from the Grand. You can forget going to the Gay beach at Queens Beach or the Queen Kapolani Park. Unfortunately due to the current economical climate there are a lot of homeless people and beggars hanging around this area and actually camping there during the day and night. Whilst walking along the esplanade to Queens beach I was confronted by beggars asking for money and cigarettes constantly. I was even abused by a few when I declined. Definitely not an area to be walking around at night either as they bed down around the toilet blocks and throughout the park and a lot of them are drunk and it could be quite dangerous. The police are continually patrolling the area, but I guess there’s only so much they can do. I would suggest the beach at the lighthouse up at Diamond Head for guys looking for a safe area to sun bake. It’s about a 15 minute walk from Queens Beach.As a gay destination I don’t believe I would travel the distance to Hawaii again, it’s changed considerably since my last stay there almost 10 years ago. I would recommend the Grand to fellow travelers as long as you keep in mind that this is a budget accommodation and you get what you pay for.",Port Douglas,"Anthony R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Douglas</strong>",29,3.0

The unit is privately owned and taken care of in every way. We knew the view was great from the pictures on the website, but were could not have imagined it being so breathtaking in person. The unit had everything and I mean everything you could want during your stay. Flat screen TV, stereo, wireless internet, kitchen, couch, bar stools, A/C, a wonderfully decorated bathroom and a lanai that features the best view in Waikiki. The owners also let you use the boogie boards, umbrella, beach towels, beach chairs, goggles and blow up rafts free of charge.You're right across the street from the Honolulu Zoo (don't worry, there isn't a whole lot of animal noise, no worries), but that means your view is unobstructed from the ocean and Diamond Head Crater. There isn't another hotel across the street that you have to look at and no one looking in at you either. Every morning we woke up and had breakfast on the lanai and enjoyed a view that we'll never forget. This place is worth every penny and if we go back, there isn't another place we would stay.You won't be disappointed in Unit #908.

The room was not what we expected and the way we were treated with such disrespect from the night security (Morales) who just happen to shoved his name badge in my face (twice) when I asked his name to file a complaint about him after he threatened to call the police on us while we were finishing up a smoke on the sidewalk after coming back from a walk. We were in front of the building getting ready to go back up to our room 1008 (horrible view). We are on vacation coming from another state where we did not know the ""strict"" restrictions on smoking in front of this jail (Waikiki Grand) and the way the night time security approached us and threatened us was just crazy. We even told him we were staying there and all he said was ""I don't care, if I see you smoking here again I will call the police for trespassing"".The next morning we woke up to find a rules and regulations notice on our door with the smoking law highlighted. Disrespectful and embarrassing. There is NO mention of “no smoking” in the front of the hotel. We talked with the manager (Don) of the building, this guy was not any better, before we could even open our mouths to tell him what happened, he said are you in room 1008 and we said yes, he said I talked to the security and that's that law! When we finally told him about the incident, all he did was just try to make excuses for this guy. Not once did anyone say sorry. When we mentioned that we were uncomfortable and thinking about going somewhere else, he just said you are more than welcome to leave and stay next door (which we did). Instead of trying to make things better he made is worst. We ended up staying in the next building (Park Shore Hotel) and what a beautiful view and the customer service was outstanding, and it was cheaper and cleaner. What a difference this made in our last 3 days of our vacation. As far as the Waikiki Grand... I highly do NOT recommend this place, the staff is rude and needs to go, and they need some major cleaning service and a customer service oriented security (night shift). And BTW they have security cameras everywhere it is like being in jail not on a vacation",California,"zorro95051</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",2,1.0

No - it wasn't terribly close to the shops, but nothing is really too far away from anything else in this place! The front desk staff were nice and friendly, our room was a little worn but generally well kept. It was a little noisy, but the louvre windows were great for getting fresh air into the room.

It is an old hotel, built in the sixties, which has been converted into a studio condo hotel, in which private owners, own the units either for rental investments or for personal use. When owners are not using their units themselves, they can rent them through the Hotel service or through private management companies. I have stayed many times in the past 5yrs at this property, I have been to Hawaii 23 times. I can tell you from first hand experience, it all depends on who you rent from, whether or not you will have a good or bad experience. Let me explain. I have found the best units in the building are the ones managed by anyone other than Queens Surf!!! I recently stayed in unit 918, for 22 nights and it by far is the best most well maintained unit that I have had the chance to experience. Many times I have rented from Queens Surf vacation rentals and the majority of reviews I have read on this web sight are things that I have experienced as well. However, just to let people know, this is a great location in Waikiki, it is in the heart of everything, you can stay here with or without a car, just out the front of the building is all sorts of options for transportation, from taxi's to the major routes for the bus systems to shuttle services. As far as the hotel, you just have to do your research, you can find great units here, just don't limit yourself to only one option for the condo units. Google, Waikiki Grand, or look for other rental services at the Grand, you can find better and more reasonable units in this great quaint condotel property. I would suggest trying units 302,319,605 or 918. I have seen and inspected all of these particular units and they are of the best quality in this building and the most well maintained for cleanliness and well appointed with every amenity needed for your stay while in Hawaii. In the basement of the building there is also a laundry facility that is available 24hrs a day. This is very accommodating, now that the airlines are restricting the amount of luggage you can check free of charge. I truely hope this review will assist you in making your trip to Paradise a very enjoyable one. I have to say that I am a very picky traveler, I have a degree in the hospitality and airline career industry. I have worked many years in the business of travel myself and know what to expect for the value of my travel dollar. My only suggestion is once again, do your homework and research and I am sure you will enjoy your stay at ""THE WAIKIKI GRAND""!!!!!

The first room they gave me had a dirty tub that didn't drain properly, so I they changed my room after dragging my items to a second room, the second room had dried up urine on the toliet and they woke me up first thing the next morning doing repairs on the elevator which was right next to my room! I also forgot to add when I went to use the phone to ask about all the noise I found out that my phone in my room didn't work. I went down stairs and was told they would send someone up. Three hours later... after not hearing from anyone I went back down stair and was told the phone company would have to come out but could not come out until the next day to fix the phone so I would need to move a third time, to a THIRD room this room was better but it still had bad plumbing.

Everything was just fine, not a 5 star hotel but perfect for my husband and myself. The condo was clean, bed comfortable and the well equipped kitchenette made it convenient for breakfasts and quick snacks.The price was right for us who would rather spend the extra money on sight seeing and touring, etc. Just a note, yes there is a gay bar in the hotel on the 2nd floor, but we were up on the 9th so if there was any noise it certainly did not bother us. (And the hotel does not only cater to gays--there were other husband-wife teams there as well). We would recommend this studio to our friends and we certainly would go back.

Previous reviews of the Waikiki Grand highlight the importance of researching your accommodation to have a realistic expectation of what to expect.We spent 6 nights at the Waikiki Grand Hotel - I looked around and it was the best deal we could find for our budget (Originally I wanted to stay at the Royal Grove Hotel, but it was sold out). We were strictly trying to stay to a $100 per night limit. A few things to help anyone thinking of staying here.....Yes, there is a gay bar! But who cares really - you don't have to go if you don't want to. Some people are still very ignorant to the gay community - it's not like they are going to chase you down and convert you! In this day and age people really need to 'get over it'.Yes, there is noise - especially the garbage trucks! It happened twice during our stay. But hey - its $95 per night with housekeeping included! It's also Waikiki! Things happen at night here with people coming back from the nightclubs etc - stay outside of Waikiki if you can't handle the noise!Yes, the rooms are small. The carpet was very badly stained (we were in room 620) and the kitchen and bathroom was very small. But as I said before, we were using the room only to sleep and shower - it was clean and that's the important thing. However, as a note to Management the carpet needs to be replaced in this room as it is a bit of a joke, but not 'un-liveable'.If you are a young couple (of any sexual orientation) who would like some privacy and stay somewhere which is a few steps up from a hostel, this is the place for you! If you are older, have kids, don't like noise stay somewhere else and fork out the money for what you want!!!And remember..... you get what you pay for, so for $95 per night don't complain!","Lord Howe Island, Australia","Sublimerose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lord Howe Island, Australia</strong>",78,3.0

It would have been nice to know that the bar on the second floor of this hotel is known to the locals as the gay bar in Waikiki. There is even a gay flag on one of the poles at this hotel. Honestly, we felt like we were staying at a gay youth hostel. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children. The rooms are VERY small. My husband and I were very cramped just the two of us. We had both a queen size bed and a sitting area; except the bed was a murphy bed and you could either have the bed down and stack up the sitting furniture (some ended up on the lanai), or you could put the bed up and have somewhere to sit.We will not choose to stay here again, but it was a great learning experience for us as we learned to adjust our expectations and not let the bummer of a room ruin our vacation.",Illinois,"062703</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois</strong>",4,2.0

Also, the full kitchen *minus the oven* was perfect and we saved a ton of $$$ on food. That is a HUGE recommendation!

Buses run right in front of the Hotel, taxis are easy to grab, Star Bucks is next door and the Beach across the street.It is very easy to get to H-1 (the freeway).I will most certainly recommend this Hotel, I have put it at the top of my Waikiki hotel list, and I will return again.Barry Lawrence",Sonoma County California,"Barry113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sonoma County California</strong>",6,5.0

We saw two rooms and took one of them only because it had a king bed and the other had a double and that was all that was left. However, the bed had been slept in and the management told me to just pull up the covers as nobody had been there very long. So at 11 PM at night I asked for clean sheets and made the bed myself. The floor was tiled but felt dirty on bare feet and the white wall tile in the bathroom was all dirty. The tub had bad stains on it. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable and the spread was worn out. The bed and one table and two chairs(only) in the room looked like old Hawaii but too old. We were on the alley side of the hotel with three windows and there was noise(dumpsters, trucks, buses)all night long. This was room 420. We noticed other rooms that the maids were cleaning and some looked a little better than ours. It seems that in Honolulu one needs to spend a lot of money on a hotel or settle for an old seedy hotel.

The check-in counter persons were courteous; our check in and out was swift. We stayed on the 4th floor. The room was equiped with a fridge, microwave and a full kichenett (electric burners, sink, cooking utensils, pots/pans, plates, bowls, cups, knives, forks, spoons, etc. etc.), diswasher detergent, coffee maker and coffee packages. In addition to eating out, we used the kitchen quite a bit.The entire one side of the room was windows from top to bottom with double pane glass. It also has a temperature controled air conditioning unit. We like the breeze so we opened the windows most of our stay to allow the island air to circle the room. The room has recessed lighting in several places - a nice touch. The floor of the entire room and the bathroom is marble (or marble like?). It's a nice alternative from the usual carpet. The king size bed was comfortable.Room has TV and VCR player, alarm clock. Hot/cold water pressure was excellent.Breakfast (a muffin, croissant, fresh cut fruits and juice) were delivered daily with newspaper to our room.

I read every review before we left, and that is the problem. I read each of these reviews but I did not listen to them. I rationalized with thoughts such as: We do not need service; we do not care about a view; we do not expect anything from the hotel except a place to lay our heads in the evening; who knows these reviews may have been written by the competition… Here is our experience: Hotel location is excellent. We never saw the pool, with a beautiful beach across the street and a pool at home - we could not care less about a hotel pool. Never saw the sun deck, we did not need it or care about it. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. We never saw the Gay Bar; we have no issues with gay people, and there were no more obviously gay people in and around this hotel than anywhere else; most certainly they were not offensive. We had a city-view, which was not beautiful, but not a problem since we were gone from 8:00 a.m. until after dark. Our room was spacious enough, clean on the surface, some updates, such as nice tile floors, stainless steel refrigerator, granite counter top, stone back-splash, nice tile around tub. Sheets were clean and fresh, pillows were terrific, soft, clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. When we arrived in our room, we said: Okay, this is fine; this is what we would expect from a two-star hotel, and for the price—this will work well for a few days. Clearly, we understand the meaning of a 2-star hotel and the difference between this and a 5-star; perhaps those reviewers just have not traveled as much as we have. Then I saw the first one and absolutely nothing else mattered: a roach in the sink. Then I saw another in the bath basin; then several more in the bathroom, then more coming out of the trim. We complained at the desk and were given a can of “Hot Shot” roach and ant spray. The next day we asked for more spay and were told they had no more and that all hotels have roaches. The next day, we went to the grocery store and purchased more spray. This seemed to drive them out of the cracks and crevices and we had roaches on our phone, radio, on the doors, even one on the drapes. We were then down to one more night so we just toughed it out. We should have left as soon as we saw the first one. We thought it was an isolated incident and never dreamed we would be overtaken.As I said in the previous paragraph, nothing else mattered. I could not even drink a cup of coffee in this room, coffee that was purchased around the corner at a popular franchise coffee shop, much less eat the breakfast that was brought to our room each morning. I kept my clothes, makeup, flat iron, toothbrush and virtually everything else sealed in the bags in which I packed and took out only what I needed as I needed it. After we returned home, we left everything in the garage and disinfected each item piece by piece, including our baggage.In the future, we will pay strict attention to the comments of fellow travelers and not believe we know it all. Also in the future, if this is what the budget will allow, we will stay home.","Bedford, TX","Wiserinthefuture</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bedford, TX</strong>",1,1.0

There's also Hula's right downstairs on the second floor where you can get your gay cocktails on after the beach (Sun afternoons are fabulous). This was our third visit to Honolulu and my first review of the hotel. The hotel itself is OK. It's a little dated but the condo rooms have been renovated in many cases. Ours was incredibly tiny with no place to store our roller boards but it had been renovated with marble-esque tile in the bathroom and an updated kitchenette complete with LCD TV. We really could have used a radio/CD player. There was none to be found anywhere in the room. I blew the dust off the Gloria Gaynor CD for this trip and found that there was no where to play it. Our oceanview lanai overlooked Diamond head. Definitely the best feature of the room. The worst feature of the room was an air conditioner which was one of those window units installed right at the headboard of our queen size bed. Kind of loud right by head every night. Also very cold. I was gracious enough to let the boyfriend sleep on the other side of the bed because she complains a lot when the temperature is not to her liking. They've added a comp (or should I say camp?) continental breakfast delivey @ 8am. That was a nice touch. So girls if you're in Waikiki for the beach and not necessarily the luxury, I wholeheartedly recommend the Queens Surf.

If you're used to staying at the Hilton, you'll definitely feel like you've stepped down. If you're used to Motel 6, you'll absolutely love it. If you're used to mid-level hotels, you'll probably like it. Overall, it's a decent hotel: functional and kind of charming decor, relatively clean, and when it comes to location, it's one of the best places we've stayed in Oahu.My husband and I had an Ocean View room -- #611 -- with a spectacular view of Diamond Head and (of course) the ocean. Housekeeping was good but not perfect; the only ""gross-out"" moment was on the last day of our 7-day trip, when I thought I'd try the coffeemaker only to find out that the housekeeper hadn't cleaned out the filter from the last guest. Otherwise, the room itself was fine. We had a tile floor, so we bought flip-flops for walking around the room since we usually tracked at least a little sand in from the beach.Service was hit-or-miss. I wouldn't say they had the ""Aloha spirit,"" but they were friendly enough. Slow, though, and they tended to run out of beach towels. And, despite the threats of towing, when someone was parked in our spot, they just shrugged it off and said we could park in any open spot.If street noise bothers you, you should think about another hotel. This hotel borders one of the busiest streets in Waikiki -- not in terms of foot traffic, but rather cars, busses, trucks, etc. We slept with our window open because air conditioning affects our sinuses, but we're okay with street noise. The gay bar on the 2nd floor was not nearly as noisy as we thought it would be given how popular it is -- the building-wide lanai is always packed -- although we're really glad we weren't on the 3rd floor. The only time it was a bother was on Friday night, when for some reason there was a lot of yelling between the lanai and passer-bys on the street. As with the street noise, if alternative lifestyles bother you, think about another hotel.The usual line is, ""You don't go to Oahu to stay in your room,"" and we didn't. There's so much to see and do -- especially when you have a car and can travel all over the island any time you want to -- that we were rarely in the room. However, when we did choose to stay in, we were comfortable -- no weird smells, no funk on the sofa, no icky feeling from the bedsheets, etc. Our trip was amazing, and the hotel didn't detract from it at all. In fact, the location was a major bonus for us. We would stay there again.",California,"PKimMai</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",21,3.0

Waikiki was booked and no hotel rooms were available. Since our favorite hotels were full, we booked 2 nights through a travel engine on the internet . Never staying at the Waikiki Grand Hotel, we didn't know what to expect. I called ahead to alert them that we were going to arrive late in the evening. When we got there, we were confused by the Private Parking signs under the hotel, but parked anyway thinking it was for hotel guests. Out of the elevator the 3 of us adults came (me+hubby+daughter), only to see the Front Desk clerk say goodbye to the Security Guard, even tho she sees us arriving. We were greeted by the Security Guard with a, ""Driver's license, please."" Where's the aloha in that? Then we asked if we could park downstairs. He put the fear of God in us and said to move it immediately if you don't want your car to be towed away. We had to park across at the zoo or 5 blocks away. We ended up in the latter. Now it's 10:30p and we go up to the room where there's only a king bed ... for 3 adults? Hmmm, let's go back to the Front Desk. I explain the situation, he puts up both hands and says he can't do anything because he's only a security guard and he doesn't work for the hotel. There's also no manager until 9 am the next morning. By this time, steam hits the top of my head and I find myself yelling at the guard. All of a sudden he gets a brilliant idea to check the computer and call the FD clerk that left earlier. Luckily there was one more room that might be empty and daughter could sleep there until other accommodations could be made in the morning.To make a long story short, we got another room with a less than acceptable futon and double bed for the next night - hardly worth the money I was paying for. The parking nightmare never ended because the zoo, as well as other parking structures, were always full . No manager ever contacted us to make amends which goes to prove that there was no aloha extended at the Waikiki Grand Hotel. Don't stay there.

We stayed in Room 908 which is the Direct Ocean View unit run by Waikiki Retreat. The view is absolutely magnificent. The only thing between the room and the ocean view is a small slice of queen kapiolani park (and the room is way above the treetops). the ocean can be seen from every part of the condo (except the bathroom). There is also a stunning view of Diamond Head. Being so high up and off the main road, its fairly quiet--we could not hear the bar on the 2nd floor.The unit is competely renovated with a/c, tile floors, a murphy bed and a small updated kitchen. bathroom is also clean and neat. The whole unit is very stylish. It took us a while to figure out how to boil water on the cooktop but we were successful. A definite plus to be able to cook in the room--there is a grocery store about a mile away (we reserved a parking space in the hotel so had access to a car).The beach is a two minute walk--extremely convenient. The only slight negative is that it is small so its only suitable for singles or couples. But that is understandable for the price. we paid about $125/night including all taxes which I think is reasonable for the views.

The night watchman is the only help after hours and he only comes by the desk every 20 minutes. There's a walkie-talkie on the desk he said we should have used despite it being labeled 'for emergencies only.' All those flowers you see in the website photos are the same 2 bouquets. No flowers in the room as advertised.Room 511 had a lanai that appeared never to have been washed, tiles falling off, doors that wouldn't close, the fridge defrosted causing a flood for us to clean up, we spotted 5 different cockroaches in the room.... there is a 1 inch gap under most of the doors in the hotel so it must be a bug superhighway. The bed smelled of cologne. The elevators are creepy, the gay bar on floor 2 is VERY busy and therefore there's a steady stream of heavily perfumed people running around. If you're perfume allergic: Stay Away. PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE. The lot is too small and if there aren't spots you are directed to other hotel parking lots a good walk away. Add $10/day to the price for parking.The plus side: great to be on this side of waikiki overlooking the zoo. They were willing to negotiate to $100 per room a week from high season. A couple of the rooms may be nice below but stay on the 9th floor or above is our suggestion. The nice gal at the front desk refunded our money graciously.

There was a group of 7 loud, drunk guys outside until 4 in the morning with a prostitute, and someone else got beat up, which brought sirens and more noise. This avenue seemed full of drunks.

We wound up with room 911, which was wonderful!The view was great from the balcony, over the zoo, out towards diamond head, and right toward the ocean. You also overlook a park where we watched school groups eat and families play. Since he was there on business and I met him there for 3 days, we weren't in the hotel that much, which is how it should be for someone travelling to Hawaii. The room was great -- we had a coffee maker, refrigerator, microwave. The TV was small, but we never turned it on anyway. The room wasn't large, either, but for the two of us, as little as we were there, it was fine. We also realized on the second day that maid service is better if you tip. There was some balcony construction going on in the room above us, but there were signs warning us and encouraging hotel guests to schedule activities out of the hotel during certain hours (again, you're in Hawaii, who's going to be in the hotel all day??).

I was a repeat customer at this hotel and thought that we would try it again. After making an internet reservation though the Waikiki Grand website (they also go by the name of Queen Surf Rentals), we received an email confirmation to stay in Room 911 (one of their top-rated and nicest rooms). My wife and I (yes, we knew that it was gay-friendly, but that doesn't bother us as we're open minded Canadians) were very much looking forward to spending time in Room 911 as it is often described as one of the best in the hotel. When we arrived around 12:30 a.m. of January 23, I was greeted by a security person who not only couldn't find my confirmation, but also had difficulty communicating in simple English. After spending almost half an hour searching around the offices and making phone calls, it was finally discovered that my room was rented out due to ""an emergency"". Excuse me??!! The whole premise behind a reservation confirmation is to actually hold that room, not rent it out. Instead of enjoying a romantic 2 days in room 911, my wife and I were given room 509. Hardly the same room and quite frankly, a room that I wouldn't let my worst enemy stay in. Dingy, drab, and noisy. The next morning, we were moved to room 1002. Roomier and a nice view from the balcony. But the furniture was dirty and the place overall lacked any of the character, romance, or ambiance that we had looked forward to.  Quite frankly, I don't think these people can be trusted. No one ever bothered to contact me to explain why we were not given room 911 or offer any sort of apology or explanation. As far as I'm concerned, they breached the contract that we agreed to.","Calgary, Alberta","Connector27820</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Alberta</strong>",7,1.0

There is a gay bar on the 2nd floor, that is filled with locals. I don't think that straight families would have any issues, (I didn't) but if you are a homophobe stay elsewhere. Also, you need to know that a portion of this is apartments for 20 somethings. That is why you should BE SURE to request an oceanview room. These are the true hotel rooms. The location can absolutely NOT be beat. If you have teen children who want to roam, (WITHOUT YOU) the main drag of Waikiki is here, and the beach, park, zoo, and aquarium are right across the street.

The location can't be beat. It is in the the recently renovated Waikiki Grand. I strongly recommend staying in unit 911. Being on a higher floor, you had no street nosies, just supurb scenery. It had breathtaking views of the Ocean and Diamond head. It is the last building near the corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu, so you have an unobstructed view from your bed and lanai overlooking the lush greenness of Kapiolani park and you can have a beautiful view of the beach from this room. I can't say enough about this view because it has to be one of the best in Waikiki.The beach across the street is Queen's surf beach and the city has just completed new landscaping and paving so there is a beautiful new promenade to walk along . Also on weekends they have Free movies on the beach there. They set up a 50 foot screen and everyone gathers on the beach and buys food from the stands located temporarily for the show. You can even watch the movies from the Lanai of the room I was in. The 24 hour fitness facility is just around the corner on Kalakaua. So entertainment, shopping, movies, botanic gardens, aquarium, zoo are all within a 15 minute walk!There is a Denny's and Starbuck's on the corner, it is also where the bus from the airport stops. The Lyon Arboretum and its rainforest palm collection is a 5 minute bus ride away. You can stay at the Queens surf and have no need for a car rental. But if you do want to rent a car and explore the other parts of this beautiful island, there is parking underground here. That is very important because parking spaces are very rare in Waikiki and so it is difficult to find a space if it isn't provided and they ticket and tow readily in Waikiki.The Queens surf is a vacation rentals type of lodging.. These units are in the Waikiki Grand hotel and vary in size, view and price. Most of the units have been remodeled and have gorgeous limestone floors with track lighting, new tropical furniture, crown moldings and look very fresh and upscale. They all come with a refrigerator, coffee maker, beautiful duvet covered beds that are changed daily! The rooms are spotless!! There is a new fantastic laundry facility in the basement with a free color TV and large folding areas. The ocean is across the street. There is also an open air limestone floored lobby and it is a great place to sit and watch people.Besides from the best location and best view, friendly service and spotless rooms, the thing that makes this place outstanding is the price. The prices vary depending on how long you are staying, if you need a full kitchen, or want that million dollar view of the extinct diamond head looming over the lush tropical greenness of the zoo and Kapiolani park. Rooms go for between $60-$125/night. That is incredible! Just explain to one of the people at the front desk your needs, (Liz is great) if you are on a budget or whether you want to go all out and they will make sure that you get a wonderful room at the absolute BEST value. For the view, cleanliness, location, facilities, and price it is unbeatable. I've had friends that have been back twice and with those prices were able to stay longer the second time and really felt at home, comfortable, beautiful views, everything a convenient short walk away. It made for a very enjoyable vacation. With all the upgrading and new landscaping the city has provided to the nearby area, this part of Honolulu has become wonderful.

However, it is the only one (in my opinion) with the best location. The check-in process at the front desk was the same as any hotel with friendly and courtesy service. But do not consider booking anything but an ocean-view room, which actually faces the park more than the ocean. The view from you balcony of Diamond Head every morning as you have coffee and the view of the surfers returning to their cars in the evening is well worth the small difference in price from the city view room. The imaculately clean and white studio we had (#414) was perfect with a tidy kitchenette with every possible item of utensils, dinnerware and cookware...plus a coffee pot and microwave and fridge. We do agree with the earlier review that there is some noise from the elevator, but that happens in any hotel. We requested, and received promptly from the front desk, a small fan which we turned on at night to mask outside noise. It worked perfectly and our sleep in the very comfortable bed was undisturbed until the sun started streaming in the next morning. Hulas, the largest gay bar in town, was on the second floor but the music from the club never disturbed us. In fact, we could not hear it even when we were on the balcony. And it was very convenient to pop in for a drink or a cruise whenever we wished. Queens' Surf beach is a 5-minute walk away and the execellent and very-gay-friendly W Hotel bar is a 10-minute walk. Situated on the far East end of the the main drag in Waikiki, the property is out of the press of the main tourist trade. Whenever you are ready to head to the beach, the front desk hands out large towels and beach chairs. They are yours for the day free of charge. There is also a large and recently renovated coin laundry room in the basement with new washers and dryers that have digital timers, plus a large flat-screen TV to help pass the time. This property was the perfect place to relax, play, or just enjoy the best of the beach and the city.

I chose that hotel over others because I was able to get a great view of Diamond Head, the Honolulu Zoo, Kapapilani Park and the beach for much less than other hotels in the area. The room had been recently revamped and was quite large. The bathroom was very nice as well. Surprisingly, they had very nice soaps, shampoos and conditioners in the room every day. We had an opportunity to talk with the front desk staff and the resident manager. Both were very accomodating and helpful. However, that is where my compliments stop. For starters, you need to know that this is the only gay owned and operated hotel on the strip, and as such, you have alternative clientele. I never felt uncomfortable because of it, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. Secondly, the hotel is old and the walls are VERY, VERY thin. My room was adjacent to the elevator shaft and I could hear the elevator all the time and the ""ding"" every time the door opened. I could also hear my neighbor's alarm clock going off, my neighbor's phone ringing and most of the conversations that went on in the hallway. The weekend road noise was a bit much... but then again, I should have expected it. The hotel is right at the end of the main strip in Honolulu. We could also clearly hear the monkeys in the zoo calling at all hours. I ended taking a sleeping pill and putting a towel at the bottom of my door each night and that helped with the sound issue a lot. The bed wasn't terribly comfortable either, but I am not a fan of hard beds. If you don't mind them, you won't be bothered by this one. There is daily maid service, but we had to leave a note asking her to change the sheets. She didn't always sweep/vacuum the floor either so we had some left over sand on the floor most days. Overall, I would recommed this hotel if you are a person who uses hotels to simply ""crash"" at the end of the night and you're not picky about the creature comforts. If you have an expectation of what a ""nice"" hotel should be, stay somewhere else. If you are traveling on business, pick some place else. This really isn't the right hotel for you.

Since my first stay in the year 2002 Queens Surf has dramatically changed! The hotel management is now at the ground floor front desk of Waikiki Grand which it used to be on the 8th floor. I find that great because they have someone working there almost 24hours a day. The new staff are wonderful and the rooms are always very peaceful. I think the new managers name is Liz she couldn't of made are stay more enjoyable with the daily paper on are door step and even a free mai tai drink at Hulas. This will always be my place for a great vacation treat.,"Santa Barbara, California","Trek30026</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Barbara, California</strong>",8,4.0

Located at the east end of Waikiki, which is now highly desirable, the rooms overlook Diamond Head, Kapiolani Park, and panoramic views of the beach and ocean beyond. Most of the rooms have been purchased and converted into studio units and are now privately owned. It's like ""home away from home"" with many more amenities than major hotels, at a fraction of the cost! Great restaurants and great shopping all close by! Great gay bar, ""Hula's"", located on the 2nd floor. International customer base. Great place for gay men to stay! Beautiful lobby, and many more upgrades currently underway! I highly recommend it to everyone! If you want a great place in the heart of all the action, the Waikiki Grand is it! Super friendly atmosphere and a great place to have the vacation of your dreams...at an affordable price!

The view of Diamond Head from our room could not be bettered, but the room was small, the a/c noisy, the Venetian blinds did not work and the balcony furniture was filthy. We paid USD 90 + tax. which was not good value for money. We would not stay in this accommodation again.","Paphos, Cyprus","Robin H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paphos, Cyprus</strong>",58,2.0

Our room, however, was tiny but clean. The lanai was a joke as the view was out the back of the hotel looking at other hotels and a trash dumpster. Incredibly noisy and the trash truck came by early every morning it seemed. Rooms on the front side may be better. After a week here we had claustrophobia! Don't expect it to be like the rooms to which you are accustomed on the mainland.","Brookings, Oregon","Road37169</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brookings, Oregon</strong>",11,2.0
