We’ve been looking forward to our stay at the Carlyle for a very long time. This gem of a property in the Upper East Side is truly remarkable. If you’ve watched Always at the Carlyle or read any of the reviews you have an idea of just how special this place is. I believe it has ~190 rooms, yet it feels utterly like a boutique property. The hotel was completely sold out yet it never felt too crowded at any time. Yes the bar was full but the energy was palpable. The whole property is quaint, yet energetic. We were booked in a Superior room with a King bed. It was one of the recently renovated rooms and we absolutely loved everything about it. The bed was extremely comfortable. It had a huge TV which you could maneuver to the position you would like. The bathroom, albeit a little small, was perfectly adequate for us with some amazing bath products. However the real reason we fell in love iwth this place and why we will definitely come back to The Carlyle is the staff. Wow! We had never stayed here. We have never met any of these people. Yet after only two nights we were so very sad to leave. From the jovial doorman, to the front desk staff, to housekeeping, to the delightful elevator gentlemen, we felt like we were at home during our entire stay. Let us not forget the AMAZING concierge! They assisted us in the months before we arrived with dining reservations and holiday activities as well as several times during our stay - everyone was such a delight to work with. I’m not sure it would be appropriate to say this is a hidden gem but maybe in a city the size of New York it still is. The location was simply perfect. Just far enough away from the craziness of mid-town in the Upper East side. What’s not to love about the Upper East side besides a $28 grilled cheese? Its truly an Oasis. Boutique shopping and amazing restaurants all around. Just 2 minutes and you’re in Central Park; within five minutes you’re inside The Met. You feel incredibly safe everywhere you go. We loved taking the long walk through the park down to Wollman ice-skating rink and into Mid-town. We cant give anything but praise to this amazing property. Christmas is a truly magical time of year in New York City. Staying at the Carlyle made it even more so. We can’t wait to visit them again!

Entire experience was fantastic. We have stayed at other Rosewood properties and this one did not disappoint!We loved all the special Carlyle touches. The elevator attendants were so old school.We especially wanted to thank Mustafa Sukkar, night manager for the smooth arrival and getting us right into a table to Bemelmans Bar on check in night just in time for us to order food off the menu (Flight was delayed by two hours so we arrived to the hotel a bit later than planned). The piano bar band was even notified it was our anniversary and recognized us with song that very first night.Great breakfast in the hotel restaurant, had the feel of a private club. Since we had booked with AMEX platinum fine hotels and resorts we got a lovely room upgrade and the breakfast was complimentary.On our final night of our stay we were lucky enough to get a table for two to catch Woody Allen’s Jazz band playing their regular Monday night gig at the very intimate Cafe Carlyle. My wife had a champagne and I got to try the special Carlyle Manhattan. The room we were in was the newly renovated section and was well appointed complete with shower and bath and even a walk in closet. Regrettably the higher floors were under construction (which will be great for a future stay)Even with the beyond impeccable accommodations and service what makes the Carlyle shine is a fantastic location. The place has a great neighborhood feel and is “around the corner” just blocks away from the Frick, The Met and the Guggenheim. Central Park is just “down the street” a block away. Given that we stayed early fall with great morning weather, I was able to grab a morning run in Central Park two mornings of our stay so I never got to see the gym facilities (which would probably get more use from winter travelers). Either way when we went out one night, to the circus that is Times Square, to catch the musical Hamilton we really appreciated the contrast of the serenity of “our neighborhood” at the Carlyle. Great meals were also had “in the neighborhood” at Flora Bar (literally down the street), Jo Jo, and Bar Italia a little further down Madison Avenue.My wife and I will definitely return.

Further, the bottom sheet was scratchy and uncomfortable and the pillow covers were slick so that they moved from where we placed them, either under our head or between knees.The second issue was that my wife had a hair (not hers) in her yogurt at breakfast. The waiter saw the hair and mentioned it, but did not apologize. If the manager was told, he also did not mention it or apologize.A smaller issue is the lack of outlets in the room. Further, the one I found and plugged my phone into did not work, so my cell phone's battery was dead in the morning.Also, the wallpaper had peeled and a part of it was removed in the ""recently refurbished room.The hotel is lovely and the staff unfailing polite and accommodating.

Could not recommend the spa enough - all the staff are very well qualified and I had a fantastic experience at both the spa and the hair salon.Only issue is that apparently the whole of the 9th floor was having problems with their heating/cooling system (same in the room occupied by the rest of my party)... rooms were pretty chilly and the front desk attempted to solve this remotely but sadly unsuccessfully.

I was so wrong! I used an American Express Platinum card promotion to book my first, 3-night stay at the Carlyle due to its location near my destination. The lobby is still a glorious marble with the traditional fixtures, and the Café and Bar have retained all of their traditional décor and somewhat formal, 5-star service. However, my newly renovated room (1107) was light, bright, and the fixtures and decor were modern and perfectly laid out. Everything was so elegant and well-thought-out, I could easily have stayed for a week or more. We also found the service was extraordinary - friendly and warm but still suited to the hotel's elegance and history. The Front Desk, old-world elevator operators, housekeeping staff, and restaurant staff were all fantastic - genuinely interested in us as well as in upholding the Carlyle's service. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but the menu included traditional, healthy, AND fast alternatives that suited all lifestyles. My Amex promotion included a break on spa services, which were highly professional (my eyebrows have never looked so good :-) Lastly, the hotel's location right in the heart of the Madison Ave shopping district (and acccessible to the 77th Street subway station) can't be beat - it's both super-quiet and super-accessible. You can be comfortable here whether you're on a business trip or casual vacation - I will definitely be back.

The hotel embodies wonderful Upper East Side New York glamour, just as we’d envisaged. A discreet entrance just off Madison Avenue leads to the small, elegant lobby decorated in Art Deco monochrome with splashes of golden velvet.While the hotel is exclusive we found the service friendly and attentive throughout. And everyone seems to be greeted with “nice to see you” whether it’s your first or hundredth visit. The Carlyle is being subtly refurbished in parts but cleverly all the classic features that make it special are still there including the famous Bemelmans Bar and the elevator attendants.Our room was one of the recently refurbished ones and successfully blended classic with contemporary. There were some lovely touches such as Central Park murals and quirky rabbit objects reminiscent of the Bemelmans bar downstairs. The room wasn’t huge and the bathroom a bit tight but that’s usual for New York and the beautiful décor made up for it. We enjoyed fabulous breakfasts every morning in the chic Carlyle Restaurant. And dinner there was the icing on the cake of our stay. We were given the type of table we’d requested beforehand (a corner banquette) and the classic menu and slick service matched the stylish setting perfectly.For exploring the Upper East Side the hotel’s location was also superb. We had the Met museums and Central Park right on our doorstep and of course the shops of Madison Ave. There are newer, trendier hotels in more fashionable parts of New York but for sheer class this is hard to beat.","London, United Kingdom","GRandJK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",56,5.0

He was indifferent if we ordered coctails in the lounge or waited to be seated in the main dining room which appeared dingy (as though they sold off the elegant furnishings that they used to display in pictures. I ordered a vodka martini which was so watered down that I had to ask them to replace it with a glass of white wine. The waiter said he’d have to first get the bartender’s permission first and so he did.after entering the main dining room, We both ordered the lobster bisque soup which was served with about a teaspoon of diced lobster in the center of a small bowl and then elegantly served with a circularly poured red liquod that tasted like Campbell’s tomato soup flavored with maybe the shells of lobster. We put it aside after a few spoonfuls and I received the “roasted” beet salad that seemed light on the “roasted” beets and cheese but the tiny bits of Hazle nuts were the best feature of the small dish. That was enough of the dinner that we wanted. The waiter was curious enough to ask if we didn’t like the soup and we told him that we didn’t like the soup at all and it was left at that. Excluding the price of the drinks, our bill amounted to $ 130. For soup and salad. When we left, we headed to our neighborhood for take out pizza because we were both very hungry and shocked by the Carlyle exlierence!!!",,Helene h,2,1.0

We were in town for a friends party Saturday night and decided to rally our friends for a table at Cafe Carlyle on NYE and thought it would be fun to stay at the same hotel we were at for NYE. We were even so excited about it we watched ""Always at The Carlyle"" and forwarded it to our friends we were spending NYE with to get them excited. Well......the reality was - although the public spaces are elegant and chic the room #2306 that we had was the most disgusting room we have ever stayed in. Upon arrival to the 23rd floor there was an almost dead orchid with yellowing leaves. We enter our room and get settled and notice many cracks in the ceiling. There was even peeling paint or plaster that had fallen into the ceiling light fixture. I tried to adjust the lights so they were all at an even medium wattage and was told by the engineer that one light had to be manual because the dimmer switches didn't work. There were at least 10 stains in the carpeting that had been bleached out and obvious. One of the windows was a total cloudy white from some kind of water damage. There were literally water marks in the window treatment fabric from leaks. The little enclosed balcony had bubbling, discolored and peeling paint which looked like water damage over many years. The TV cable didn't work so we had to call the engineer for the 2nd time. Then......just when I wanted to have a glass of champagne and take my bath- all the water filling the tub was a dark brown- like onion soup brown. Now our 3rd call to the engineer after the brown water had been running for 20 minutes and they let us use another room down the hallway to take a bath. I forgot something and by this time I literally just wanted to give up I hated this hotel so much. Interestingly the water filling this 2nd tub in another room was a light green. This also meant we were now rushed to get ready for the NYE party downstairs that we were attending at The Cafe Carlyle. We stay at many elegant places around the country and this room reminded me of the cheap hotels and youth hostels I stayed in traveling around Europe for the summer in College- hence ""The Carlyle Hostel"" was the most appropriate title I could think of-","Chicago, Illinois","Jim K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,1.0

I asked the front desk about room service upon checking in and was told that the kitchen was being remodeled and there was no food or room service available. Then the next morning, much to my surprise, I go down to the lobby and see a restaurant full of people eating breakfast. When I asked the staff about it, they said ""oh we serve breakfast everyday"". I found this to be disappointing and confusing. On a separate occasion I called the front desk to have some ice sent to my room and I was told no, we don't have anyone here to do that until after 11am. So I went down 19 floors to the lobby and asked the front desk how to obtain ice, and was told just call us from your room and we will send it up. I found the consistent contradictions of this historically fantastic hotel more than disappointing and upsetting, especially since I was staying at the Carlyle for my wedding. Coming from Orlando, FL which happens to be very hospitality oriented, I had high expectations for the Carlyle.

It was meant as both an accommodation and a history experience. It certainly delivered on the latter but I think it could use some improvement on the former. I will say that there truly is something special about stepping through the doors and into the beautiful intimate lobby, and riding up the old school elevators with the uniformed attendant, the whole place feels like a film set and almost a magic relic in the modern world. Location 4.5/5: This would not be the place to stay for a first time visitor (I would recommend Nomad/Midtown for that), but the location itself is fantastic is you are clear on what you are looking for. It's a stone's throw away from major museums, shopping on Madison (much better than the crazy busy ones on 5th Ave and in Soho), The Park and sufficiently close to a subway. It was also faster than expected to take a car downtown if you are going down Lexington (a 2min walk away). What it makes up for in maybe midtown convenience is a beautiful sense of peaceRoom 4.5/5: I had a room in the higher tower section and it was renovated. The room was bigger than expected, wonderfully laid out and proportioned. I want to call out the ample storage space (not done enough by most hotels) and the heavenly bed! The temperature control was great and quiet – which I also want to call it because it’s not always the case in older properties. I felt that the reservations team also did their best to accommodate my room requests so really really happy with the service there. The room was also very bright and light is SUCH a treat in NYC and the view was really something. I definitely encourage you to pay more if you can to ensure that you can get a brighter room (higher floor, not facing a courtyard), the building is one of the highest in the area, so once you get above a certain floor you are rewarded with some great views (particularly if you face downtown or the park), mine room was a corner facing East and North. The one thing that wasn’t perfect is that the bathroom – while beautifully renovated, is really tiny. Two people could not fit in the bathroom, this might be just my room so you can always inquire and ask for a bigger bathroom when you can. The shower pressure and the toiletries are excellent and I really commend them for doing the best with the space. Ambience/Amenities 4.5/5: The hotel has a quiet intimate luxury that exudes more a private residence than hotel (because it also is). It delivers on the home away from part, and did not feel like a large hotel. The elevator attendants were for the most part quite friendly and such a fun novel experience! While lobby is beautiful and common areas generally well maintained, I think there is definitely opportunity to for a refresh. For example, the bathrooms by the restaurant felt cheap compared to the rest of the property. Nothing glaring but I can see why they need to undergo a renovation. However, the biggest selling point here is truly the discrete, elegant and quite luxury of the ambiance. Service 4/5: Overall very great service from almost everyone with the exception of the breakfast staff which really put a huge damper on what would have otherwise been an excellent stay. I want to thank Jamie Lee at the front desk for trying her best to accommodate all my needs, including early check in. A great pre stay experience is always valued. Front desk, bellman, and the elevator attendants were all very friendly. Housekeeping/turn down was also excellent. I also had a facial at the spa which was really really fantastic and I would likely go again next time I'm in NYC even if I dont stay at the hotel. Food/Drinks 3/5: I am only giving this a 3 because Bemelmans was such an excellent experience. Even if you dont stay at The Carlyle, try to go to Bemelmans - I've recommended it to everyone and will definitely go back. The ambiance is simply phenomenal. Breakfast at the restaurant was appalling, I had booked a breakfast inclusive rate and came down for the breakfast buffet, and after I was seated and provided my room #, I went to fetch an orange juice and took a quick scan of the offerings (which were decent enough but nothing to write home about) before going back to my seat. When I actually got up again to get food about 5min later, they were already putting everything away. I thought this was just awful service because never did the maitre'd OR my server mention that they were going to be putting the food away basically immediately after I sat down for a buffet - had I known I would have either hustled to get my food or just ordered room service. A simple ""FYI we will be happy to seat you but we'll be putting the food away in 5min"" would have been basic service courtesy. I wasn't feeling well so I ended up just going back to my room and didn't bother bringing this up, but it felt like a complete disregard for customers especially considering that had I not had breakfast in my rate, they likely would have try to bill me $45 for it. It was a disappointing way to end what otherwise was a great stay.Overall I would still consider staying at this property again.",,Monica W,21,4.0

It was made clear to us that the hotel is undergoing major renovations until early 2020 upon booking but this didn’t take away from our experience at all as they have carefully segmented out the construction so it isn’t noticeable at all. They also made the entire contents of the minibar free since the kitchen was closed and there was no in room dining. We were fortunate to stay in a room that had been renovated in the last few years so we found our furnishings and accommodation to be one of the nicest we have ever experienced. We love the location as well as you are one block from Central Park, amazing shopping at your doorstep, close proximity to the train and great bus access right at the doorstep. If you are looking to stay in the hottest hotel in the hippest neighborhood you may enjoy other hotels more but for us you can’t beat the history and glamour of the Carlyle.

We were upgraded from a deluxe room to a suite which was wonderfully spacious (except for the bathroom) and generous on their part. This historic hotel was on our bucket list and glad to have crossed it off. The service was fantastic and staff were all gracious hosts. It is an old hotel currently under renovation. Our suite was in need of one of those make-overs. The upholstery was falling apart and the furnishings were of another era. The bathroom was also old-school - when people didn't value space and luxury. You couldn't swing a cat in it. Single sink, toilet, and tub with wall shower head, a tight little room that seemed out of place with all the space in the suite. Would like to go back once the reno's are complete. But will ask about the bathroom size etc. before doing so.All said, it was a charming hotel with great service oriented staff. Woody Allen's band happened to be playing the night we were there.

The Carlyle is a very historic hotel with a storied reputation. However, in many ways it's age shows in the rooms and certain interiors. The room was comfortable, but definitely in need of an update...finishes were old and worn and not up to the standards of other Rosewood properties. I'm sure it was great in the 1990's. Otherwise, the amenities provided were what one would expect in a 5 star hotel. Kiehl's products, plush towels robes and slippers. Since the hotel is renovating their kitchen, snacks, soft drinks, and beer were offered from the mini bar for free, which I appreciated. One thing the hotel does offer that many other New York hotels do not, is great views. My room was on the 27th floor and had a beautiful view up Madison Ave, out over Central Park and the Met Museum. The hotel lobby is very beautiful....and if every part of the hotel was as well kept as that space I think the Carlyle could be great. However, until they full update the rooms to standards that meet their prices I will be taking my business elsewhere in NYC. I think that Rosewood should look at some its neighbors for inspiration...other UES hotels have been recently renovated to great success. The Lowell Hotel was tried and outdated and then was renovated by Michael Smith and is now one of the chicest spots in town. Needless to say, the Bemelmans Bar is still fabulous.

Late diners, housekeeper was anxious to just provide waters and ask"" you are all set, right"" with no offer to return even after informing her we had dinner reservations at 9pm.Room service food was average, arriving hot. Breakfast room service waiter was wonderful. Night room service needed some professional training, lackadaisical in nature with no semblance of professionalism.Upon check-out, porter was prompt. Met him in lobby, provided him with a gratuity and I was informed the luggage was loaded in the car to the left of exit by the doorman. Upon exit, there was once again no staff, no vehicle but there was one piece of our luggage sitting on the sidewalk with the shoppings bags hung over the extended handle.Rosewood markets themselves as a top luxury brand, known for service and well appointed interiors.

I was upgraded to a suite because my room wasn't ready when I arrived. Higher floor facing east so the view was of rooftops, but the suite itself was large, comfortable, and clean. The minibar was stocked with things I liked, they kept bottles of water on each nightstand and the toiletries were Keihl's, which is what I normally use. Service was flawless. From the prompt elevator operators and bellmen to the friendly front desk staff, every request was fulfilled immediately. When I was concerned about my suitcase being overweight for my flight, they promptly brought out a scale to confirm.On this visit, I had breakfast in the restaurant, drinks at Bemelmans, and tea in the Gallery. (I've been to the Cafe Carlyle several times in the past but not on this trip, as much as I would have liked to see Lena Hall.) The restaurant and Gallery were quiet and relaxing even though there were a lot of guests. The breakfast buffet is terrific and my friend who's a tea aficionado was very pleased with the extensive selection available. I know the hotel's history and the long list of important people who have stayed here, and I can see why.

You don't forget that type of attention.Therefore, when we planned a family 5 star trip back to New York, we knew we were going to book The Carlyle Hotel. We booked a 2 bedroom Deluxe Suite for 4 nights, but when we arrived at check in time, we were told that the people in our suite had a late check out and hadn't left yet. The staff took our bags up to a ""temporary"" suite for our use, and we were told we were being upgraded to a Premier Suite. Although it took a couple of hours to get into our actual Suite, it was worth the wait (and we went for a planned neighbourhood walk anyway during that time). The upgraded Premier Suite was very large (full kitchen, dining room, living room, 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms), and gorgeously recently decorated and full of antiques. The ambience and views were so spectacular (and there was a grand piano) that we didn't turn any of the 3 tv's on in 5 days. We had room service for dinner on two nights when we had early concerts to go to. As the room service comes from the menus available in the hotel's own restaurants (The Carlyle Restaurant, Bemelman's Bar and Cafe Carlyle), the food was first class and piping hot, not to mention on time and served with such attention to detail. Once again, we were offered the hotel's house limo on our two concert nights by the doormen, as they were available.There are so many people to thank from the front desk, to the housekeeping people, concierge, doormen, bellhops and elevator men. We felt these loyal employees all made us feel that we really were in a home away from home and not just in one of many 5 star hotels in New York. The Carlyle should never change it's winning formula and much is due to the employees, and also the beautiful upkeep of the main floor with the shining lobby, The Carlyle Cafe, Carlyle Restaurant, The Gallery and Bemelman's Bar. Interior design of the suites and guest rooms is also to be mentioned, as the furnishings and linens are so comfortable, and interiors were beautifully and noticeably updated in our Suite.I could go on, but needless to say, we can't wait for our next trip to New York and stay at The Carlyle!

It was mended after a couple of days, but no offer of apology or recompense was made. On the same day I was physically pushed out of an elevator (which I waited a very long time for) by one of the staff who told me that he had another guest’s luggage to move. I spoke to the duty manager who told me he would “file a report” and then explained that the general manager was available by appointment only. In all the circumstances, my opinion is that the facilities and the service at this hotel far fall below what i was promised and that the hotel must fall back on fairer pricing to justify what has sadly become a tired and generic experience.

The hotel is in an excellent location to walk around the east side of manhattan and the presence of elevator operators and the intimate lobby makes this place feel more like a residence than a hotel. We had booked two connecting rooms for us and our 2 kids at a very reasonable weekend rate, and found ourselves upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite that included a steinway baby grand piano in the living room and 2 terraces. Amex Platinum might have had something to do with it.The rainforest shower was one of the best I've ever had especially considering it was on the 15th floor of a tall building. Bathroom amenities were top notch. The suite was decorated to simple taste and is a bit dated, but it was spacious and comfortable especially if you don't like particularly plush surroundings. It also featured a nice assortment of art and it is worthwhile to spend a bit of time perusing the book in the room telling you about the hotel's history. I had a spa treatment and the facility is classy; the fitness center is adequate and nothing out of the ordinary. The evening scene in the hotel was hopping at the bar and the cabaret. We greatly enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet; every item was elegant and perfectly prepared and the food on the buffet was fresh, even the eggs. i was a bit perturbed being charged $11 for a side of avocado (usually hotels provide it gratis upon request), but at least it was a very good one. Hotel was very nice about extending our late check-out to almost 6pm. The telephone operator (i think it was miriam) who took my wake up call at midnight was just as cheerful at 8am the next morning and wins my award for sounding really great after working the midnight shift. Kids got a nice package of amenities and we received nice cookies, sweets and fruits in the room.

However, it is also not a particularly good one either and it is far from being on a par with the other top hotels in the City. What's a little annoying is that the hotel still thinks it's comparable with places like the St Regis or the 4 Seasons but its dated look, its lack of communal space and the fact that it seems to welcome pets better than it welcomes humans means that no matter what they do right (and they do a lot right) still leaves you thinking you are being short changed. Their pricing is also nothing sort of ridiculous especially in the spa, who seem to fill out numbers just for fun. The main dining room is like something from the 1970's and although the food is better than adequate you just feel like the entire place is caught in some kind of a time warp. As part of the Rosewood group i was really looking forward to staying here, and although its not a bad hotel I certainly did not feel that it was worth the money or that it was a place i would rush back to. The staff look bored, is there really a need to have a staff member operate every elevator? In the age of smartphones, I'm pretty sure guests can press a button in an elevator. They really need to give this place a decent makeover and more importantly provide guests with a proper lobby as there is no where to go and just sit and relax, and in a hotel that charges as much as this one, its just not acceptable.","London, United Kingdom","steven n</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",18,3.0

When I asked the man who operated the elevator, I was told the space just outside of these lifts with a couple of sofas was where one could sit!! Really? Small and uninviting, only 3-4 people was all this small area could accommodate!I pretended to go to the Spa to look at their different treatments so that I could sit somewhere!Our suite was a fair size but the bathroom was old fashioned, tiny and lacked any modern amenities.Claustrophobic and inconvenient. Too much space is dedicated to storage areas.The breakfast is served in a very glamorous restaurant with at least half a dozen waiters hovering with nothing to do. On a couple of occasions we were quite shocked to hear them arguing very loudly with each other. One senior waiter asked another if he could get coffee for a guest to which he replied, ‘Why don’t you get it yourself?’. The waiters looked unhappy and moody accept for one who was a Frenchman. He was very helpful and it was a pleasure to talk to him.Not my idea of a hotel with such an amazing location and past!

This is the ultimate New York experience. When you walk in the door the second time you are greeted by name. The elevator operators (yes!! elevator operators) know what floor you are on. When you go to the dining room they know who you are. Fresh flowers in the room, a comfortable bath (and we had a powder room also), and quiet. We were on the 14th floor and had no street noise whatsoever. We found it very easy to get a cab, unlike our last stay (52nd at 5th) where we could never get a cab.So, the reasons to go to the Carlyle:1. Beautiful well appointed rooms, of a nice size for NYC. Beautiful wood floors, restful colors, comfortable furniture and bed. Just being in the room was relaxing. Well maintained.2. Very few rooms on a floor so little noise from the hall. As I said the rooms are quiet.3. Dining Room off the lobby with a great breakfast (buffet or menu service). Huge choice of different morning foods, beautiful flowers and Harry Benson photos on the walls. 4. Bemelman’s Bar. This beautiful bar has a jazz pianist from 5:30 to 8:30 and a jazz combo from 9:00 until. Full of interesting people, great music, great energy. 5. Café Carlyle. This is a supper club that seats less than 90 people and has a changing singer generally for a two week period. It is intimate and usually full. 6. Good value. If you want a hotel on the Upper East Side the Carlyle is right in the middle of the price range. This is not for the bargain traveler.7. If the weather is bad you just don’t have to go anywhere. With Bemelman’s and the dining room you don’t have to go out. 8. There are other great restaurants within a short block and dozens of great restaurants within a very short distance.9. One block from the Met Breuer and a short walk to the Metropolitan Museum and Central Park.10. Service, Service, Service. The staff is attentive, warm, and helpful. 11. Most excellent drug store (Zitomer) directly across the street for those things you forgot to pack.12. History.

The smell worsened the next few days. Each day we would complain and more freshning scents would be applied to the carpet. We then spoke with the manager who was aware of the issue but didn’t clarify exactly what the problem was. It was was evident that work being carried out, but why would establishment like this, selling a high end room be satisfied allowing a guest to stay under these circumstances with the scent seeping into the hallway of the room.Room was great - but for this price a shower in addition to a bath would be expected.Staff at reception were not as polished as usual.Great members of the team were Concierge - Stephanie and Waldo - thank you, Restaurants Gogo was fantastic, Eduardo made breakfast special, and so did Mizanur thank you Elevator gents - Sal, Adolfo, Frank, thank you - Doormen were fabulous as always","Geneva, Switzerland","Ayangara</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",54,3.0

I have been coming to this hotel since I was a little girl and I have a lot of memories built around the Restaurant, Bemelman's Bar, and the hotel itself. As mentioned many times in the posts, it is the hotel that hosted President Kennedy, British Royalty and, on my most recent stay, Roger Federer.We live close by and needed a place to stay for a few nights while our floors were being refinished. We booked a lovely deluxe suite and we were very happy with the spacious accommodations. The front office allotted us a large suite with an entry, a large powder room, a living room with a Steinway grand piano (which I actually enjoyed playing...very softly), a large spacious bedroom and a small master bath. On a high floor, facing south, we enjoyed sunlight all day long. The gentleman who checked us in was quite nice and friendly but I was surprised he didn't show us up to our room.In my view, one doesn't go to the Carlyle for sleek, large spa bathrooms or the greatest and latest in technology. Indeed, even the decor is somewhat beside the point. It's as if a rich aunt had a pied a terre in Manhattan and decorated it once with very nice furniture but never saw the need to bring it up to Architectural Digest standards. I personally love the hardwood floors beneath the large area rugs and the not necessarily perfectly matched furniture. I actually enjoyed the bathroom which I'm sure is not what you will find in the Four Seasons...it is like an old, apartment style bath...ours was mirrored but it was just the basics but I found the tub very relaxing and the whole thing had an unselfconscious charm.My problem with the Carlyle stems from the fact that this hotel needs to offer the type of world class service that really makes some physical quirks absolutely unimportant. When I think Mr. Federer chose to stay at the Carlyle as did the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge it is clear the Carlyle is absolutely able to offer an unsurpassed level of service. I like to compare the Carlyle to Claridge's in London. Another very particular style of hotel (but inarguably much more lovely) which will never need automatic drapery controls to exude elegance at every turn. At the Carlyle, though, I definitely get the sense that the level of service a guest receives is based on variables that should not exist in a world class hotel. The service was fine. I have no complaints...but it's not special. At no point was I ever made to feel special or valued which is what the Carlyle needs to offer to every guest. That's how other hotels surpass the Carlyle nowadays...not in glitz but in treating every guest like a VIP. I find, generally, that the top hotels in the US do not go out of their way to spoil their guests like their European counterparts. The Carlyle has an elegance that is unmistakable (and it's located in the best part of NY, without question, and it was meant to appeal, in the old days, to what was referred to as ""the carriage trade."") But guests like me don't get that really personalized service such as a bed made to a particular specification or even an additional bar of soap. The days of fruit plates or an evening amenity appear to,have disappeared entirely. The suite was large and very residential in feel. I was as comfortable as could be but I was not pampered. At all.Two other little things that I would like to mention: the elevator service really needs to improve. Don't get me wrong...I love the small elevators which are still operated by employees of the hotel. The problem is only two elevators out of four are running. This is a problem I had years ago. They are so slow and so small...and on top of that, sometimes the elevator operator leaves his post to help out elsewhere in the lobby. Other guests and I joked how they hotel should pass out a time table for the elevators...the wait can really cause one to be materially delayed. I am not exaggerating.Lastly, I was appalled by how far the hotel breakfast buffet has slipped over the years. For many years the Carlyle buffet breakfast was truly special. In fact, fifteen years ago you couldn't enter the dining room for breakfast unless dressed really properly. The buffet used to be a feast. The dining room is a gorgeous place. The breakfast has now been reduced to your basic chafing dishes with soggy hot food, some really nice fruit, yoghurts,a few healthy choices a bit of smoked salmon. If you closed your eyes you could be anywhere with chewy baguettes and truly pedestrian croissants. Just awful and much too awful for the Carlyle. . It is entirely self service...nobody will even carry your juice to the table or come around to pour water. It appears only guests ordering a la carte are entitled to any notice. A cold cup of cappuccino was plunked at my side. If this wasn't the Carlyle I suppose I would expect less but it is the Carlyle and all of us deserve to be greeted by name and we all deserve to be treated as special guests. No matter what, Bemelemens Bar is heaven. I will always go there for the best cocktails, specialty drinks and excellent food. I'm glad that's in my neighborhood.","New York City, New York","Alexandra M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",103,4.0

I found out about the funeral on a Tuesday and we had to be there Wednesday. Our daughter got the plane tickets and I took care of looking up hotels. I knew I wanted a good hotel near LaGuardia, and also a hotel that had airport transport. After much research I went ahead and called the Carlyle hotel. I had a computer screen in front of me with a quoted price in case I needed that information. I also knew I needed a crib for one room. The woman who answered the phone and then transferred me to reservations was very courteous and kind. The woman I spoke to in reservations was also very kind, patient and helpful. She matched the price I had onscreen, and also made certain everything I needed would be provided. She took all the airline information and had the Concierge arrange for the airport pickup, with an infant car seat in the vehicle. The hotel called me back with all the information I needed for the airport pickup, and confirmed a baby car seat. As we were landing at midnight knowing we had reliable arranged pickup was a great feeling. After we got to the hotel our check in was smooth, and we felt we were treated as important hotel guests. By this time it was close to 1:00 am, and so to be treated so nicely and helpfully truly felt good. Our rooms were very nice, the bed very comfortable, and the crib was already in our daughter's room along with a lovely little goodie bag for our grandson. This included a cute little teddy bear! We did have free wifi, but were far too tired to use it. Our wake up call the next morning was an actual person who was very nice and made it a personable call and not a robo kind of call. After enjoying the complimentary coffee in the lobby, we checked out, and again, all very smooth and personable. I have the utmost praise for the Front Desk staff at the Carlyle and the Concierge who arranged our airport pickup and called me with all the information I needed. We only needed the one night at the hotel, but I would certainly stay there again in an instant because of the high customer care we received.","Cumming, Georgia","Wen2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cumming, Georgia</strong>",46,5.0

When we arrived and shown to our room, we discovered it had a view over an internal site which was a builder's dump site. We asked to change to another suite and had to wait quite a while before we were taken to one that was barely better. It was very shabby: the chest of drawers in the bedroom had two handles missing (see pic); the upholstery in the sitting room was dirty (see pic); and outside our door in the the passage was evidence of building works with temporary paneling and uncovered life bulb (see pic). Furthermore the kitchenette had no kettle, no crockery, no tea, coffee or milk. I called housekeeping and when we returned to our room we discovered that only a kettle had been delivered. When we called to complain we were told that housekeeping only provides the kettle and that if we want the rest we needed to call room service. The room also did not have an iron or ironing board which again we had to have delivered. The breakfast service was inattentive and poor and the only time we got attention was when it came to the tab. The buffet breakfast was expensive and as I ordered poached eggs instead of the scrambled eggs which was all the buffet had on offer, I was charged extra on top of the buffet cost. When the additional cost of 3 cuppacinos was included, the total for two with gratuity came to c. $120 - for a mediocre breakfast with poor service! When I left the breakfast reatuarant on morning, the waiter followed me into the lobby to say I had not included a gratuity. The reality was that I had added a percentage to the total for the gratuity but had not allocated the gratuity between the waiter and the maitre d'hotel - basically as I am not familiar with allocating between two catogories of gratuity, especially when there was no service whatsoever from the maitre d'hotel. When I pointed out the gratuity had been added to the total, the waiter turned off and walked away without apologising. Finally, when we checked out at the end of our stay, there was a woman in front of us complaining about the state of her room and the poor service she had experienced. I could not resist telling her of our similar experiences, to which the check-out woman at the front desk said she would report our dissatisfaction to the hotel manager who would contact us directly. Needless to say, we never heard a word from the manager or anyone else from the Carlyle. In summary, this is the worst 5 star hotel experience we have ever experienced and frankly the Carlyle does not warrant a 5 star rating.

Our room, however, was tired and badly in need of refurbishment. The parquet floor near the front door was chipped and squeaky. Closet doors didn't close properly. The upholstered furniture had a musty smell. Hot water took a very long time to reach the shower, and the hallway had loose wires from ongoing renovation. Those issues were largely cosmetic. The bathroom was lovely--but the marble floor was very slick and the throw rug had no backing. That made it extremely slippery and very dangerous. Even with great care, it was hard not to slide across the floor with every step. We finally decided that the only safe thing to do was to pick up the rug and the bath mat. This is a serious accident waiting to happen. The bathroom urgently needs a non-slip rug.The hotel is charming and the staff was wonderful.

They immediately bought postcards and mailed them to Grampa via this mail chute- one child waited in the lobby while the other dropped the postcard from several stories up.They have a private car service, which is nice if you need it. Great location near the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park. The elevator operators (another odd anachronism) put me off at first, but they were very pleasant and professional and gave me a sense of added hotel security. A couple minor things: I was not pleased that the turn down service did not clean up the crumbs from all the nice cookies they gave us.

We booked thru Amex/Leading Hotels so were hopeful for an upgrade. Another perk of the program is potential early check-in, if available. We checked in around 2:30pm and were told our room was not ready but we could be upgraded to a suite after it had been cleaned. The front desk said they would call us to let us know when our room was ready. At 4:30p we still had not heard from the hotel so we went back and found out our room had been ready for about an hour. We tried to not be annoyed since they had upgraded us so we didn't complain and headed to our suite. Our suite, while quite large (full living room, full bedroom, 1.5 baths) looked like it had been last renovated in about 1988. The room was sparsely decorated which wouldn't have bothered me except for it was also incredibly worn. Furniture all chipped, painting had a hole in it, baseboards in need of painting. Our bathroom light switch had dried caulk running out of it. It was nice to have a large room but our suite needed some serious help. I could also hear every foot step of the person in the room above me. Another construction note - there are 4 tiny elevators and 2 of them were under construction during our stay. We had to wait for about 5 loads of people to go up before we could get to our room on Saturday night. I also had some problems with service. In addition to no one letting us know our room was ready, I tried calling the spa a couple of times and no one answered. We had to try the front desk and then they told us someone from the spa would call us back. Is that a huge deal? Not really, but combined with the state of our room, the elevator situation, the lack of letting us know our room was ready, it was just all a bit too much for the price of the room. I tried really hard to love The Carlyle but I just found it disappointing after hearing so many lovely things about it. The place needs an overhaul.I will note that Bemelman's Bar is a wonderful, neat place - my husband and I loved it!

We continually to choose the Carlyle because of it's staff and location. Having said that, my only consistent complaint has been that the front desk staff, one of your first impressions when you enter the hotel, can be very aloof and cold. I never receive a smile, 'welcome back', complimentary room upgrade, etc...As of July 2017, I will have stayed at this hotel four times in one year. While not a lot, a chain like the Peninsula notes and acknowledges a return guest with a smile, an upgrade, a note and usually something sent to the room. After our visit in April, the front desk manager reached out to me via email regarding a room issue. I took that opportunity to discuss my front desk observations, and the response was nothing but immediate, professional, gracious and appreciative. Lorena O., the Assistant Front Desk Manager, was thoughtful and thorough with her response. That's the Carlyle. That's why I will always return.From the moment you are greeted at the front door, as you pass Waldo and Stephanie at the Concierge Desk (and the other two wonderful gentlemen whose names I am blanking on), say hello to the attendants in the lobby and pop into the elevator, you are transformed into a completely different world. The Carlyle is quiet, discreet, and professional. The room service and room attendants are warm, efficient, and go above and beyond their duties to assist you. In February, my young daughter was ill and in the middle of the night someone was immediately in the room assisting us. In April, Jose, a room attendant, brought something to the room that he had also dropped off during July visit. These people are the face of this hotel.Waldo Hernandez, head Concierge, is the Carlyle. He has the best recommendations from services to restaurants. He has helped us obtain the most difficult of reservations and has been patient when our plans have changed last minute. Everyone on his staff is warm, funny and honest and helpful. They do not recommend restaurants because they have a special relationship with management and they are aways the first to inquire about a location that may be new to them. The room service and restaurants are beyond excellent and Bemelman's cozy and intimate (although it can get very crowded during the holidays). The recently renovated hotel rooms are spacious and elegant and always have one or two large closets. The bathrooms are on the smaller side (it's an older hotel) but include everything you need from bathrobes, to products, to an abundance of towels. Side note, the shower caps are the best in the world. If you get a room with a small kitchenette it can be very useful if traveling with teenagers or younger children...If you are looking for the latest, flashiest and/or most modern property in NYC, this is not where you want to stay. You stay at the Carlyle because of the staff and the location.

It is also an easy trip to Fifth Avenue, and many of the museums on the upper east side including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Met Breuer, the Guggenheim and many others. Plus, the neighborhood is quiet at night so you are not disturbed by rowdy tourists.My only caution is that it is an old-fashioned hotel. The rooms are beautiful, but traditional. You will not find the modern aesthetic common in many upscale hotels. That was perfect for us, but it may not be to others' taste.I highly recommend the Carlyle.","New York City, New York","AmyTRS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",52,5.0

I have loved it since I first stayed there over twelve years ago. They have been a top notch hotel since the Hoover administration and the ghosts that walk the halls and hang on the walls as photos are some of the greats of the 20th century- as an example, when I checked in this last time, one of the front desk clerks was on the phone talking about the ""Jackie Kennedy Suite"". Which is cute, until you realize, no, that was actually the suite Jackie Kennedy would stay in at the hotel.The staff is unfailingly courteous and professional, the rooms spotless, the beds insanely comfortable and it generally takes to the count of five to get hot water in the shower with brilliant water pressure. The food, while not exactly cutting edge, is delicious and the cabaret world class. But it does cater to an older, well-heeled crowd, so if you are looking for downtown excitement, this is not the place to stay. So, why not five stars? Because, as has been noted by others, the Carlyle needs some upgrading. It just seems a little...tired in some places and shabbily genteel in others. I just kept asking myself, don't the Rosewood people want to put money into this world class property to make it look as good as the people who work there make it run? The bones of the Carlyle are still brilliant, but it could do with some discreet cosmetic surgery.","Portland, Oregon, United States","Chris G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon, United States</strong>",17,4.0

The suite itself was very spacious and the two bathrooms were modern and clean. This particular suite had a bad view (darkened brick courtyard), but we really didn't mind. However, if a view is important to you, perhaps inquire at front desk before going to your room; other suites may have better views. High tea/lunch was lovely, as was the breakfast (the breakfast buffet for $39 was lovely and reasonably priced considering what it includes).

The wedding was very close by at the Central Park Boathouse (so no part of it was held at the Carlyle). We live in NYC but wanted to stay closer. This is a great hotel (and well located for this purpose) where I would stay again, but the experience was kind of mixed, so I'll try to be balanced here.Good: The hotel is clearly an iconic place, and our two room suite was very beautiful. I still think this is a great hotel and classic place to stay with nice rooms. We brought back ~30 people after the wedding to hang out in our siting room for a bit and it worked really well. We took some photos in the lobby and they also came out really well. The staff was very welcoming on the day of the wedding and service was great- they decorated the room with roses and left a gift of chocolates and a hand written note. We very much appreciated it. Also a good location and helps avoid midtown.For improvement: It was kind of a challenge leading up to the wedding and I almost pulled the plug on staying there. They originally said they could let us know if early check in was possible early the week of the event and said it was likely, but no one would give me a yes/no answer when we finally did ask (which therefore means, don't plan on early check-in). I ended up buying the night before (another $900) so I could guarantee we'd have access to the room by noon (rather than 3pm) the day of the wedding. Clearly one was available the night before. When I booked the original room, they also said we'd be welcome to take some photos in the hotel (just had to confirm closer to the date) but the person I spoke to the week of the wedding was more stand off-ish about the prospect. We ended up doing a few photos there anyway and it wasn't an issue. We tried not to be too disruptive, so I'm grateful we were able to do so. Also 6 large bottles of water delivered to your room costs $120, for reference.I understand the hotel's perspective behind the above issues but my main concern is that I got different answers to my questions over time from different staff members. It seemed like they'd be happy to accommodate our two main requests early on when we booked but that wasn't the case much closer to the event. We ended up having a great stay (albeit at twice the price I planned), the photos worked out well, staff was welcoming and accomodative when we were there, but I also realized you're not going to get too much special treatment at an important, busy New York hotel around the holidays (admittedly in this case, one that was not hosting other things associated with our wedding). Knowing this from the start probably would have helped us plan better.","Boston, Massachusetts","Brian1420</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",39,3.0

To say it's dated is an understatement. Only 2 of the lifts work, the suite we had booked was dated, chipped, worn and the furnishings 30+ years out of style. There were threadbare rugs and splintered furniture. The kitchenette was ancient and completely unstocked with basics such as cutlery. The master bath was small (there was a guest half bath) and had a single sink which was completely inadequate for a couple staying in the suite. The grouting around the bath and walk in shower was dirty and in desperate need of redoing. The pillows were awful - lumpy rubber filled and not even a comforter on the bed just a sheet, bedspread and blanket that we retrieved from the closet. The staff are all long term and so lovely and friendly. They are obviously popular with returning guests who seemed to mostly be in their 70/80s. Perhaps they enjoy the old-style rooms but I have to say I expect a lot more from a 5* hotel in NYC. Air conditioning 30-40 years old and noisy as hell to the point it woke us when it kicked in. Our room on the 8th floor looked out over the front of the building - the opposite building is undergoing renovation so our view was of scaffolding and tarpaulins. Not great. A fellow guest told us that rooms in the tower had been renovated but I cannot confirm this.We won't return sadly until the whole place has had a major facelift and I don't think there are any plans for this in the near future.

I am a New Yorker, living in Hong Kong and I was really looking forward to my third stay (in the past under my husband's name) at the iconic hotel. My first night, I took my close friend to Bemelmans Bar, not for the music (as we had a lot to catch up on), but for the atmosphere, which I have always loved. To celebrate being back in my hometown, I ordered a bottle of champagne and three plates of food. The staff was very nice (as they generally were throughout my stay). I was told that the dim sum would take a while, but I assured them that that was fine as we were there for the long-haul. About 15 minutes after placing our order, at 8:45 pm, the maitre d' (I assume) came by to inform us that we would have to pay the cover charges ($50 for the two of us) or leave by 9:00 when a trio was apparently scheduled to play. It was a Monday night, and no one had mentioned this to us before we sat down or ordered (in fact, he placed an announcement card on the table only when he approached us). I explained the situation, but he dismissively said he could extend until 9:15, but ""that's all [he] could do."" I told him that I was staying in the hotel, so he took my name and left. The people (also guests of the hotel) sitting at the table next to us, leaned over to say that it was an outrageous situation and that we should hold our ground. Later, the man returned to say, as though he were doing us a favor, that we could stay since I was ""a guest of the hotel."" What should have been a perfect evening was seriously undermined by his behavior, which was also needlessly brusque. We weren't finished with our meal until 10:30 that evening, and the bill came to $300 (!), so I'm not sure what they would have done with us if I hadn't been a guest of the hotel and instead ""merely"" a local patron of the bar (which I have been a number of times in the past). When I explained the situation the next day to a manager (Sofia, I believe), she was apologetic and said she would talk to the maitre d'. Unfortunately--though I just wanted to enjoy the holiday and not have to complain--I had to talk to her again about the early morning, hours-long drilling in the room directly next to mine. It was scheduled work she told me, and the hotel wasn't at full capacity (as she admitted), so I wondered why the hotel would have put me in that room (which was quite charming and comfortable, I will say, in other respects). She did not have an answer. I spent three nights at the Carlyle, and each day, I thought I would receive a note or some follow up, but nothing came.

Not just for its storied history, but because the bones of the place are phenomenal. Elegant understated design, gorgeous interiors in the common rooms and a culture of great service. As a frequent business traveler (often at the higher end hotels), I have in recent years been disappointed by visits to the Carlyle that should have been wonderful. Not wanting to go on and on, I will point out some highlights (lowlights?). The rooms are lovely but long overdue for renovation. The property was sold about three years ago and a complete room renovation was announced. Never happened. The buffet breakfast (and of course the Cafe Carlye bar/cabaret) are exceptional. However, regular meals here (restaurant or room service) are decidedly below average. This is unacceptable for a ""five star"" hotel with top-tier food prices. Even a basic burger or salad is notably not as good as the diner a block down on madison avenue (also pricey, but at least good). Another example is the gym. It's small and functional, which would be fine...if it were functional. Of the two ellipticals in the gym, today one was out of service and the reception on the TV on the other was all snowy. (The TVs on the machines never have good reception, even though they are cable). The gym had no towels (which is usually does, and the spa attendant said they low on towels today. Another guest who arrived as I was leaving looked at the empty shelf and said ""Again no towels?"" Lastly, while I use the business center in a hotel only occasionally for internet or printing, the Carlyle eliminated theirs recently and installed what appears to be a small retail space instead. I understand maximizing revenue and keeping costs down--and I also realize that in other contexts than Tripadvisor complaining about no towels, sub-par food and bad TV reception may seem whiny--but when paying top-dollar in NYC for a five-star experience, it is disheartening that the management of this great institution (and The Carlyle IS an institution) seems to be taking its reputation and its customers for granted. The staff are wonderful and seems eager to please...I just hope that management can summon the resources to keep the hotel up to par and improve those areas where they are clearly cutting corners.",New York,"DrewFromNY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",8,3.0

This year's stay was better by half a star. A few niggles prevented a full five star rating, but the hotel is still quite lovely and I would gladly return.Last year's stay was probably predestined to not be excellent. I booked through a ""secret hotel"" online flash sale, which was for a Superior room, the hotel's lowest category, and I of course was given a room on the lowest possible floor (3rd floor). This year, I booked directly on Rosewood's website, using the hotel's complimentary 3rd night offer. I selected the next room category up from Superior, which was a Superior Tower Room. These rooms are on the petite side with a queen bed in about 300 sq. ft., but are on floors 23-33 with Manhattan skyline views. I requested a higher floor.Because I booked through Rosewood directly, the hotel reached out to me prior to my stay. I hoped for a super early check-in (I took a red-eye flight), and the hotel was able to arrange that (kudos to Jamie Lee!), although my assigned room was lowered from floor 33 to floor 23. Check-in was fine with the doorman, bellman, receptionist and elevator attendant all offering cheerful assistance. A shower was most welcome after my flight into Newark :( and my budget-minded shlep on NJ Transit to Penn Station :( and then 2 MTA subway lines to the hotel.The room, as expected, was petite, but I was gifted with a lovely enclosed terrace that very few rooms have (thanks again Jamie Lee!), affording 180-degree Manhattan views east, south and west, thus getting a peek at Central Park. One of the terrace windows opened. Even on floor 23 I was still higher that most of the surrounding buildings, including lots of luxe residences on Park Ave. and Fifth Ave. It was fun to get a glimpse of the roof-top terraces on these buildings, including the Surrey Hotel across the street. The Tower part of the hotel is narrower than the base; my floor only had about 5 rooms. The largest was a private apartment that seemed to have at least 2 enclosed terraces and primo Central Park western and northern views. I was hoping to run into these privileged residents but never did.The room was decorated in a classic style befitting a classic hotel (opened in 1930). Furnishings looked weathered (intentional?) and somewhat cheap, especially the cabinets in the bathroom. The bathroom was very small, identical to last year's, but well-stocked with Kiehl's products. The HD TV was fabulous with an infinite number of channels and superb clarity. A big plus: WiFi is now FREE! Last year, guests had to pay, so I often used the Business Centre. For now, the Business Centre is closed, but hopefully the free WiFi will remain once it reopens. A big annoyance: water condensation from the A/C would loudly drip onto the terrace glass roof in a manner that was too inconsistent to be white noise.Niggles: the Business Centre was closed, as mentioned. Supposedly it will be relocated eventually. For now, guests needing a desktop computer can use one in a non-public area off the front desk. I went to what used to be the Concierge desk, only to find a wall. The Concierge is now at the bottom of the staircase by the Carlyle Restaurant entrance. I miss the rack of newspapers, magazines and tourist literature. The elevators, which have attendants, are slow. Although there are 4 elevators, only 2 seemed to be in operation, and only one of these accessed the tower, the other elevator stopped at floor 17. Waits from your floor can be particularly long; there was a posted sign to call if your wait has been too long. What's more, one elevator I was in stopped at the 6th floor and then refused to budge. Luckily the door opened, so the attendant had to call for the other elevator to come get us. Later that day, the elevator was still being serviced, so someone in the lobby had to call for the service elevator to take me to my floor. Luckily, I didn't have to go out that evening, or I would have had to add an extra 30 min. travel time.I did not partake of any of the hotel's offerings this stay, although I had intended to visit the famous Bemelmans Bar and have breakfast at the restaurant like last year. Cafe Carlyle is closed in the summer. I did visit the Met, Met Breuer and Guggenheim as well as Central Park and shops on Madison Ave., all of which are convenient to the hotel. Once in the elevator I bumped into a top-50 tennis player in town for the US Open. Had I bumped into my favourite male tennis player of all time--who regularly stays at the Carlyle while in NY (according to US Weekly magazine and confirmed by an anonymous Carlyle staffer), who is out for the rest of the year due to injury but came into town for sponsorship obligations--that might have warranted the last half star.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,4.0

We did not visit the hotel restaurants but ordered room service every day which arrived in a timely manner and was delicious. We would definitely recommend this hotel to families looking for a quiet area of New York but within easy subway or Uber distance to all the attractions. The only downside was that the bathroom in the master was a little awkward with a small deep bath that doubled as a shower and felt a bit claustrophobic.

Those are dated, but spacious. On my last visit, I was given an ordinary room. It was clearly a maid's room, left over from the days when the wealthy traveled with a retinue of servants. The tiny room with two twin beds was next to the service elevator, and the sound of room service carts being delivered started at 6:00 am and continued until I left the room at 8:30 am. The decor was from 1940, and not in a good way: painted (chipping) French Provincial furniture and a tiny partially tiled bathroom. I complained, and was moved to a like room on a different floor, though further from service elevator.

Gracious, knowledgeable, desirous to make your stay a good experience. Unfortunately, the hotel building does not live up to that standard. Perhaps it's the age of the structure, but there were problems in both rooms I stayed in. The first room, on the 11th floor was a bit worn - rug had a few ""spots"", the exposed hardwood floors were badly scuffed and several pieces of furniture were chipped. I assume this is one of the rooms that will be renovated soon. I decided to define the room as ""shabby chic"" rather than worn out. There were no blinds - just sheers and a set of drapes that would not stay closed.The big problem with the room, however, was that it was adjoining two other rooms. Where a door would have been, there was a (thin) plank of wood. I heard every word of every conversation in both rooms. When a cellphone rang in the room to my right, I reached for my own phone, it was that clear and loud. This went on for several hours until i went back to the front desk and asked if they had any other rooms available. The woman at the desk could not have been more sympathetic or helpful. As I was on my way out to dinner, she said, ""Go and have a wonderful time. Don't worry about a thing. We will pack you up and move you to a better room. Just come back here when you return and we'll take you to your new room."" The new room was on the 19th floor. ""Newer"" decor and had TWO sets of blinds on each window and a fruit and nut tray on the table. Quite nice, although the hot water faucet handle came off in my hand and the TV remote did not work and had to be replaced. HOWEVER....there was an adjoining room next door. Once again, the sound traveled so well that I could hear the man next door zip and unzip his suitcase. I enjoyed their discussion about the merits of the show they had seen. Every word of it. Since he and his wife didn't get to bed until 1:00am I purposefully avoided turning on the TV the next morning, knowing that I would have disturbed them. We met at the elevator later that day and they did mention that they heard my hairdryer loud and clear. Thankfully, everyone was good sports about the noise. Would I stay there again? Only if I could be guaranteed a room that did not join another - much less two others. Top of the line amenities are nice, but sleep is essential.","Silver Spring, Maryland","Phyllis O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",3,3.0

We have stayed in many fine hotels in the city- 4Seasons and St Regis etcAs we get a bit older and the city seeming more unsecure, an upper east side stay was a good decision for us. We booked connecting rooms, had to ask but we're grated a high enough floor to enjoy city views and a peak of the park.We were worried that the rooms would be typically city small but found the space very adequate for a one night stay. Renovated bathrooms , wood floors and walk in closets all things we like.We tend to enjoy smaller old school places to stay and the Carlyle was perfect. What set it apart is the service-from the moment you arrive and are greeted , to the elevator attendants you could want for nothing. But when you want something it was never an issue.Bemelmans for pre show light dinner and drinks and again for dessert and night caps was perfect. The breakfast sensational and again the service beyond reproach. We would put the service on par or perhaps better then many of the 4Seasons we have stayed. And this for us is the benchmark for quality service.The concierge recommended and arranged a great neighborhood Italian restaurant for dinner the night of our departure , the front desk allowed a very late check out-much appreciAted to freshen up after a long day at the met/shopping. Happily held our bags for a quick return pick up on our way to the train and home.Short but lovely stay. A real feeling of security when you stay and again outstanding service.

As always the hotel saff was superb. The doorman Emilio gave me a super warm greeting upon arrival. ""Hi Mr. Bick, welcome back"". Team members like Emilio make guests of the Carlyle feel special. When I got to the front desk I was lucky enough to be greeted by Sonal Nayyar from guest relations. Sonal is always so personable and takes the time to get to know clients of the Carlyle. This attention to detail makes guests of the hotel feel valued.On this stay I was lucky enough to have room 1515. Room 1515 is a newly renovated deluxe king room. In addition to beautiful décor and lighting room 1515 has a fantastic bathroom with a separate soaking tub and rain shower. Definitely one of the nicest bathrooms I have seen in the hotel. The room also features a small private terrace which looks East with a city view. This is one of the things I love most about the Carlyle, you never know what kind of a room you are going to get. Although all of the rooms I have stayed in at the Carlyle have been beautiful, they all seem to have different characteristics and variety.

The reason for choosing this hotel was the location being near to the apartment of our friends.We booked a superior room for the 7 night duration on a room only basis.The entrance lobby to the hotel is small, quite elegant and I suppose would be termed as discrete. Our welcome on arriving, from the concierge and reception was warm and professional and we were quickly processed and shown to our room.The room was a good size with a partial view of Central Park, well furnished with a large comfortable double bed. The refrigerator for the mini bar was a little ancient and the bathroom was also showing signs of age but nothing unacceptable. So the facilities were overall ok to good.However, the general atmosphere of the hotel was, in our opinion slightly frigid and bordering on being false to the point of being made to feel uncomfortable. We had no desire to loiter/use the common areas. Maybe because the common areas are small and dark, they (to us) felt uninviting. The elevator operators were pleasant enough although not all were consistent in their attitude to guests and the front of house ‘greeters’ acted in a manner that I expect many would now consider embarrassing.We booked to eat in the restaurant the one free evening we had. The experience could only been described as average. Room excellent, table setting and linen excellent, food was not good, service was unnecessarily overbearing and unjustifiably overpriced. We booked at 2000, a perfectly reasonable time but immediately felt we were being rushed through our meal. There were several tables occupied but the restaurant was probably only 40% full. The most unforgivable and bizarre error was removing our wine glasses when there was still a half a bottle of wine remaining. The practice of keeping your wine bottle out of sight and away from the table is one I find unnecessary and very irritating. The only reason we discovered that the wine had not been finished was when another waiter came to table to fill our glasses only to discover they had been removed. This has never happened to us before and can only be judged as unprofessional.Overall the Hotel Carlyle is ok. If you are on business or have made this your hotel of choice over the years I am sure you see benefits in this hotel which were unable to appreciate. I can imagine to some people, the hotel is like a good quality comfortable ‘old shoe’ warm, familiar, with old fashioned traditions. However, I would throw the shoes away and buy another pair with the same craftsmanship but questioning the value of some of the old traditions.We very much enjoyed the location of the hotel and surrounding area but we would not choose to stay in the Hotel Carlyle again.","London, United Kingdom","Mike P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",42,3.0

The Carlyle is situated perfectly in the Upper East Side (UES) of NYC. It is so quiet in the UES compared to midtown and within walking distance to great museums and Central Park. We will always choose the UES when visiting NYC. Check-in was seamless with Alessandro. We booked through AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts and he described the amenities that came with the package. Sadly, there was no upgrade with this stay b/c they were fully booked (US Open). Before our arrival, we almost changed our reservation to a suite because The Carlyle was running a special on suites, but we liked the view that the Tower Room was going to provide so we left well enough alone. Our Tower Room had sweeping views of NYC and it was quite a sight at night. It was exactly the view we were looking for when booking this room. To our amazement the windows opened all the way. There were locks, but they were ineffective. We enjoyed a fall breeze in the room. It was beautiful, but I would have been a nervous wreck if we had children in the room. As previous posters have stated, both the room and bathroom were very small and a bit rundown. There was a tear/run in the carpet that ran the length of the room. Also, the bathroom's plumbing needed a tune up. The sink faucets leaked and the bath/shower were so slow to drain that while taking a shower you would have water fill up in the tub up to your knees. I couldn't wait to get back to our home steam shower to feel pampered again. Breakfast buffet was included in our rate and it was delicious. The staff was very kind and helpful. However, be prepared to pay $10 for a cappuccino that is not included in the Buffett. An Italian dining next to me was given a check for his coffee and he gave it back to the waiter saying ""this is outrageous I just ordered cappuccino"". I think they comped the charge. We ate dinner one evening at The Carlyle's restaurant to celebrate our 10th anniversary. The food was good. The place was empty and that was disappointing. It lacked the ambiance of which I was hoping. Our server was strange. Our server sounds like the server described in the previous poster's review. When this ""captain"" asked us what kind of wine we wanted to order he made the comments as follows: ""I can tell which people have money. This one lady sat down and ordered a $200 bottle of wine and I was shocked I said, ""you go girl"""". It was instantly awkward. What was he saying? Did we not have money? Did the lady ordering the $200 bottle of wine not have money? Did he realize we were guests of The Carlyle? We got all dressed up for our special dinner. To ease the awkwardness we began to talk to him about our overseas travels to assure him we weren't just some random bums who just walked in off of the street. This dinner was the most disappointing part of our trip. There are too many restaurants in NYC and we won't be back to The Carlyle to dine for dinner. Also, one morning we ordered room service and the food was good, but the service wasn't up to par. The gentleman delivering our order got it wrong three times. He seemed visibly irritated which is unacceptable. Bemelman's was great! The David Budway Trio was outstanding. We would go back again when in NYC. Housekeeping was great! A kind housekeeper helped my husband and gave him a bandaid when he got a blister on the back of his ankle. She was heaven sent! Thanks a million!!! We enjoyed the elevator service. We didn't find that this service took too long. The men running the elevators were very informative, kind and helpful. Finally, we would like to thank the concierge who comped a bottle of Prosecco that I ordered when he learned it was our anniversary. He also sent up cheesecake. We so appreciated this kind gesture. All in all The Carlyle is beautiful and in the best location, but she is lacking in ways that if rectified can make this jewel sparkle again. I'm hoping that day isn't too far off.

My mother and I stayed there for a week on my first trip to New York in 1974. It is an elegant icon of the upper east side and a bye gone era. I saw Bobbie Short there several times. So when my wife and I decided to do an east coast tour for our 25th wedding anniversary, we splurged on the Carlyle for 2 nights rather than impose on friends. While it is still an icon, it is a bit long in the tooth and does not deliver the value one would expect for the price you pay. The lobby is still the same spectacular art deco place with shinny black marble floors. The front desk clerk was polite and checked us in efficiently. She explained all the extra benefits and amenities we were to receive for having booked through Amex Platinum Travel. This is a great deal if you have a Platinum Card. They give you an upgraded room (if available), free breakfast for 2 ($70), a $100 spa credit, one night’s cover charge waived at the Bemelmen’s Bar ($50) and 4pm checkout. However, the Spa was closed due to “unforeseen circumstances”. My mind is still running wild thinking what those might be. She told us that we were receiving an upgraded and recently renovated room. A charming bellman took us to our room. They still have elevator operators despite having automatic elevators. It is an elegant touch but it can make for a long wait in the morning.The RoomThe upgraded, recently renovated room turned out to be tiny, about 180 sq ft or 12 x 15’ exclusive of bathroom and closet. Dominated by a king bed, it also had a desk, bureau and chair. It was tight, cramped quarters and actually a challenge for 2 people to navigate.Within less than a minute after the bellman left, my wife discovered the sink had some small food particles stuck to it. Upon further inspection, we both notice that it was covered in soap scum. Additionally, the shower floor looked dirty especially around the edges. A maid showed up promptly and cleaned the sink and scrubbed the shower. It turned out that problem with the shower was a poor grouting job. Candidly, if a contractor tiled my shower in that fashion, I would ask him to redo it. The reason for the soap scum became apparent upon first use of the sink. It would not drain. We notified the front desk on our way to dinner and the problem was resolved by the time we returned.After this first experience, I could not help myself. I checked under the bureau and the floor of the closet. Both were very dusty. The Carlyle holds itself out to be a super luxury hotel and I hold it to that standard. What you would over look at a Best Western, is frankly inexcusable here. Someone needs to have a serious talk with housekeeping.One of the oddest things in the room was the light switching arrangement. One switch by the door controlled the overhead light, both bedside lights and a wall plug between the windows. The problem with this arrangement is that if you want to turn on the bedside lights, the bright overhead light has to be on. This means that you have to get out of bed to turn of the bedside and overhead lights. Oh, if you happened to be charging a phone or computer using the plugs, they go off as well when you kill the lights. What electrical genius thought that one up?Finally, the thermostat is a bit antiquated. You not only have to set the desired temp but you have to determine if you need AC or heat. So if you want the room at 70 and it’s 76, you need to be sure to flip it to AC. Otherwise you continue to bake. Once we were instructed on its use, the room temp was fine. The bed was very comfortable and they use great linens and towels. Also, the room was fairly quite. We could not hear any street noise. However, we could hear doors and even quite conversation in the halls. Thank heavens our neighbors were quite. Did I mention that we were paying $765 a night pretax for all this?BreakfastFrankly, the breakfast buffet is sublime and if we were paying for it, it would be worth the $35 cost. Great smoked salmon, cream cheese and bagels. This is the only buffet where the scrambled eggs were moist and perfectly done. Even the oatmeal was excellent, another rarity on a buffet. There were excellent fresh fruit and juices. The breads and muffins were top notch. The coffee was great. The service was, well, iconic. You know you are not in Kansas anymore. Bemelmen’s BarSimply wonderful! The jazz trio was superb; just a joy to listen to. Best of all, they played at perfect volume. You could have a conversation and hear the band. It was an elegant crowd with several beautifully dressed women. It is the quintessential hotel bar. Obviously, it is expensive but worth it.Café CarlyleThis is a great New York supper club and was home to Bobbie Short for about 30 years. It hosts some very talented, intimate acts. We saw John Pitzerelli, an amazing guitarist and his wife. She has a beautiful voice and together they make wonderful music. It was a charming show. The only gripe I have is that I think if you are staying at the hotel, you should be able to make a reservation at the bar (less expensive) as well as a table. If we don’t show, charge us. And did I mention that we were paying $765 a night? My charming wife was able to negotiate a table as the bar was full so it worked out. It was a wonderful way to spend our 25th. Again, it ain’t cheap. But if you have never been, go once. There is no place like it. ConclusionThe Carlyle is still an elegant New York icon and I am glad that we returned for our anniversary. It was very special. The Hotel sent is a small congratulatory cheese cake that was excellent. They also credited the $100 spa credit to our total bill as the spa was closed. But I have to say that the room was disappointing for the price and its condition was inexcusable. Did I tell you it was $765 a night? I suspect there are issues with the building that make renovations very challenging. It has to be over 75 years old. Nonetheless, I know there are other 5 star hotels in the area that are hundreds of dollars less expensive. It breaks my heart to do it but I rate the hotel 2 stars. I do this because, to me, there is no such thing as an average super luxury hotel. It either lives up to its billing or it’s below average. It is not on the same level as the Ritz Paris. I would not discourage someone from staying there but be forewarned some rooms do not deliver the value for which you will pay. I would not pay $765 for our room again. But it’s still an icon.","Bozeman, Montana","Bigal1953</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bozeman, Montana</strong>",65,2.0

But the way I was treated after my stay and then the insincere follow-up by management has been insulting At the outset, I will credit the hotel manager for refunding one night's stay for my nightmare of a visit. But beyond that, I have experienced nothing but feckless attempts to remediate what should never have happened. As a long-time patron of the Carlyle and as a very lucky traveller who has experienced memorable stays at five star hotels for over twenty years, I cannot believe this great hotel would be so cruel to a guest and lie about any attempt to rectify their disgrace.As a resident of Manhattan, I have always considered the Carlyle my go-to place for celebratory dinners in their beautiful restaurant and I've spent countless hours enjoy drinks and piano music in the Bemelman's Bar. Whenever a guest comes to New York or when I meet a friend for lunch, the Carlyle has always been my first choice. Thanksgivings, graduation lunches and even my husband's proposal of marriage were all at the Carlyle.Recently I had a huge flood in my apartment and needed to relocate. Or course, I booked a suite at the Carlyle and moved in for five or six nights as an immediate and temporary solution. While I residence, I planned a subsequen one-month stay to coincide with the extensive work needed in my apartment. During this five/six night stay, I experienced an number of minor disappointments such as the shoddy condition of the furnishings in the living room (where a desk drawer pull fell off I to my hands (for example) and the lack of amenities I typically receive at world-class hotels. We had no water one evening, the TVs didn't work because the hotel depends solely on local cable service, some of the towels were ragged, and so on. The size and layout of the suite was appealing and the bathroom was new despite no hot water. One evening my daughter, son and a friend went down to Bemelman's bar for drinks and some light refreshments. ( The bar offers some delicious food options as well as amazing cocktails. Furthermore, the different pianists who play are excellent and a pleasure to listen to). For no conceivable reason, other than my family not dressed as sleekly as some other guests, were singled out and treated in a deeply humiliating manner. The server, brimming with sanctimony and judgement, ignored my family in such an extreme way, it was almost comical if not so downright saddening and humiliating. You cannot imagine how much they were treated like unwanted dirt. I do not exaggerate. As a life-long New Yorker I Know a thing or two about mean and dismissive waiters who serve guests based upon their Louis Vuitton handbags and cashmere sweaters. It was not my [grown] children's imagination when they came back to,the suite with deep dejection apparent. I asked them what had happened and they told me about the poor service that indicated they were absolutely targeted by the waiter. In fact, once he learned they were in-house guests, the waiter was shocked and his attitude changed. The waiter judged my family based upon snobbery. By the way, no group should be sneered at, ever! When I reported this to management, I was scolded for suggesting our waiter mistreated my family. They indicated I had a prejudice against the waiter and was making baseless claims! I couldn't believe it! I was not looking to get the guy fired: I was just communicating humiliating and uncalled for treatment which, despite a large bill for drinks and food, had caused sadness. The managers determined I was to be labeled a trouble maker based solely upon the same waiter's own version of the truth Secondly, one morning when my son needed to leave at seven AM the door knob to our suite fell off. If I had not caught the door before it was closed, we would have been trapped. I called the front desk and they were dismayed. They said someone would be up immediately to repair it. After we had breakfast and we returned to our room, at about 8:45, no one had repaired it. A nasty, aggressive engineer told us it was not his job to repair the door: that task was the carpenter's job and he didn't start work until 9:00am. [I would also like to add, as an aside, each morning when we tried to leave at 7:00-7:30, the manned elevators did not respond to our call for the elevator. We had to call the front desk to ask them to send the elevator man to our floor. More than once we were told he couldn't respond immediately because he was getting a cab for another guest. Now, this isn't an Inn in a little town. This is a luxury hotel in a major city claiming to operate with full service 24 hours a day. This was another thing I didn't complain about.] when the world's nastiest and most aggressive unapologetic engineer told us, basically, too bad I don't fix doors, I lost my patience. However, after I complained, the manager told me I had accused the hotel of endangering my family and that the hotel created a liability. I never said such a thing. I was treated with a haughty attitude and was basically, once again, called a liar. After this debacle, and be use we had extended our stay for another night, my husband called to ask for a small and reasonable discount for our final night's stay. We had not received any apologies or ""bottles of champagne"" so my husband felt this would not have been treated as an outrageous request. Well, the manager basically called my husband greedy. I know what he was thinking, betraying a terrible prejudice based upon his false assumption. Nevertheless, I proceeded with my plan to stay at the Carlyle for my subsequent month-long stay (which would have created revenue of $1500 per night.) one might ask why? Well, the Carlyle is still the Carlyle and after years of fun and festive occasions, including having used their event space for a number of catered luncheons, we just chalked it up to a horrible one-off. Plus it is utterly conveniently located, close to my apartment.On the Sunday night, two nights prior to our check-in date, I received a call at home from an irate manager from the Carlyle. He said ""due to your complaints, you are not welcome at the Carlyle and we will not honor your reservation."" I was shocked. The manager berated me and refused to listen to anything I had to say. He acted as if I had behaved in a materially offensive way or had destroyed property or had made any sort of a scene at the reception or in the lobby. I made a one or two agitated phone calls out of frustration and disbelief but my claims were valid, they were handled inappropriately and I was out of patience.. My reaction was never over the top and I never treated anyone on the hotel staff as remotely poorly as the waiter had treated my family. The manager accused me of berating his front office staff. This is not true. Now this manager was berating me in the most base fashion until I was I tears. I now was left stranded for a month' sl long stay. I had to evacuate my home within two days and now I had no place to stay. I was told I was ""banned for life"" from the Carlyle. He called me some sort of racist (which was absurd, an insult and a lie...especially since I, myself, have experienced discrimination and ignorance.) i told him he was absolutely incorrect and I had not even encountered any opportunity by which such a remark could have even entertained. I had made my reservation through Platinum Amex. He further insulted me by telling me if I didn't cancel through Amex, he would charge me as a no-show even though he was the one cancelling our reservation. And to top it all off, he told me he was calling Platinum Amex to ""tell on"" me. When I asked him, as a gentlemen, to refrain from adding to my embarrassment by refraining from making such a call, he told me it was his right to do so and he would.Well, not long after my stay a manger did contact me by email. After a few email exchanges, when he did keep his word and refund us for one might of our stay, he dropped the matter: you see, he offered to speak with me on the telephone to get the details. After what used to be referred to as telephone tag, he never did. I called his office, as instructed, but he was never available. Then I would receive another email asking me for my availability and then he never called.

I missed my chance to take my daughter and her new husband to Bemelman's for champagne while listening to the piano (I myself am a pianist myself and especially enjoy these first rate performers) I will never understand why a polite, dignified, well-traveled, educated woman was disgraced by a man who twisted everything that happened to,his own purposes.","New York City, New York","Alexandra M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",103,1.0

Roger Federer has a suite named after him (and stays here), Woody Allen comes to play the piano Monday nights, but most celebrities, indeed most of the clientele you'll encounter at the Carlisle are likely to be elderly. The downstairs piano bar and jazz lounge are intimate and lively, in an understated way. You will encounter guests with dogs which is not for everyone - they let canines stay in all rooms. Location one block back from Central Park is terrific (Museums and Madison Ave), however you'll be very lucky to get a spectacular view from your room as the vast majority of this hotel's rooms are below the top of the buildings on the opposite side of the street: rooms with 'good' views start at $1,300 a night according to front desk. Service: no complaints about front desk, bell desk (energetic) and concierge (efficient). Restaurant staff however on more than one occasion got too pushy about the gratuity part of the breakfast bill where there is not just a gratuity line for the server but also one for the captain.The hotel has some limousines which will take you as far as 57th street for free (gratuity expected for the driver of course), but sadly one of these drivers spoiled the hotel's reputation by making us feel we really, really needed to look after him if he was to oblige by taking us a few streets further than 57th Street, but he was adamant he would not come off Madison Ave, so he was knowingly going to leave us 5 Avenues from where we needed to be, high heels etc. The look of disgust on his face when we asked him just 5 blocks from the hotel to stop so we could get in a taxi that had pulled up alongside us was unforgettable. We were helping him get back to serve other guests, and he still expected a tip when he had offered lousy service… welcome to NYC. But the main drawback is the elevator frequency. The hotel was running at 100% occupancy when we stayed, and the white-gloved elevator operators could simply not cope at peak times… nobody should have to wait between 3 and 7 minutes (no exaggeration) for an elevator in any 5star property. For this reason this hotel is no good for busy working professionals.",London,"awayweekender</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",86,3.0

It was the small touches, though, that impressed me the most. The large, walk-in closet; the Kiehls bathroom products; the thoughtful turndown service; the extra-plush slippers.Throughout my (short) stay I found the staff to be courteous and professional.The only criticism I have is that to charge $15/day for wifi in this day and age, particularly given that the room was close to $1000/night including taxes, is completely unacceptable. The rest of the experience was refined, and by contrast the pay-per-day internet system felt tacky and outdated. The Carlyle is not for budget-conscious travellers.

Oh dear, how it has changed. The first night our air con was faulty and made such a noise that we were unable to sleep at all. We reported it in the morning and were told that someone would look at it but no apology or other comment was given.After a long day out we returned to find our room had not been done, beds still unmade etc. We called housekeeping who came and then said they might as well do turn down to save them coming back and plunged the room into darkness.That was the last turndown we had in four days though the room was at least done in the morning on the other days. My husband had joined us from a business trip and given in some laundry - 2 days later there was still no sign and when it returned a pair of trousers were missing. Again no apology - just an insistence they were never sent even though there was a charge for them on the bill. They arrived the evening before we left with no explanation, refund or apology. The front desk staff were distinctly disinterested and we even witnessed one girl rolling her eyes to heaven after a complaint from a guest in front of us. Deeply unprofessional. The hotel was full of tennis players as it was during the US Open and the manager was certainly on hand to attend to them but not the other guests, many of whom were having similar experiences. On a plus point the restaurant was good, delicious brunch on Sunday in particular, but we were overcharged twice on our bill though this was rectified when pointed out. Porters were also extremely helpful and charming.All in all a sad demise of what used to be a grand hotel.

Since this was only a small part of an Identity Theft case I suffered last year, the case has been dragging since, and the CC company states that the Property considered the charge valid, since the card was swiped there.I was so frustrated with this been going on for a year, that about 2 months ago I took a trip to NY, to visit the hotel, and inquire about the investigation, this is one of the last debits I have yet not been reimbursed for.

The lobby is gorgeous, as is the Carlyle Restaurant, the Café Carlyle and Bemelmans Bar. The live music at Bemelmans is always superb and I regard Tim and his team as the best bartenders in NY.I have had the opportunity to stay in standard rooms as well as suites. In each case I have yet to find anything but beautifully decorated, spacious rooms, some with spectacular views of Manhattan or Central Park. The rooms are also kept extremely clean thanks to a first class housekeeping team. Another of the Carlyle's greatest strengths is it's superb staff. What makes the staff so special is that there is a consistency in the level of service provided across all members of the team. From the moment you pull into the Carlyle parking garage (which is located conveniently steps from the front entrance) you are treated with warmth and respect. The parking lot attendants are friendly and diligent.The doormen always have a smile or kind word. The front desk staff is top notch, Moamed, Larry, Marina and others always provide me with a warm greeting, ""Welcome back Mr. Bick"". The team at the front desk excels at making repeat clients feel special and welcome. They take their jobs seriously and make it a point to chat with me when I arrive, they make the experience personal for me and I appreciate it. Paul, who frequently helps me get my bags up to my room is great.The elevator operators are also always warm and courteous, they recognize the fact that I stay at the hotel frequently and always say ""welcome back""Patrick Sewell my ""Guest Relationship Manager"" is another standout. The fact that he makes it a point to greet me when I arrive and talk with me for a few minutes makes my experience at the Carlyle very special. Over the past eight months the fact that Patrick has taken the time to get to know me (and my family) has made me feel a sense of home when I am at the Carlyle. Patrick is a terrific people person who fosters loyalty amongst the Carlyle clients. When Patrick is not at the hotel I have had the pleasure of working with Sonal Nayyar. Sonal also excels at her job and is extremely friendly, polished and diligent.In summary, the Carlyle is a world class hotel with a world class team. They excel at making their client base feel special, they personalize the guest experience and reward loyalty. This is not true of so many hotels these days, that is what differentiates the Carlyle and makes it so special.","New York City, New York","Ross B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",10,5.0

Although we tend to stay at more modern or newly renovated hotels (Peninsula in Paris & Chicago, Hotel Arts in Barcelona, Mandarin Oriental in Boston and Vega), we were excited to experience the old school charm of the Carlyle.We arrived around 8:30am after a red-eye and the front desk informed us that some guests had checked out early and that they should be able to get us checked in as soon as housekeeping was through with them. Rather than change clothes and start touring the city, we decided to have breakfast close by (Sant Ambroeus) so that we could properly unpack and freshen up before heading out. After breakfast (maybe 10:30am), we came back to the Carlyle, and front desk advised us that they were still getting the rooms ready. So, we sat in the lobby, and caught up on emails, etc. At 11:30am, we checked again and received the same answer. So, we decided to get some fresh air and walked around the neighbourhood to check out a few of the fitness studios that we would be frequenting over the next few days. We came back at 1:30pm, and still the room wasn't ready. This was starting to get annoying. We had been walking around the heat of NYC in our jeans and jacket and used up half a day of our 5 day stay just hanging around. It would have been fine if front desk had told us that the room wouldn't have been ready until 3pm (normal check-in). Then, we would have changed into our shorts and headed to midtown or Soho and come back in the afternoon. But, the expectation was set up that it would be ready around 9ish or 10ish.We finally got checked in around 3pm. The room was OK, very well kept, but as expected, very old school. Probably due to the outstanding service we received at Peninsula Paris a few weeks ago, my wife has developed very high expectations when it comes to hotels, so she provided feedback to the front desk about our experience in the morning. We received an apology at that point, but that was about it.But, the next day, we received a nice gift (chocolate and a bottle of wine) and a written apology from Sonal (guest relations manager) in our room and that they would do whatever they could to make the rest of our stay enjoyable. Then, on day 2, they upgraded us to a bigger corner room with better views. We ran into Sonal at the spa, and she's got to be one of the most friendly and professional hotel managers we've come across (and that's a lot).So, although our stay started off with a bad taste in our mouth, the Carlyle went over and beyond our expectations to make amends. We were also very impressed with the Kiehls products in the rooms. We haven't been in the restaurant yet, but notice that it is quite busy, despite not having a lot of visibility from the street so I'm thinking it must be very good. Would definitely recommend the Carlyle to others, especially for the service.","Vancouver, Canada","Jager350</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",34,5.0

The service was good although at times it did feel as if three people were doing the job of one just to extract more tips from you.The lift men were a throw back to a different time, although a novelty, completely unnecessary.The room was certainly considerably bigger than I had expected, and had the feeling that it had been a studio apartment at one time. There was a small kitchenette (which was massively in need of modernisation), and a couple of walk in wardrobes. The bathroom was small (and mirrored on every wall which was a little strange), it was a shame that some of the space from the wasted walkin wardrobe hadn't been shared with the bathroom to make it more comfortable.I had concerns regarding how noisy the room would be as it had wooden floorboards and interconnecting door (my pet hate), it was however very quite.The house keeping was a little hit and miss and was obviously dependent on who was doing it.I guess it is typical of this type of hotel in NYC, but I did miss not having the usual coffee machine in the room for a cup of coffee first thing in the morning which in my experience is typical of the more business hotels in NYC.","Chester, United Kingdom","OnTravelsAgain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chester, United Kingdom</strong>",322,4.0

It had a single sink with a bidet right next to the tub/shower. I had to have my husband help me out of the shower because I couldn't get my foot over the tub without falling on the bidet. The tub was a jacuzzi style so the sides were higher. The furniture looked very worn, however, the bed was fairly comfortable. It was very clean and the maids were very friendly. In fact, all the staff were superior. The food was top notch as well. I can't imagine that Prince Wm and family stayed here. What must they have thought of NY? There must be some other better rooms.

We loved the appointments, the art, and the decor, all of which were a significant influence on our choice to stay here.The one blemish on this otherwise lovely experience, was the excessive mold in our shower and tub area. It was in the caulking around the shower door, as well as the tile grout in various places. I asked for this to be addressed at the front desk, and it was not. Perhaps the only opportunity to fix it was to put us in another room that was not available, but I still think more should have been done to address this situation-- since mold in a bathroom is below the dignity of a hotel of this caliber.We would certainly consider staying at the Carlyle again, but I would like to know that our experience with mold was just an unfortunate anomaly, coupled with an unfortunate oversight in addressing it for us.","Tacoma, Washington","Brad V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma, Washington</strong>",2,4.0

The view from our tower room was awesome—we could not stop looking or taking pictures. The bed was super comfy, linens are gorgeous, we were able to crank the A/C down appropriately. Loved the Kiehls products, the real shower cap, the great water pressure. (People seem to complain about the bathroom size at the Carlyle. Ours was small but the lovely towels, terrific water pressure and constantly replenished products more than made up for the space.) The gym is bright and very well equipped with weights exercise bands, magic circles, a rowing machine, etc. in addition to the usual hotel gym suspects. I had a fantastic massage in the spa by Claudia. We there through AmEx Platinum Fine Hotels & Resorts so were treated to the buffet breakfast—which was delicious and a quick option. (Gratuity is sometimes not included with the AmEx breakfast—it was here. We did not even have to sign a check...was very convenient.) We enjoyed Bemelman's Bar which I guess requires shoes on feet at all times. [I had kicked off black patent leather heel under the table and was asked to put it back on because there were ""people in the bar."" It was the oddest request ever...especially in light of the customer wearing sequin flip flops with her feet on a bar stool, which I find more offensive. But I digress.] The WiFi appeared to be on the fritz for most of our time there...came back online the day we were leaving. It is normally paid but free with the AmEx Platinum card plan.

The soundproofing of the aging windows is among the best I’ve experienced in a hotel.

From the sale's brief description, I guessed the hotel to be the Mark, but it turned out to be the Carlyle. The hotel has long been on my radar, but this was my first stay. The sale was for the hotel's cheapest, lowliest room, the Superior, so my opinions of the hotel are from this ""steerage class""vantage point--think of where Leonardo DiCaprio's room was in the movie ""Titanic"". Many presidents, royals, and celebrities stay here, including Mr. and Mrs. George Clooney very recently, but of course they reside in the luxury upper level suites. From my view, the hotel seems to be resting on past laurels.The 34-story hotel opened in 1930 and sits on the corner of 76th and Madison. The Surrey hotel, where I've stayed before, is across the street, with the Mark one block north. The Upper East Side is known for its old money residents in doormen-accessed buildings. There are permanent residents within the Carlyle building. For tourists, the main attractions are the Met and Guggenheim museums, Central Park, and high-end shopping on Madison Ave. Well regarded restaurants are not a strong point, nor is nightlife. The only subway is the local 6, which can be oppressively crowded.My initial impression of the hotel was not good, because there was no doorman to greet me. One finally appeared as I was dragging my luggage out of the taxi's trunk. From then on service was excellent. The doorman read my luggage tags and announced my name to the front desk, where check in was quick and friendly, even offering a beverage. There are four elevators, but they must be staffed by an attendant to function, so only 1 or 2 are in use. Many times, people were sitting on the lobby chairs and sofas waiting for an elevator. The elevator attendants were the only sour spot service-wise. They were for the most part unsmiling, which you would be too if you were stuck in a hot confined space all day in a hot uniform complete with white gloves. One attendant was constantly fanning himself.When booking, I had optimistically requested a higher floor room with an exterior view. While I got the exterior view of Madison Ave., I was assigned the absolute lowest floor that housed guest rooms, the 3rd floor. The spa, beauty salon and small fitness centre were also on this floor. My neighbours included a gentleman who I think was a hotel employee and a nanny in charge of an infant and an active toddler. I don't know where the parents were, probably on a higher floor. I was rather embarrassed to call out my lowly floor number whenever I used the elevator going up, and the looks of disgust from guests and the attendant for having to stop on my lowly floor when boarding the elevator going down caused me to take the stairs down after the first day. I would have taken the stairs up too, but they are locked between the 2nd and 3rd floors.My room, a Superior King, was a decent size, with lots of natural light pouring through the 2 windows overlooking Madison Ave. There were actually inner and outer windows, which provided good sound insulation--I only heard the occasional siren--better than at the Surrey. There was a vase of fresh rosebuds, the TV had lots of channels. the closet was walk-in and housed the safe and minibar within. Negatives: old style, old looking decor (like a guest bedroom at your grandma's house), a TINY bathroom with all its walls mirrored to try to make it look bigger, and the biggest faux pas--you have to PAY for Wifi. I paid for the first day, then used the Business Centre, which you have to walk through the Gallery dining area to get to.The hotel has 4 dining areas and lounges. The Carlyle restaurant serves all 3 meals, the Gallery serves afternoon tea plus food. Bemelmans Bar is famous for its murals and nightly jazz and seemed very popular for the UES upper class. Cafe Carlyle is famous for its cabaret dinner shows, but is closed in the summer. I only tried the Carlyle for breakfast and did their buffet, which was decent but not terribly extensive. Service was great, almost cloying, but things were not replenished quickly at the buffet. People watching was very amusing--lots of hoity-toity folks. I also had room service one night and it was fine. As stated before, well-regarded dining in the area is not a strong suit. Cafe Boulud in the Surrey is perhaps the best known local fine dining restaurant. I found the ""famous"" J. G. Melon restaurant unpleasant and overrated.I noticed taxis do not always queue at the hotel entrance on 76th--the doormen sometimes have to go to Madison to hail one. At check-out, I needed to get down to the Peninsula on 55th, so the doorman offered the use of the house car. The driver was efficient but unfriendly.Overall not a bad stay, but for me there are better choices in New York., such as the Peninsula. Past laurels only get you so far, at least in steerage class, and paying for Wifi is an abomination in this day and age.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,4.0

The room was enhanced by a large walk-in closet with plenty of hangers and room for luggage. Amenities included a well-stocked but expensive mini-bar (but no coffee equipment), Kiehl's toiletries, plush bathrobes and slippers, and our choice of newspaper delivered every day. The marble bathroom had a roomy bathtub plus an extra large shower with a hand-held shower head as well as a large overhead one. While serviceable, the room furniture was a bit on the shabby side (nicks, dings, flaking paint) and needed to be refreshed. The bar top marble needed its water rings removed. The murals,atmosphere, and drinks of Bemelman's Bar can't be beat (be aware of evening cover charges). We also enjoyed a delicious tea inThe Gallery, as well as breakfast and dinner in The Carlyle Room. All staff members make you feel welcomed, are helpful, and try to resolve issues that arise. We were pleased to avail ourselves of the house car service to take us to a dinner reservation in Midtown on Saturday night. Not many hotels have manned elevators any longer.There does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between the desire of staff to resolve issues and the ability to get things taken care of, i.e., a never remedied slow-draining bathroom sink. Similarly, there needs to be better communication between The Carlyle Room staff and its kitchen (and perhaps among the kitchen staff) to avoid long waits for dishes ordered from the breakfast menu plus a big lag time in refreshing the breakfast buffet of simple items such as bagels. Overall, our visit was a very pleasant and memorable one at this venerable Upper East Side landmark.","Alexandria, VA","Alexandria_VASusan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, VA</strong>",13,4.0

It was nice to be on the Upper East Side where it is calmer and it is an older, elegant hotel. The room was quite large with hardwood floors and a large closet. The bed was very comfortable with lovely linens and great pillows. Nevertheless, I think that in light of the competition in the high end hotel market in New York, there were a few things that should be addressed. The bathroom was tiny with no room to place your toiletries and the room had a shower/tub configuration and was bit tired. My rooms in the past at the Carlyle have had this tub/shower combo so I assume that all the rooms have this. If they decided to renovate and increase the bathroom size and upgrade it, there is plenty of room to do so. I definitely think this is something they should consider soon. In addition, there was a large, dark stain on the way of the hallway to my room. At these prices, I was quite surprised that this had not been addressed.

It was not the category I reserved and moreover could best be described as shabby chic with an emphasis on shabby! The bathroom was tiny with a shower/tub combination which I abhor. I called down to the front desk and the girl who answered the phone told me that this was in fact what Amex platinum had booked for me so I asked to speak to guest relations manager. He said he would look into it and call me back. In about 15 minutes he called back and said that Amex had made a mistake but in looking at our previous booking we had booked a higher category suite so he would upgrade us to one on this visit. If this had been the only glitch I would have overlooked it. The next day I was on the elevator with an elderly woman and another guest manager. She was complaining loudly about the unacceptable suite she had just been taken to and that it was not what she had booked. As we got off the elevator the guest manager turned and looked at me, rolled his eyes and shook his head. I was surprised by his lack of respect for this guest. The next morning I went to the dining room for breakfast and when I asked for a menu was told that I was Amex platinum and as such was to eat at the buffet. I responded that I was aware of my amex benefits but that I wanted to order from the menu. After 10 minutes , with no menu forthcoming I gave up and went to the buffet. With that you may wonder why I chose to book here again. Well we have been loyal customers for many years and have had many happy family visits here.We were already making memories with another generation with our 18 month old granddaughter so I wrote it off as an unfortunate visit with better hopes for next time. This week I got an email from the hotel welcoming for my upcoming visit and was shocked to see that I was again booked in a suite category that was not what I reserved. I immediately called room reservations and was told by the clerk that I had booked that suite. I am looking at my amex website with the confirmation for the higher level suite. She basically tells me that it isn't her problem and that if I wanted to change it I needed to call platinum services. I told her to cancel my reservation.For got to mention that on the April visit I was in fact not upgraded but on checkout charged the rate of the suite we wanted. After talking to platinum card services Steve stated that he would look into the situation and call me back. After looking into it he said there appeared to be alich between the Carlyes website and amex That had just happened to occur for my past two reservations.He stated that he was going to contact the hotel and that he would make sure my reservation was canceled for next week. He then booked me at the St. Regis where we have stayed in the past. I am very disappointed at the decline in service at this property but we won't be back again until improvements are made. This hotel could take some instructions in customer service from another Rosewood hotel, Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. We stay there monthly and it is nothing but perfection in every category.

According to one of the many splendid taxi drivers who whisked my sacred person about this truly great world city, 'Pope Francees, he stey khere!'. Now, as I am not of a left-footed persuasion, the visit of the Pontiff means little to me. Perhaps his Holiness, famous for his love of the ascetic, found the bare floors to his liking? I know not nor, with all due respect to his Reverence, do I care. When I marched into my room, I thought that the room might indeed be one that His Massiveness would like because it reminded me of my nana's (however hard I try, I just can't come across as of the people can I?), forgive me your Awesomeness for I have sinned in semantics, grandmothers spare room. That is to say chintz partout with a little hint of the art deco in every fitting. The light fittings, the plugs and the bathroom just howl 'George bloody Gershwin' at you, the 1930's New York Romantic Movement revisited.

Does your spirit lie within the (obsolete) jacuzzi? Is this a subliminal conversion? What is occurring? Happiness has pervaded my every pore.....The bathroom is the highlight of any Carlyle room not because I had the opportunity to view my Hellenic body in perpetuity (y'know, when mirrors face one another and the image is projected into infinity) but because it's so damn 1930's and hell, I love the 1930's.......Arsenal FC won the league title five times in the 1930's. The bathroom, with all due respect to his Utterness is a religious experience not just because of the fittings but because, on seeing how Helles had become Hell I am resolved to change my ways and drop to welterweight. God I loved this hotel. Forget that you have to pay $15 for wi-fi, $23 for a pot of coffee and a miniature whisky costs the same as a bottle from just over the street ($17) - expect to pay, enjoy the flagellation!

We had a Premier Suite, although it didn't seem that Premier compared to some of the pictures I saw of suites containing a piano. It appeared to be a renovated room but the AC was very loud, we turned off the AC at night and just used the main room's AC, but this should really not be an issue at this price.If using the Amex package, the free breakfast buffet is by FAR a better value than $50 towards room service. We got a minimal in-room breakfast that was $130, and couldn't believe how much better the buffet was (not to mention the people watching, quite the regal set). I still get a kick out of in-room breakfast, but the buffet is both cheaper and better.They need to put a few of the waiters at Bemelmans Bar out to pasture. Our first night we had some drinks and food. I'd heard about the Clooney-backed tequila, and tried one of the mixed drinks that featured it. Was great, then asked the bartender if we could try a small sample of the tequila... he smirked as if that was the dumbest thing he'd been asked that night. ""The bartenders won't do that for tequila, maybe for wine, not for liquor."" Okay, fine, not to mention that maybe a thimble-full of tequila might be an exception for a $200 tab on a $1300/night suite, but whatever - we ordered a full shot. Tasted fine, not that distinct, then on the final tab saw he'd brought us a Patron shot!?!!? The attitude plus the error of bringing the wrong drink was... look, it's not that big of a deal, until you realize that the service in the rest of the hotel is *spectacular*, so something like this sticks out as extremely rude. I'm not sure if it's managed differently, but I've seen other reviews mentioning poor service here, it's a shameful weakness to have considering how high the bar is maintained elsewhere.The service in the hotel was excellent. I did find the concierge outmatched on 2 occasions dealing with last-minute requests - I'd heard of their legendary service and partly was curious to see if they lived up to the reputation. Not quite, although for dinner reservations they were very competent. No real complaint, they did their best and were polite and professional about it.The lady raved about a spa service treatment - atmosphere and actual treatment were both spectacular, so highly recommended.Overall definitely worth a visit, we look forward to returning - the atmosphere, plus the history of the place is simply unmatched.","Los Angeles, CA","snikrep</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",2,4.0

Rosewood Hotels was offering a 'stay for three pay for two' promotion, so it seemed like an excellent opportunity to give this venerable New York institution a try.Before even setting foot through the door The Carlyle impressed me. There were a few occasions after making our reservation when I needed to contact the hotel by email, and whether it was the reservations department or the concierge desk, replies were always very prompt, professional and courteous. The outstanding service continued to impress us upon checking in, where we were warmly greeted, escorted to the lobby, and enthusiastically welcomed to the hotel by the charming clerk who checked us in. Waldo, one of the concierges, went above and beyond the call of duty trying to help us locate an iPhone lost on our flight or at the airport. We greatly appreciated his tireless efforts.I cannot recall having stayed anywhere else in the world where white-gloved elevator operators are on duty at all times: this is an extravagant service that certainly sets The Carlyle apart from other five-star competitors. It truly felt like stepping back in time for the 30 second ride up to or down from our 19th floor room. Our room was the only aspect of the hotel that we found a little disappointing. We booked the base-category (“Superior”), and despite the front desk clerk promising she had assigned us the best room in this category, it was small and showed some wear, and the view was uninspiring. Some of the furniture could have used a little maintenance, and the ceiling in the bathroom had peeling paint. At a five-star property with such a renowned reputation (and a price-point to match), perfection is expected. The 19th floor hallway too showed signs of wear: scuffed walls, frayed/stained carpeting, and elevator panel trim-work falling off. We have stayed in much larger and more luxurious suites elsewhere for much less. I was very surprised to discover that The Carlyle charges $14.95 daily for in-room wifi. When even Holiday Inns are offering this service at no charge, it seems petty of a very pricey luxury hotel not to include this service in the room rate.Despite the room’s shortcomings, we did appreciate the attention to detail in the appointments and amenities: Frette sheets and bathrobes, luxurious down duvet and cushions, Kiehl’s toiletries, and evening turndown service with bottled water and chocolates. We slept well in the very comfortable bed, although on our second night we were awakened by a boisterous group in the room next to us (soundproofing between rooms is not very good: bring earplugs).The dinner show at Café Carlyle was a night we will never forget. The setting is intimate (read: packed like sardines), the food was quite good, cocktails were well-prepared, and Debbie Harry’s performance was incredible. What a treat it was to enjoy such a dynamic performance ‘up close and personal’! It was a very expensive evening, but worth every penny. Be sure to stop in at Bemelmans Bar: cocktails are pricey but the setting is sublime.We also made good use of the small but well-equipped gym. This was a necessity given the hotel’s proximity to so many wonderful restaurants and bakeries! Because there were a number of specific restaurants in the area we wanted to visit, we did not have a chance to try the The Carlyle Restaurant or The Gallery, but both look lovely and the menus are appealing. Overall we greatly enjoyed our first stay at The Carlyle and we would definitely consider returning on a future visit to New York City. We loved the Upper East Side location with its easy access to great shopping, fine dining, and Central Park. If we do return, we will choose a different room category for a little more space and perhaps an interesting view. The reason we would return is, once again, the exceptional service from everyone with whom we came in contact during our stay. We felt safe, secure, pampered and cared about throughout our three night getaway. It is easy to understand why this has become the preferred home-away-from-home for royalty, celebrities, politicians, and travelers seeking a plush sanctuary from the hectic city.","London, Canada","Beyond_YXU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Canada</strong>",2057,5.0

The hotel itself is beautiful and historic, with the lovely Bemelman's Bar and very intimate dining area. The Bad: the mattress on our bed was terrible. I was sagging so much on one side I kept rolling toward the edge of the bed. Pillows ok, not as good as they should be in such a fine hotel. There was a fruit basket, but we much prefer the milk and cookies that were left for the girls every night at other hotels we stayed in. The Ugly: the elevator operators were awkward and made us uncomfortable. They were all very nice and friendly, but it was strange to see these men in a tiny box all day wearing white gloves and pushing buttons for you. I hope they change that in the future. No bueno. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay, but the bed was a huge discomfort. Not sure this place is worth staying all the way on the upper east side for, but it is gorgeous to look at.

You feel it ....from the caring doormen ....friendly desk staff....lobby staff who have been with the hotel staff since( I won't give away their age) and even old fashioned elevator operators. The decor is elegant as if your 1940's movie is about to begin in color .... In real life. I even took advantage of the house S class Mercedes for a short jaunt although I squinted and imagined myself in a Duesenberg. So why doesn't this magic translate to the rooms. I am sure there are some amazing suites that perhaps I have not seen ...but at the standard and deluxe levels they are always a let down. Apartment like translates to your grandmothers apartment that no one has touched in decades. They are just plain run down AND dowdy. Except for a huge flat screen tv. There so so much wasted space where there could easily have been another lounge chair. The bed sagged so much to one side I thought I would roll off.

It was wonderfully quiet. Another But ....then I was as at the back with no view whatsoever. I have had spectacular views here. Finally. ...in the scheme of crazy NY hotel prices....there are some deals to be had at these categories of rooms. Everyone should try the Carlyle and maybe a little live entertainment which they are famous for at least once in their life. Walk up Madison on a warm night and really go back in time.

The rooms are not big, at all, so we upgraded to a suite. The suite made it a bit more comfy (but the price went up a bit, naturally). Housekeeping and room service attendants were very professional and attentive-- and very sweet. We had dinner in the room one evening and breakfast one morning. Very good!! I really like the lobby bar (Bemelman's) for cocktails and good food-- where Woody Allen was playing his horn one evening while we were there. I'd have liked to have seen him and his band, but it caused a great deal of inner conflict for both me and my son (with the open letter in the NYTimes submitted by his young daughter, Dylan, and all)--- so we did not. I'd like to come stay again in April where the great Judy Collins will be playing down in the bar.

The hotel, and rooms were outstanding, it was simply the place in NYC to stay. The hotel proudly claims that all presidents, Heads of states and ambassadors have stayed he. This is true however sadly they no longer do. I was warned by friends that it is not what it once was, I refused to believe them and booked anyway, what a mistake.I arrived at the front desk looking forward to a long weekend birthday break with my wife, we had flown from London. Upon arrival the hotel couldn't find our reservation. It took me literally 30 minutes of having to go through a very dismissive receptionist to a sub manger eventually on to a manager to eventually get it sorted. I felt I had to prove that I had a reservation (which of course I did). I went up to my junior suite which was a serious disappointment. It clearly has not been touched in a long time. It was clean but frankly that's where my compliments end, I literately have nothing else remotely positive to say about it. The sofa, floorboards, walk in cupboard and curtains were shabby. The tiling grout was crumbling off and bathroom sanitary ware looked like they hadn't been replaced since the 80's. I'm not going to go on you get the point......When I arrived we went to do some shopping, came back for an afternoon nap after our long flight. When we awoke our room was freezing, (-2 outside) there was no hot water affecting both the radiators and shower (not the best when you've just come off a long flight).On our 2nd night we were awoken at 4am by a very happy lady saying ""this is your 4am alarm wakeup"" WE HADN'T BOOKED ONE!! I mentioned this to the front desk the next day and they kept telling me it was on the 'system' and 'in the computer' that I had booked one. They didn't apologise onceTo say this was disappointing experience would be an understatement it was a disaster from start to finish.

Its location on Madison Avenue is excellent for shopping (obviously!), art museums, great restaurants and Central Park. I have stayed here so very many times. In fact, for quite some time back in the 1980s, my husband kept a spacious permanent suite at the Carlyle - so it really was our ""home from home"" whenever we were back in town, visiting New York from our home in Paris! I even kept my cat Leonora at the Carlyle for a while, and there was no problem at all about her living in our suite - in fact, half a dozen beautiful little fine china dishes, decorated with flowers and butterflies, were provided (without my having to ask) for the service of her cat food. Now, that is real, genuine style! The food in the restaurant is consistently very good, and sometimes it is excellent - though perhaps not always. I can recall just one or two disappointments, but not many! Sunday brunch and afternoon tea here were always a delight.

Having experienced high teas at other prominent tea rooms around the world, the Gallery does not measure up. The photos on their website are misleading. The actual venue is not in the fashion of a traditional tea room setting. There are two lounge type areas and a sophisticated dining room that is in a separate area. We were seating in an upper lounge area adjacent to the lobby which does not live up to the intimacy of a fine tea room. The lounge area needs a serious make over as well. There was faded wallpaper on the walls and a set of old pillows on banquettes. It was very dark and dated. It lacked the sophistication and elegance which we were expecting; especially at that price point. We were offered a choice of a lunch or tea menu, expecting that afternoon tea was only served from 3 pm. Other patrons were having traditional lunch items and not tea, which detracts from the ambience of a fine tea room. The sandwiches lacked sophistication and were dry. The scones were very disappointing as they should be the edifice of the meal, but were small and dry as well. The strawberry preserves were the saving grace of the condiment plate as the clotted cream tasted uninspired and packaged. The cream lacked flavour as well and was of a hard consistency. I'm not huge on petit fours or small cakes, but they tasted like they were at least one day old and lacked flavour. Three selections per person were served; although their size was also small. The strawberry tart was adequate, the almond medallion lacked depth of flavour and we couldn't taste what type of chocolate the final offering was supposed to deliver. Overall, the service was borderline coordinated and the staff seemed somewhat impersonal.I tried the cinnamon spiced tea which was a little overpowering, kind of like those cheap red cinnamon heart candies at Valentines day.

The Carlyle is well located close to upper west side shopping, restaurants, museums and not too far from 5th avenue shopping. Our room was a very large corner room on the third floor overlooking Madison Ave. - an upgrade. While it is close to the street level the soundproofing of the windows was excellent with very little street noise and we had a nice feeling of being close to real people on the street. The bed, linens, pillows etc. were sumptuous as was the overall style and quality of furnishing and decorations in the room. Our bath room was well equipped and luxurious but very small for two people with typical kits of bathroom stuff. Our floor which has the spa and a small gym was extremely quiet. The advantage of the third floor became evident as we realized the manually operated elevators were, while charming to have an elevator man, very slow. The trip up & down to a higher floor would have been a challenge to one's patience.The hotel appeals to Europeans and Latin Americans. All the staff were very helpful and nice. I can see how someone could find them a little stiff, but we did not mind that. The overall style of the hotel is a bit dated but I like that, being a bit dated myself. It lives up to its billing as a luxury hotel and deserves its 5 stars.We did not eat in the restaurant or take advantage of the Carlyle Room as there were too many other options nearby and in NYC in general.",Cape Cod,"Howard C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cape Cod</strong>",21,5.0

We visited in mid October 2014 which was the most perfect time, not too cold or too hot...just RIGHT! The trees still had their leaves and were filled with the gorgeous colors of fall. Our trip from the airport to the Carlyle in the early evening was about 45 minutes. The experience of riding a cab over and making our way to the Carlyle was eventful in itself. My eyes were wide with wonder and enjoying every aspect of New York. New York and it's constant buzz of people and cars and buildings and more people in such a tight denomination,such a fast city, was such a wonder to me as I am used to seeing more space and people in flip flops and sweatshirts as everyday wear over the boots and coats and scarves and hats that every New Yorker was wearing.Carlyle is so close to Central Park, a quick 5 minute walk and you're there! That is why I chose it I wanted to stay near the park. The hotel itself looked very welcoming and everyone from the door attendant to the elevator attendant were so polite and welcoming. Our room was a suite decorated with comfortable furniture that made me feel like I was visiting someones home over a dreary hotel room.Had a suite to unwind in. We did not receive any fruit upon our stay which would of been nice but oh well, the fully stocked mini bar was nice.The bathroom space might have been a bit tight but it was definitely comfortable.We each had our own closets for our clothes and the temperature in the room was very comfortable. Did I mention that I loved the showers here,the water was soft and the shower felt like a spa it relaxed me so much I looked forward to it every evening and morning. Housekeeping was wonderful leaving the chocolate treats and turning down our beds at night. The room was very well appointed and relaxing, we enjoyed our stay here very much. We never made it into the restaurant or the bar here as all I wanted to do was be out seeing as much of New York as we possibly could. I had a very pleasant stay here. Yes it is an older more quaint hotel but it's charming because of that and it's located in the heart of Manhattan and 5 minutes from some of the most beautiful areas in NY how can you not enjoy it. It was a wonderful stay a wonderful place to rest after a long and busy day sightseeing.","Huntington Beach, California, United States","TFinHB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, California, United States</strong>",18,4.0

When I returned to my table I it to be occupied by another party. I approach the maitre'd whose only reply was "" you must be quicker"" and walked away.

The charge of $500 was acceptable ""only in cash"". The hotel would provide the appropriate advance, if necessary. The physician did not provide appropriate medical care.

It's was so quaint. Although a bit pricey, the service was impeccable and highly attentive. Later we found the hotel had paid for our food and drinks for the inconvenience of waiting. We were granted access to a stunning posh one bedroom suite to freshen up in. We of course hit the Central Park and time fly by. At 7pm they took us to our suite and we were flabbergasted.

I was given a suite on 9th floor, good size, usual Carlyle old fashioned decor, the suite didn't look like it had been prepared to the usual standard, my fruit basket was two depressing red apples and two tangerines, not a single flower. The lights In the suite were not plugged in, there were no drinking glasses by the mini bar the blind in the bathroom was broken, so was one in the bedroom and the only shelf in the bathroom was broken too! After my complaints some things got fixed, but more and more things went wrong. After smelling smoke in my room the next day and after a thorough investigation by security I was told I was on a smoking floor! Didn't they know me well enough by now to know I don't smoke? Finally my daughter was having surgery and I told them I couldn't get back to a room that stunk of smoke so they agreed I should move, only I was taking her to hospital and the coming back in the afternoon to put her to bed. The manager agreed to move everything to a new suite for our return from hospital, they even told my travel agent who at this point got involved from the UK. On my way back to the hotel, with my 12 year old woozy from a general anaesthetic I called the hotel ahead in order to make sure the key to the new suite was ready, only to find out that 6 hours after leaving the hotel nothing had been done. I was at my wit's ends, I am not going to bother you with the sequence of the conversations with front desk management, travel agents etc etc, i will only conclude with this: I finally settled my daughter into the new room on Thursday afternoon and I have not had a single message from anybody apologising, or asking me if everything was ok or anything else, I didn't even even get two apples and two tangerines!!",,Bea2502,10,3.0

Coffee is $9 a cup. And you're invited to tip both the wait staff and the captain, separately. Of course you will get a ballet of waiters setting dishes down simultaneously before you and your companions, if you like that sort of thing. The suites are relatively spacious for a New York hotel room, and the appointments are comfortable enough, but to get to your room you'll need to watch the elevator man (yes, there is an elevator man to push the buttons on the elevator that you could easily push yourself) slip into his white gloves and show you the respect of a house slave, which might be nice if you like to feel like a plantation master. If not, not. The service is on the whole excessive, bordering on obsequious. And it would be nice if all the lamps in the room worked and if the TV remote didn't need batteries.

What we got: the ugliest room we have ever stayed in and the worst service we have ever experienced. From the moment we checked in (our room wasn't ready at 1:30p, even though they had asked us when we would be arriving, so we were told to go away and come back, literally), and throughout the full four days, we had inferior service, an ugly room (the first room was so dark and depressing and poorly furnished - maybe redone back in the 1980s -- that I said I just could not stay in it. When we complained about the room, a woman at the front desk took us up to a room that had not yet been completely renovated; she then told us to stay in the room in which they had put us in and she would find us a room and get back to us. When she didn't get back to us, my husband went down asked another man at the front desk, who said ""well, did you book through a discount website?"" The second room, although larger, was the same (we didn't want a larger room; we wanted a prettier room). The ugly 1980s chintz curtains were literally falling off the curtain rod, the room was furnished with furniture that looked like it had been purchased at Walmart in the 1950s (see photos), and the bathroom was so contrived as to have to step all the way into the tub to turn the water on. This was not a luxury hotel stay. I don't know to whom The Carlyle is giving the luxury rooms, but it surely was not us. The staff was terrible; the entire four days, all we were asked was ""what floor?"" although we did get a '""you're welcome"" when we said ""thank you,"" and they said good morning and good night.

We stumbled upon the Carlyle many years ago and has since become our favorite hotel in New York City. The staff is among the best in New York City. It makes our children (and my husband and me) feel extra special, appreciated and welcome when we arrive and everyone says, ""Hey, Dr. and Mrs. Hardy! It's so nice to see you back."" Or ""Welcome back, girls! What adventures do you have going on this time around?!""Once you become a regular here, much more so than at other hotels we've frequented, the staff is always accommodating and ready to help with rates and special amenities. The restaurant is grand for each and every meal and Bemelman's is the best bar in New York City. The only issue I think some people may have is that the bathrooms tend to be small and connecting rooms are sometimes hard to come by. The Upper East Side location is not super convenient to much, except the Whitney Museum (it is literally a block away), the Met and Central Park, but that is usually the reason people stay here. It has a decidedly residential appeal. In very close walking distance are some of Manhattan's finest restaurants.If you are looking for an upscale, old New York hotel that is more of a home than a hotel, then you will find all you need at the Carlyle as many suites have kitchenettes as well.

If his name is Allen, you are in luck, my friend. Every time we have the good fortune to encounter Allen in the elevator, he remembers my daughter's name - and if she is with a friend whom we have brought with us on a prior visit, no matter how long we've been away, he somehow remembers her name, too. And then Allen invites my daughter and her pal to sit down on top of each other on the little corner seat and Allen sweetly croons a song from Porgie and Bess to her and her girlfriend all the way up to our floor, or all the way down to the lobby. Allen has the warmth, charm and personality of your very dear and favorite uncle. Allen is a true and irreplaceable gentleman.Gustavo, who is younger, newish, sometimes mans the door, sometimes runs the lift, carries your heavy bags around cheerfully, speaks sincerely, looks you in the eye, smiles, asks if you are enjoying yourself - and actually listens to your answer and asks follow-up questions - also remembers you every time he sees you, like you've only been away for the afternoon. Gustavo is the prompt, courteous utility outfielder of The Carlyle - what ever it is, if he can't get it done for you, he will immediately run to get you the person who can....Peter, the European Maitre d' is exceedingly formal, deferential, serious, reminds you of Mr. Carson from Downton Abbey. I consider it a personal ""win"" if I can get him to almost smile. He runs the dining room with the quiet, discreet precision of a champion sheepdog trainer. He nods and some formally dressed gentleman silently, unobtrusively jets away to refold and replace a napkin almost before you've moved from your chair.And Charles - the truly fantastic and mid-western, raised on a farm, Charles - trained at the CIA to be a chef, who is also an incredibly knowledgeable sommelier (and will, kindly, smartly, guide you toward a superior wine choice for your meal despite it being less expensive - this is good service!) - is also a superbly warm, personable and engaging room captain for the dinner hours....I don't know about you - but I love this sort of service and think it is growing increasingly rare, regardless of the price point at which you are being racked in the competitively expanding world of modern hoteliery. And as someone who stays in hotels all over the world no less than a dozen times a year, I am telling you: Nobody, anywhere, has got it all pulled together the way The Carlyle does....Which leads me to the most significant complaint that can be made about The Carlyle: The food is not exactly inedible - but I've never been able to finish any breakfast or dinner there, in all the times we've stayed, and always because the food preparation was So Very Poor. The menu is tantalizing - but the preparation and presentation look like something bland and overcooked and bluntly prepared, like a 1950's ""steak and a Rob Roy"" cliche. The food - even breakfast - whether you eat from the smorgasbord, the a la cart, or ask for special preparation - mediocre, EVERY time, EVERY season. Nothing fresh, nothing flavorful - just mediocre food. Mediocre in the Cafe Carlyle, mediocre in Bemelmans', especially mediocre in the dining room (we recommend drinks before dinner and wine with dinner - it really is the only way the food seems tolerable, especially at Carlyle prices...). My husband and I eat there more than we should considering what food snobs we are - but we get comfortable at The Carlyle and fail to reach escape velocity, or we're going downstairs to see a show and eat in the bar, and every time (not kidding) one of us turns to the other and says ""I thought we had a deal: we will NOT take meals at the hotel..."". I keep praying there will be a food upgrade, that this will change - it doesn't. Six years in now, and it doesn't.... Let me say, in fairness, I have zipped into NYC for day visits, dined in the upper oval of the sumptuously appointed Gallery room and had a perfectly lovely though not impressive or unique lunch. Solid salads, predictable but flavorful appetizers and sandwiches. It is a superb drink destination - creative with a strong, over sized pour (one drink is usually plenty) and the desserts are adequate. My husband and I love to snuggle in a banquet for a nightcap before bed after the girls have gone to sleep.Much of what I love about The Carlyle is the predictability, the comfortable lack of unpleasant surprises, the military precision of the service personnel combined with their warmth and knowledgeability which hints at staff longevity. Perhaps the hotel is loyal to a long-time chef who has lost his ability to cook even the plainest of steaks without turning them into gray, baseball mitt-grade leather, the mere scrambling of eggs into a rubbery, dingy looking, flavorless mess on your plate.... Bad coffee, boring teas, but good and plentiful butter.We must discuss the physical plant. The facility is - well, plainly - old - and in serious need of upgrading (which is promised to commence next year - there is talk of trying out several designers, including a rumor of taking style cues from Ralph Lauren whose gorgeous and enviably designed flagship mens' and women's shops are just down the street from the hotel).The lobby is one of the best in all of NYC - invitingly stepped below street level, festooned with truly creative, fresh and attractive floral arrangements that never fail to WOW. The public spaces are consistently immaculate, gleaming and seem warmly welcoming in style, chicly appointed, a fine marriage of established and modern.Most of the rooms and suites with regard to decor and ambience are beautifully shabby-chic,no two seem alike. They are worn but clean, and as durable, timeless, elegant, refined - as classically old New York glamorous as Ms. Elaine Stritch who was a long time resident, the World Famous Doyenne Chanteuse of The Carlyle (prior to her death in July). The furniture in the rooms is occasionally hilariously out of date, visually tired, sometimes strangely mismatched as if bought at a yard sale featuring style hits from the 40's through the 70's (a gold flocked, white painted Versailles arm chair with a chrome and smoked glass side table? Yup - Really.)Many of the suites saw time as small efficiency apartments in their day and are accompanied by a full, walk-in galley kitchen (no cookware available but the appliances and small sink still work). The bathrooms are an artifact of their era - tiny, practical - and in an attempt to compensate for their smallness they are lined - fully - floor to ceiling, even the cabinets, with mirrors (front, back, sides). Regardless - the bathrooms are immaculate, well appointed with excellent and heavy towels from either Frette or Yves Delorme (who makes all of Hermes' bath linens) and provided with plentiful Kiehl's cleansing amenities. T-H-E best showers I have had anywhere, period - great pressure, solid-consistent volume, easy temperature regulation, I could camp in there for a week.Among the ways we love The Carlyle: location, location, etc. Can't get enough of the perfection of this location (including being across the street from the mysteriously money syphoning labyrinth known as Zitomer's - the mad love child of a high-end pharmacy/department store coupling. Give the thrifty teenagers 50 bucks, send them safely across the street, see them three hours later proudly toting a dazzling array of really interesting cosmetic finds, jewelry and fabulous Zitomer tchotchkes).The Carlyle is walking distance to a fat slice of everything that is great about New York: museums, park, music, restaurants, shopping, quick cab down to the theater. I met a man there last year who finally bought an apartment in the Carlyle after bunking there every time his family flew in from Cincinnati, 6 times a year, to see the middle child at NYU... It was just too convenient and cost effective he claimed.. The door men are spot-on prompt about getting you a cab - very little waiting unless it is rush hour or there is some attention (and cab) hoarding event nearby - which leads to this: My child posse have scored sightings of Jagger AND Gaga there ( a Very Big Deal to the kids!).Among The Carlyle's most significant charms (the only real contender on the upper East side now that they are no longer in competition with the exited midtown hotel draw of Feinstein) is the fact that it is home base to both the Cafe Carlyle and Bemelman's musical venues, regularly featuring no less than the has-no-peer exceptional jazz guitar genius, John Pizarelli (saw him there this year doing incomparable bossa nova set with Brazilian bossa-wunderkind,Daniel Jobim; and where Pizzarelli is regularly accompanied by members of his equally genius family - his father, Bucky, from who he learned much-much, and his smoothly suave, stand-up bass slapping brother, Martin - and, when we're really lucky, his phenomenally beautiful and almost siren-voiced wife, Jessica Molaskey).Word to new patrons: If you plan to see a show at the Cafe Carlyle - be prepared to be socially engaged with the other patrons among whom you will be seated cheek-to-jowl with the merest of walking space between you and your hindmost fellow guest - and yup, the food will be mediocre, the service hectic - but that's kind of a wacky part of the charm. You're going to sit with someone from Jersey on your left (who may ask for the remainder of your butter) and the lady in full-on Hermes on your right will have come in from Italy just to see this show. It's going to be cramped, overly warm, and is not for the claustrophobic. The drinks are stiff and usually prompt, the wine list is fine, your bread roll will be cold but early - relax, the music will be great, the room is kookily but enjoyably intimate like a speak easy. There are no ""bad"" seats, so set an example and be great company for other strangers.","Boston, Massachusetts","2014Cooper17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",61,5.0

So, when on a whim, my boyfriend and I found this hotel at an unbelievably low rate (4th of July weekend), we went for it.The staff was amazing. We waited for not more than five minutes while they tried to find our reservation, but they upgraded us for our ""inconvenience."" As a result, we got to stay in a breathtaking corner room.

It was clear it had been used and wasn't replaced in between guests. The bathroom smelled terribly during our entire stay.

First, when we got to the hotel it took quite a while and a few trips to get someone to lock the door to the room that was attached to ours. Then we had to stuff things behind the headboard because it banged every time we moved. We asked for it to be fixed but it was never done which lead to a bad sleeping situation. I tried to take a bath and when I turned on the jets stuff shot out, it must have been mold because after I cleaned it out and attempted another bath I noticed mold under the soap dish and hand rails. The guy you ask questions too for recommendations was very helpful but one day a staff member was in there. Now I am 6 months pregnant, he asked me how far along I was and he said ""wow, your big aren't you"". Who says that!!! The last night we were there, we called the front desk about 4 times trying to get them to quiet our neighbor from singing and smoking really late at night. (Which the walls are super thin and you can hear everything from a dog bark to a microwave go off). Nothing was ever done and we ended up leaving at 2am.

The room is over looking Madison Avenue but since it's in the third floor we can see the people walking and they can clearly see us. We feel like we were prisoners because we can't even leave the drapes open. We travelled twice a year and we are lucky enough to be able to mostly stay in nice resorts and hotels so these experience and setting is upsetting and disappointing. I was so excited when we left California since I have read nice reviews about Carlyle but this is not the upscale hotel I was expecting. In my opinion it is better to spend the money going on vacation to Hawaii, Florida, Las Vegas and the Carolina's. We called the reception/front desk and requested to be transferred. We were told that nothing is available but that they will try to move us the next day since we are staying for 5 nights. Another reason why I'm so disappointed with this hotel is because of the uncaring attitude of the front desk staff.

This was our first stay at the Carlyle. Traveling to NYC about twice a year, we have stayed in about a dozen properties over the last fifteen years. Old faithfuls are the Waldorf-Astoria and the W. This is our new number one hotel in NYC!Views of the city and park are phenomenal. The reception staff are top notch, kind, courteous, and friendly. The bar staff are also very attentive. Housekeeping is the most professional and attentive I have seen. Looks like management is at the top of their game, because this type of service does not just happen magically. Our thanks to the entire hotel staff and management! The staff (we found out that many have been there for decades), and the location (Upper East Side, 76th and Madison) are super. However, what sets this property apart from the rest is the attention to EVERY small detail. With a long history we read about on line (Google it to find out more), this place has been the home to many presidents, royals, and celebrities. But even the commoner like me felt like royalty here. When you want to feel special, this is the place!Before we left for our trip, we received an email asking us about some of our “preferences.” I almost did not fill it out, as so often you fill out these types of forms to find that the information is never really used to make the stay special. They actually DID use the response form to welcome us like royalty, with every little detail attended to.When we checked-in, we were greeting with a lovely, friendly, professional who made us feel right at home. We inquired about spa treatments, but since we had not really planned ahead, I didn’t think we would have any luck, especially since we wanted massages for three people (all at, or near the same time). The front desk made a few calls and by the next morning, they had it all worked out and we all enjoyed massages at the super spa. A couples massage for us, and one for a friend.Other things to do at the hotel include a piano bar that has artwork by the famous Children’s book illustrator and writer of the famous Madeline books, Ludwig Bemelmans. The bar is named after him. It seats about 100 and was alive with jazz Saturday night. There is also a café that has famous singers and entertainers, but check in advance. They were sold out for our weekend, as I did not know how much there was to do at this special hotel and did not plan ahead as I should have.The lobby is nice and simple, and relatively small, with some high end shopping, a sitting area, plus a restaurant, the café, and the bar. The elevators are staffed 24 hours a day with uniformed elevator operators that keep a human eye on the security of the building. They are also equipped with cameras, but the human touch is a nice luxury from by-gone days and adds a level of security and safety, as they are very aware of who is coming and going, and seem to know the guests.Now, on to the room. Our beautiful large room had a superb view, a desk, sitting area, large TV, huge window with magnificent views, a walk in closet with mini-bar, safe, and lots of hangers. The bed was fantastically comfy and we slept like babies. The bathroom had heated tiles, heated plus white towels, a bidet, a shower/jacuzzi, robes, and slipper that actually fit! The bath products are generous portions of Kiehl’s. They smell terrific and are super! We indulged in room service for breakfast because the view was so nice, we did not want to leave the room. We were treated to outstanding surprises each night when we returned from dinner or shows, each very thoughtful, and special. Our stay exceeded ALL Expectations.

No fuss and no 'sorry your room is not ready sir' attitude. They told us to wait about an hour for the room to be 'finished', and stored our luggage. We walked to a nearby cafe, called 'Ambrosia', not knowing that it is the top cafe in the City, AND, the most expensive too. $20 for 2 cups of coffee and a croissant! Ouch! On return to the hotel we noticed the neighbourhood is chic and genteel, unlike downtown. Yet, Central Park is just there! Strawberry Field as you walk into the Park. Magical. The heat was dissipated as soon as you enter the hotel lobby, leaving the world behind. This is a hotel with history and style that the modern ones can't emulate. Even the lift has a 'lift-man' controlling the wood-panelled 'machine'. Later I learned that some floors are occupied by 'residents'. Service was excellent and the room was spacious and well appointed. Branded toiletries are a treat and the power shower a bonus. The concierge was so charming he tried to book 'The Book of Mormon' for us, but sadly it was sold out for that week. He also gave us tips about shopping and the train tickets to The Hamptons, where we were headed that Labour Weekend. Hectic you can imagine, and he even tried to use his credit card to buy the tickets for us, but we decided to take a cab to Penn Station to buy them ourselves.

The best thing about the hotel is the location on the Upper East Side which makes it close to most things a tourist wants to do as well as being only two blocks from the green line (Subway) on Lexington. We loved the elevator attendants and in particular we loved Frank, an older gentleman who has worked at the Carlyle for over 17 years.The there were only three downsides to our visit. The first was the shower. As an 'over the bath' style shower, it has a glass spray shield. However that shield was ineffective as after showering, toilet and half the bathroom floor were soaked. The second criticism was that the walls / adjoining door were paper thin so we could hear even the most casual conversation in the adjoining room. This made it frustrating when the neighbours came in late and/or were louder than normal conversational volumes. The last criticism was the pricing of food and minibar. During our stay, we choose not to dine at the hotel at all and much preferred the nearby 3 Guys Restaurant and Diner which is only half a block down Madison Ave.Overall, while it was an okay experience, if we return to New York again I think we would 'roll the dice' and try a different establishment rather than blindly return to the Carlyle","Tauranga, New Zealand","krise582</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tauranga, New Zealand</strong>",48,3.0

When my friend and I were seated for dinner our first night there, a woman sitting next to us stated that she had been waiting for half an hour for a menu. She mentioned this to us when the bread basket was delivered to her table followed a minute later by her entree. This should have been a tip off. We were mis-directed to the bar vs. Carlyle Cafe. The following morning, I was publicly threatened by the Maitre D' and told sharply, finger in face ""not to complain"" following a private comment I made to my friend. Later the Maitre D' apologized, but said he was ""stressed"" because he had 100+ patrons to serve. He did not seem to understand that stress did not justify his behavior. While waiting for a table. When my friend asked if there might be more eggs coming to the buffet table, she was told sharply by a wait person that people were busy in the kitchen and it would come when it came.

We were escorted to our room by a really nice gentleman,but the only thing was he could barely carry our luggage and his English was limited.Out of two keys only one was working which he took and was never replaced, when we asked reception they said we should have asked for another key! Wifi is not free ( $14.95 per day) but is free in he lobby and business room- which was not relayed to us arrival.1st night sleep was atrocious as there road works outside and every time traffic pasted over the section it sounded like thunder- no need to complain as next night barriers had been erected to stop the traffic passing over it(begs the question though why this hadn't been done earlier).Second night looking through menu found a card stating that we're entitled to complimentary breakfast? When we enquired the receptionist apologised and stated this had been for the previous guest (barring in mind that the rooms are turned over twice a day hard to understand why card hard been left there),receptionist was happy to honour the complimentary breakfast for the duration of our stay but then her manger turned up an said no that we had booked with Expedia and were not entitled to it! We mentioned that check in had been poor regarding the info given, to which she stated that this was standard for a five star hotel not to provide free wifi,but totally dismissed the fact level of service given was lacking.She was willing to offer us one days breakfast,we turned up at breakfast and were asked "" why are you here"",then when escorted to the table we were asked if we were guest of the hotel? On leaving the restaurant we were presented a bill- the manager hadn't relayed that we had been offered a complimentary breakfast, the staff tried to deal issue with reception but they were busy so we were asked to liaise them-no doubt all standard of a five star hotel! All very embarrassing to say the least. Oh yes forgot to say you are given complimentary tea and coffee and muffins, but nowhere other than the lobby or your room to consume it, we found ourselves loitering in the lobby to access the free wifi while drinking our drink(was given the distinct air that this wasn't the done thing).On checking out we were presented with a bill for the drinks at out complimentary breakfast, buy this time we weren't really surprised at all so we just paid and were glad to leave.Though this is a beautiful and charming hotel I feel that the staff(middle management and above)may take this for granted, the hotel obviously caters for certain clientele, so if they are going to open up bookings via third parties such as Expedia then they must be will to accept those guest and treat them in the same way, there was a vast difference in service.Having stayed at other five star hotels in a number of cities unfortunately we didn't feel that the same standard of service was extended to us which some what marred our 1st experience of New York.

We got the (im)perfect storm: all of these. This was not a bad experience for a nice hotel. This was a bad experience for any hotel. Too many great options in NYC to bother staying here. When we arrived, we were welcomed with a room with two twin beds. My reservation (via hotels.com) explicitly said One King Bed. We were told we ""were in luck"" as there was a room with a King that was $100 more per night. Terrific?! I had a meeting I risked being late to so I decided to hold the discussion until checkout - I did not expect there would be so much to talk about then. The $100/extra per night room was really....something else. They were doing heavy construction in the room next to us rendering the room off limits all day. After a day of work and meetings I was looking forward to a little rest and quiet. I stayed at the wrong hotel for that. Add in the mystery stains on the toilet and they were really on a roll. We went to a show and decided to get a drink at the lobby bar before we checked in for the night. The first drink took 20 minutes to order. We got a wild hair and decided on a second drink....we went to wrong bar for that. After being ignored for 30 minutes we tracked someone down for the check. All we wanted at that point was to sleep...we stayed at the wrong hotel for that. The A/C in our room was broken and the room was hot. A maintenance man came up and we mentioned all of the construction next door to help him diagnose the problem. He flippantly told my wife there was no construction next door - construction we had witnessed and heard throughout the day. Nothing like a lie and some attitude at 1145 in a hot hotel room. I wish I had a picture to post of the A/C unit they were going to put in our room to keep us in there. It looked like a vacuum cleaner from the 60s....sure it was a 5 star vacuum cleaner from the 60s though. The A/C problem was irreparable but we were again told we ""were in luck"". A ""comparable"" room was available. At 1145 when all your guests want is a place to lie down, what on Earth difference does it make that we get Superior, Deluxe, Suite, etc? The replacement room was fine for the 7 hours we were there. If you're counting, that was three rooms we were moved around in less than 72 hours. The next morning the front desk was very apologetic but lacked authority to do anything about it. They promised the manager would contact me. He did later that night and offered to give me the $200 back from the ""upgrade"" to King. Given we booked and paid for a King, this was not a concession but a requirement. He said he could really take care of me if I stayed there when I returned in December (something I'd mentioned to the front desk in passing). I requested that he look into our issues from this stay and try again. I rarely review and rarely complain. This was a chance to show off for my wife and they blew it so I blew it. If anything worthwhile is done, I will update this review. If for some reason you've narrowed it down to the Carlyle and another place, I hope my experience is useful. I wish I'd read a few more reviews before I booked.","Austin, Texas","TBWood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",13,1.0

It was in the reservation not possible to make a request on the type of bed for the guests. However, in the confirmation the following was stated: ""You are guaranteed the number of beds corresponding with the number of people in the reservation"" (which has also been presented as a copy to the hotel). So far so good! Upon arrival, we were informed that there was only one bed in the room, but they could offer a roll-out bed for an additional charge of USD 75 per night. Great message after a 16 hour journey!! Of course I had to say yes to the roll-out bed - alternatively sleep on the floor! After several discussions with the hotel, the presented solution is to give us the extra bed free for 1 night (!!) and offering to give me a written confirmation for the additional charge. It may be so that the third party has overpromised or misinformed me - alternatively made an incorrect reservation towards the hotel. This is in my opinion beside the point. The Carlyle chooses to let a certain number of rooms to be booked through their cooperation partner (probably to have a certain level of guaranteed coverage), and takes absolutely no responsibility for the poor customer experience we are given. Obviously, for us as the guest, it is irrelevant who did what, incorrectly. And it goes without saying that the hotel could have gone the extra mile, if customer satisfaction was of importance - instead of referring to ""the fine print"". For me this has been like flying Ryanair, where you are charged extra for every little piece of extra's - the only difference is that you actually expect that when flying with a lowfare airline and NOT from a hotel of Carlyle's supposed standards. It is also a surprise to me that The Carlyle chooses to cooperate with a dishonest third provider. In the corporate environment integrity is increasingly important - also when selecting third party providers for their business, but appearantly not for this hotel.I travel a lot in my job, and fortunately I have never experienced something even close to this!","Oslo, Norway","Cathrine38</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>",3,1.0

I'm really surprised this hotel isn't in the TripAdvisor Top 10, because it is my favorite NYC hotel by far- and I've stayed at many of them. The first thing that sets the Carlyle apart is how beautiful, quiet and dignified it is inside the public lobby areas. Rather than other hotel lobbies that are packed and filled with tourists coming in and out, the Carlyle truly feels like a private home that gets to be yours for the duration of your stay. But then when you want a livelier, nightlife atmosphere, you don't even need to leave the hotel- Bemelmans Bar is hands-down the coolest bar in the city!Yes, the Superior rooms are small and the bathroom especially tiny, BUT the decor of the room is simply GORGEOUS- I would love to have my own room at home decorated the exact same way! Just stepping inside this beautiful room made every day a joy, especially after housekeeping and turndown service made it look even more immaculate. :) Amazingly for NYC, the room was so quiet and I slept perfectly every night. I also requested a room with a view, and got a fabulous 8th-floor room overlooking the Madison Ave shopping!The food was beyond delicious! Best caesar salad I've ever had, and every dish I tried in the Carlyle Restaurant was fantastic. I was also able to order afternoon tea service via room-service, which was such a treat!Another standout was the Yves Durif Salon- I got a fantastic haircut, and a blowout that looked amazing two days later!The staff is the best I've ever encountered at a hotel- I felt truly pampered, and all requests were attended to immediately. When I first arrived and found that I'd been put in a connecting room, the staff met my request to move to a non-connecting room right away, and I was still able to get the higher floor and view that I wanted.The location can't be beat- Upper East Side shopping and dining at its best! I loved grabbing delicious meals at nearby The Mark Restaurant and Sarabeth's, and also walking down Madison and window-shopping was a blast. In short- the Carlyle is the best in NYC and I can't wait to return!",,AlexSings2U,22,5.0

Their first objective is to do a trade with you and get you into a higher price room. Maybe that's the instruction from Rosewood head office to maximise room yield but it surprised me that their intent was so explicit. After we got thru that step ( and it actually suited us to upgrade to a large suite for an extra $500 night) , they were charming. The suites are large and impressive...beds superb. There are several ""buts"" however: the breakfast is outrageously expensive and rather pedestrian in both quality and service; no overnight shoeshine; its outsourced and will cost you which seems petty to me; the doorman is probably the most disinterested member of his profession in New York city; luggage retrieval is a bit of a lottery; and be careful to find out if your room overlooks the noisy construction site on the side road. Its overwhelming advantage is its location; all the great galleries and museums are within a short walking distance and so are the best shops ...so it is a perfect santuary come 4pm on a wet afternoon.","Timbavati Private Nature Reserve, South Africa","NoelG993</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Timbavati Private Nature Reserve, South Africa</strong>",36,4.0

Breakfast selection was really good, however the buffet was seldom piping hot and could have been supplied with hot plates - tepid food served on cold plates becomes inedible very quickly. So why the but?? Tipping is not a way of life in Europe, I'm happy to tip when I've experienced exceptional service, an outstanding meal or someone's gone the extra mile.

The service is on one level excellent - attentive, kind and gentle - very much of a bygone age. However some practices belong in the past and should be consigned to history. One of these is using lift attendants. As soon as you say what floor you want, the attendant turns and faces the wall as if they weren't there. I've heard of discretion but I found it rather uncomfortable - it just seems wrong nowadays to tell somebody else to press a floor button for you but in many ways the lift attendant at the Carlyle acts as a metaphor for the establishment. I do like very good service but I don't expect the person delivering the service to be submissive in any way and I found that some of the staff (not all!) were submissive - just wanting to blend in with the walls.We had a two bedroomed suite which was well-appointed and adorned with fresh roses. One gripe was that our bathroom was tiny - one of those spaces where a kitten couldn't have been swung! My other criticism would be that it was a bit shabby. Many of the hallways and walls looked like they urgently needed a refurb.We only ate room-service breakfasts at the hotel which were always perfect and delivered on time, so our experience of the catering was very positive.So in summary yes it's a grande dame but I didn't really warm to the hotel and there were aspects which I wasn't that keen about, so I don't think I'd return here with so many other upper-end options in New York.","London, United Kingdom","TM99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",366,4.0

Situated just of Maddison Avenue within walking distance to midtown attractions and close to Central Park.On checking in with a very polite and welcoming reception we were told our rooms were not quite ready but we did arrive a little earlier that the checkin time due to our scheduled flight time, so this was not a problem. Our luggage was taken and stored for us whilst we ventured out into the city.We were allocated room 910 which delighted when we first walked in. The size of room was more than adequate with a walk in a wardrobe which also housed the minibar. The bathroom was a little small but this was masked by the mirrors on all four walls. The only slight critisicm was that there was no space between the bedroom and the room door leading onto the corridor.The public areas of this hotel are a return to a bygone age and such a pleasure to be in. A member of staff is always close by and on the whole looking to attend to your needs. I say on the whole because when I just wanted a drink at the bar in Bemelmans I had to wait when being the only person there. When served for the first time however each visit to the bar (after my wait) the bar tender did remember my order.Cafe Carlyle was a delight with a good meal and excellent entertainment, thank you to the restaurant captain and the waiting staff and a very big thank you to Herb Alpert and the band for a wonderful night of jazz.

It was our first return since 2008 when we got engaged there. The property seems to have just gotten even better since our last stay. Service was outstanding and attention to detail was excellent and the place is so classy. We stayed at Four Seasons New York in November 2012 and much preferred The Carlyle. The property is much smaller and has much more of a boutique feel than the Four Seasons. We used the fitness center and spa and both were excellent. Spa services were outstanding. The spa is small but cozy and well maintained with a terrific front desk staff. Fitness center is small, but adequate with four state of the art treadmills, dumbbells and other machines. There was an attendant available for anything you might need. There also some personal training going on so that is available as well. White-gloved attendants work the elevators, which is a nice touch and must cost the hotel a fortune to maintain. Some reviewers seem to think it is a bit much, but we enjoyed this service and feel that it creates a refined atmosphere. Always having a friendly face greet us when the elevator door opened and announcing our floor when we arrived was appreciated. We felt truly special as guests. The décor of the hotel is stunning. Rooms are mid-century modern and charming. We stayed in Room 705 which was a deluxe room and was very spacious and even had a heated bathroom floor and WIC. Common areas and hallways are beautiful. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bell staff were very helpful. Concierge was also very helpful. In particular, concierge Waldo as extremely helpful, pleasant, informative, enthusiastic and responsive. He set up all our reservations even before we arrived and made a few revisions during our stay…he was just a text away! Location is perfect – right in the heart of great Madison Avenue shopping. It is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas which makes it much more relaxing than other properties that are closer to more of the action. We spent some time in Bemelman's Bar listening to pianist/vocalist Chris Gillespie, which we always enjoy. Chris plays jazz standards, show tunes, etc. between 5.30-8.30 p, and creates a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of days gone by. The bar itself is usually quite crowded and loud at times with all the martini drinking, but the maître d does a nice job of assisting with seating and comfort. Service in the bar is outstanding. Breakfast was buffet style in the Carlyle Restaurant, a stunning room. Service at breakfast was excellent and maître d Patrick was most gracious. We did not dine at Café Carlyle although the concierge offered to get us a table to hear Woody Allen. Unfortunately, it did not fit in with our plans, so we had to pass. All in all, this is a stellar, one of a kind property that anyone seeking an exquisite Upper East Side experience should not miss. Much better than the FSNY. Thanks to the entire staff at The Carlyle for a most enjoyable and elegant stay. Check out the photo I posted which says it all.","Lancaster, Pennsylvania","timrobin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lancaster, Pennsylvania</strong>",117,5.0

If I had seen the room photos before booking, I would have reserved elsewhere.I was greeted by Larry at the front desk and I cannot recall a worst experience checking into any hotel. Everything started with “No” and ended with “I’m sorry m’am.” I think he is most comfortable checking in old men than he is younger women.I tried the spa, which was fabulous, got one of the best blow dries at the salon and beautiful massages during my stay. What I did not appreciate was that my masseuse’s tip was automatically added to my bill which would be handed to me with a “I hope it’s ok I added 15% to your bill” for a massage that is already $200/hour. After the second massage I asked about this practice and was told it’s because Europeans don’t tip and this is one way to make sure they do. Wait, I am not from Europe.One other thing I reproach the hotel is not making any distinction between guests and non-guests when it comes to the hotel bar and restaurants. There is rarely any space to sit and have a meal or a drink. So your default option is room service if you don’t feel like going out. The steak is $60 on the room service menu, with delivery charges, taxes and tips, you get a $100 steak delivered in your minuscule room, how’s that for value?Also, there was a wedding reception the weekend I was there and the walls being paper thin, it was impossible to get any sleep before all the other guests were passed out. And that was a little after 3 a.m. Front desk could or would do nothing about it. They were actually not very receptive to hearing about it.The positive are the location, the concierge services are impeccable (I got a table at excellent restaurants on very short notice), love the Kiehl's guest toiletries, finally, Frankie and the other lift men make up for the dated space that the elevators are.I would not go back because I believe that at that rate, I can be much better accommodated elsewhere in NYC.","Toronto, Canada","Reine P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",19,3.0

The service was wonderful and this beautiful hotel is wonderfully situated just a block from Central Park and close to many museums & restaurants on our itinerary. The rooms are not large but they are very pretty and the staff works to keep you happy. No matter the request, you are treated courteously and all issues are resolved as smoothly as humanly possible. We had a continental breakfast delivered to our room each morning and it always showed up at the exact time we had requested the night before. The coffee was good and hot and the pastries, fresh fruit & fresh squeezed juice were delicious. The bathroom was also not particularly large but it was outfitted with everything you could possibly need and it was a very nice shower. We had a balcony outside our 21st floor room and the views of the city were spectacular. We also had an Irish coffee in the bar the afternoon we arrived and enjoyed our warm drinks. The doorman was always happy to chase down a cab or lend us an umbrella. The elevator operators though unnecessary were so very kind and friendly, we learned to enjoy seeing them as we rode up and down. All in all a truly exceptional experience.

We thought we'd pay a little extra for something special. From the reviews and photos (how they get those angles is anyone's guess!) it seemed to be a classy place. However on arrival our Classic room was a huge disappointment; it was on the 9th floor with a view of a brick wall about 30ft away - nice. This also made it dark and dingy. For $495 a night this seemed a bit of a joke. I asked for a different room and for an extra $25 per night we were moved to the 19th floor which was at least level with the other rooftops so a bit brighter but the view was still uninspired. One good thing was the shampoo/shaving products they were top class, however the jacuzzi bath probably hadn't been used since the 1930s as when we tried it lots of crap from the pipes came out - bits of copper and dirt etc. By this point we were ready to leave. The $14 A DAY! for WIFI in the room makes the place feel 'cheap - no frills'. Breakfast was poor. The fruit I had was dry and the pastries small and not very fresh. We had stayed in the SOFITEL in Washigton DC the previous 3 days and breakfast was fantastic in all respects if not just as pricey - $60 for two at both hotels. The other annoying thing was the lift attendants especially as the lifts are tiny there is not much room for anyone else! However there seemed to be some very 'special' people staying at this hotel, some I think live there...you know the sort of people who are too precious to press a button on lift. I got the feeling the Carlyle is more of a club/institution you pay to be there rather than what you get. Thing is they don't realise - you can't buy class! The staff were very attentive especially the receptionist & concierge who were great but we felt some of the others were too friendly/in your face ogling for a tip all the time, a little disingenuous - maybe that's just NY culture?! On the last night we were going to go to the bar as there was some jazz playing - i had taken a jacket and some smart clothes especially as this was mentioned on the website, however we were informed it would be $25 each to get in the hotel bar after 9pm! Even though we had spent over $1000 with them in 48hrs...it just felt like an insult to us, so we went out instead.

The service was certainly acceptable, but not exceptional.The location of the hotel is super, particularly for shoppers or museum-goers.

There are aspects of this hotel that I love-- location, art deco design (particularly in the lobby), Bemmelman's bar, excellent service.That said, what I do not love is that the hotel-- and in particularly the rooms, hallways and elevators-- feel old, tired and threadbear.There have been some efforts made by laying new carpet in the rooms, updated beds and bed linens and a few other touches, but the overall feel is tired. The bathrooms are very old. They used top of the line materials when they were build, but after decades of use they look worn and outdated. Same goes for the old, rickety herringbone wood floor. Most of the furniture in the rooms looks cheap and very outdated (as opposed to fine quality, and antique).The Carlyle is pricey. There is a cost for all this history and prized location. But, as its long-time customer base ages, serious changes (upgrades) will need to be made if it's going to retain its position at the top of the market.","Boston, Massachusetts","rome1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",106,4.0

The public areas, in particular the Lobby with its immaculate black marble floors and Bemelmans Bar with its beautiful murals, are unique and worth a visit in their own right. Service is discreet, proper and quite reserved but without being stuffy or pretentious. In fact we were made to feel quite welcome and the hotel felt like home very quickly.Our room (I think it was a ‘Classic Room’) was quiet, comfortable and very spacious with two walk-in wardrobes (amenities included the usual array of clothes hangers as well as a wooden clothes brush, full size shoe horn and golf umbrella) and a kitchen/private bar (fully stocked with top quality local products). Oak parquet floors were partially covered by a large, thick rug of high quality. Furnishings were antique but well-maintained with hardly a trace of wear and tear. The bed was large and extremely comfortable with linens, pillows and duvet of the finest quality. The bathroom was small but luxurious with powerful water pressure and excellent Kiehls products. Room service for breakfast was excellent as you would expect – superb coffee and croissants, beautifully presented.The only criticisms I would make of the room are that it didn’t have much of a view (the courtyard isn’t very attractive) and a surcharge was payable for WiFi, although the connection speed was very fast.A few problems occurred during our stay and they were handled competently by the staff. When we arrived at the hotel there had been an issue with the booking (Virgin had supplied incorrect dates) and a room had to be specially prepared for us. The receptionist escorted us to Bemelmans Bar where we were treated to a performance by a Jazz quartet and served excellent food and drinks on the house while we waited for our room to be prepared.Unfortunately I was substantially overcharged at check out only to notice upon returning home. The accounts department were quick to rectify the discrepancy and compensated me for the loss I incurred due to a change in the exchange rate.Overall this was a memorable stay in a unique, historic hotel.",London,"WillJMitchell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",22,5.0

We stayed at The Plaza the night before. Regrettably, it was a wrong decision to leave The Plaza for The Carlyle. For the same amount of money, The Plaza screams opulence in everything including SERVICE! I booked the Carlyle room through Oyster.com which came with free breakfast. On our check out day, I called front desk regarding the free breakfast. The lady denied that my accommodation did not come with the free breakfast. I informed her that it is contained in my email which she asked to have a copy of it. So, I went down to show her the said email which was in my iPhone. I was asked to forward the said email to a Carlyle email add. Then, I was asked to wait as she had to make calls first (most possibly to verify the veracity of the email in my inbox). She made me wait for almost an hour but still no action. I felt like we were beggars waiting for our rations in a corner. I felt humiliated deep inside knowing that I am not white and I could have been served better. My husband was telling me that we should just eat outside but I told the front desk lady that I wish not to wait any further and I will pay for our breakfast instead. We headed to the restaurant and we were seated by a staff and menus were handed to us. Then, the head waiter came to our table and told us that they could not accommodate our son because he was wearing shorts. I was completely aware of the dress code but overlooked his outfit. What was highly frustrating though was this young lady inside the restaurant was just wearing a very skimpy shorts and looking like a w____! Not only that, she was wearing flip-flops too but her Grandma is apparently a resident. I didn't say anything and so my son went back to our room and changed into pants. During check out, I was informed that my breakfast was already taken care of. She made it sound that it was a nice gesture from the hotel. Hah, as if that was a favor from them!I should NOT HAVE WAITED for almost an hour for something that should have been accorded to me because I PAID (and pre-paid with Oyster) for it in the first place. And, Mr. Manager, even if you reply to this complaint, I am advocating others not to stay in this hotel. The damage has been done and you could not rectify it. I urge others to go The Plaza instead, join their club (Fairmont President's Club) for free and check out the members' benefits. Free wifi, free limo ride, free parking, too.

The venue is very small and offers great views from every seat. The intimacy of the venue allows the guest artist to interact easily and comfortably with the audience. This night was very special as Steve Martin and his wife were also in attendance (a classy gentleman that appeared to be shy and courteous to the artist who is a friend of his, and to the patrons that said hello to him; one asked for an autograph). Steve Tyrell of course, was awesome!Attending a show at this venue is quite expensive but a very special treat. If this is out of your budget then save your money and come for that special occasion.

We had considered staying in mid-town (we usually stay at The London) or downtown as we had our teenager with us, but this deal was too good to pass up. Well, we are now spoiled for life! We don't ever want to stay anywhere else. We had an enormous room with windows that opened across one side of the room. There were curtains and shades for light control. It was beautifully decorated in blues and tan and was very quiet. Our son's room was also very large and nice, although it was a bit darker as he had fewer windows. The staff was very nice (although it is a bit awkward to have elevator operators) and helpful. The only downside (slight) was that the bathroom was on the small side and had a shower/tub combo rather than a separate shower. The concierges were good. One helpful concierge recommended that we find theater tickets online as they would be cheaper and we were able to find excellent seats for Book of Mormon that evening. We loved the location. There was a subway line close by and we enjoyed walking through the park.

It remains one of my favorite hotels. I had a north facing room on an upper floor in the tower with views of Central Park. The room (queen bed with great linens) was modest in size, but comfortable. Furnishings might have seemed dated, but recognizing that much of it was Dorothy Draper allowed an appreciation of the classic look. Everything was impeccably clean. Bathroom was well appointed with toiletries from Kiehl's and the house bar soap that I instantly remembered from years ago. The bathroom had no shortage of mirrored surfaces (to the point of being a bit much). Closet space was abundent. Service was great, from the front door to reception to the maids, elevator attendants (!) and bell staff. Suit and shoes pressed and polished in short order on Saturday afternoon. Climate controls worked nicely. Only drawback: the obnoxious charge for WI-Fi access. At this price point for a room, Ido not believe that one should not be asked to pay. But I suppose at this price point, one should not be thinking too much about another $15 per day. The hotel is well located at Madison and E. 76th. Not the best location if you want to do the usual tourist thing, but exceptional for shopping on Madison, access to Central Park (one block), museum mile, the 6 train at Lexington and E. 77th and only a few minutes walk to Sushi of Gari (not to be missed, reservations recommended). Room price for the weekend was comparable to Four Seasons and Peninsula, and while those hotels are more modern and attractive in their way, the same price would have yielded me an interior or adjacent building view at those properties, and nothing can beat an upper east side location with a good view of the park for a fun and relaxing weekend.","New York City, New York","6101FCD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",21,5.0

However, this one has been grating on me ever since.We stayed at the Carlyle for a weekend at Christmas 2009 as a present from our daughter. My biggest disappointment was the treatment we received from the staff. Because we didn't have bundles of money to hand out to staff in tips for bringing us a few slices of toast and opening a door, we felt that the service we received was non existent. In fact it felt like we were shunned. We did tip but obviously not enough.The first room we were booked into was nice but not the one that my daughter paid for. Our second room was also nice but some of the furnishings were old and worn (not something you would expect from a 5* hotel).On booking out, although my daughter had already paid for our room, we were still charged. After some discussion the bill was put right.The limousine that we booked to take us back to the airport did not turn up. We spoke to the receptionist who told us 'don't worry the hotel has a limousine that can take you' She was obviously new because , when the car did not turn up after another 15 minutes, she was no longer at the reception and we were told to go to the concierge and no further mention was made of the courtesy car. The concierge tried twice to make contact with the company supplying the Limousine but eventually offered to arrange a taxi. We paid out $100 for a 15 minute ride.So, if your Tony and Cherie Blair, John Malkovich or a Rock star, all staying at the hotel the same time as us, you would be ok.

Whereas the Mandarin Oriental (second best 5 star in NYC) has got a fantastic location and nice rooms, the feeling of classic 5 star tradition blended with the difference in crowd means that the ambience is different in a positive way. From the head concierge that actually knows it all and has been around for a long time in the same hotel, bartenders that makes cocktails the hard way from scratch into perfection till the SPA that is somewhat smaller in size having been fitted into an old building, but designed by someone banned by any 5 star chain hotel due to their extravagance in spending cash on details - the hotel will impress you! Yes, some of the rooms are smaller than you might want, and some are older than I like (somewhat dated), but you feel good being there.

The Good: location, the quiet and sublime lobby, the concierge especially Dwight, the residential feel of the place, good mattress and pillows but not excellent, good cappucino's. The Bad: small bathrooms with zero luxury as in no heated towel bars, no heated floors, no oversized tubs, no counter space around the sinks, no dimmers on the switches. The closets : pretty good sized but mediocre layout, rooms are not very well decorated, ceilings are not high enough and the interior hallways are on the narrow side. The Ugly: every computer and iPad has to pay 14.95 a night for Internet which in my case meant 4 laptops and I was already spending a few thousands night for our suite. They alculated breakfast in our sitting room the most expensive possible way which meant 150$ for breakfast for 2 and I don't eat eggs. I enjoyed the Park view from the table and chairs on our wrap around terrace and I loved the linen sheets but both these were requested in advance and were expected and neither was there when we arrived and it took a few alls plus the intervention of our concierge travel Svc in NYC to get done.

Usually I stay at the Surrey, but I thought I would give this hotel a try, because I heard they had renovated the rooms. The photos on the website looked amazing. I booked some sort of suite and they upgraded me to, I guess, a bigger one--and it was huge, no doubt about it. There was even a grand piano. Unfortunately, it wasn't that comfortable...or clean. The furniture was old and sparse, and it was too small for the rooms. The couch in the living room looked downright manky. Through the holes in the radiator covers (which were large and very visible from the couch) you could see big piles of lint and scuzz. The bed was lovely and the bed linens were absolutely first quality, but the lumpy brown carpet made the room feel old. And the bathrooms (two full and one half) seemed either old or improperly cleaned. There were lines of black (fungus?) around the caulking. Where are they hiding the beautiful suites pictured on the website?! Were only some of the rooms renovated? Did they run out of money and do a more thorough job on some rooms than others? And why have people employed full-time pushing elevator buttons when there is such a problem with cleaning and maintenance? That seems truly bizarre to me.On the upside, the hotel has a great Upper East Side location, walking distance from the Met and other wonderful museums. The bar/restaurant is fun and very old New York.

Wonderful old-style NYC hotel, top quality amenities (bed, soaps, etc etc etc) BUT . . . charging $15 per day for wi-fi access in a room costing almost $1,000 a night all in is too cheap for words. I think you simply have to adjust your expectations in NYC hotels. We thought we had and although we were taken aback at first with the tiny room (and especially tiny bathroom), we were won over by the top quality furnishings and the relative silence of the upper east side. The staff are almost TOO friendly (where do you see elevator attendants anymore, although I suspect they are required not so much as a luxury but more to keep the travelling riff-raff from running around on floors reserved for permanent residents). The view to the south from our 31st floor was almost worth the room price in itself, but as luxury hotels go, we have had more value for money at the Waldorf and the Standard, and the Peninsula in Chicago. Unfortunately, elevators are also very tiny (old-style) and apparently don't have room for the usual luggage trolleys, so the bell staff sort of work in teams to move your luggage by hand - kind of weird and inefficient, but unfailingly polite and gracious. Also, the old walls are very thin, so that you can easily hear a normal conversation the the adjacent room (and when you share your floor with the sort of inconsiderate boors who ought not to be staying there in the first place and can't grasp the concept of considerate quiet at 0700 on a holiday morning, then you REALLY realize how thin the walls are, but you can't blame all that on the hotel.)We might return for the location and the wonderful old-style class and charm, but we might also check out The Mark in the same location.

We had very high expectations from the 5 stars rating of the hotel and the beautiful pictures on the hotel's website. Although the linen and the towels were excellent quality (and changed every day!) and the beds very comfortable, the rest of the furniture looked old and run down. The bathroom was the worst part: we think that this needs major renovation. For instance there were dark stains (fungus??) on the shower head and the corners of the bath tub. The paint on the ceiling of the bathroom was getting off. The closing of the bath tub was missing. Last but not least, the bath tub was not properly cleaned every day: it was simply washed with water and one could see that no soap or special product was used. Besides, we were awaken 2 times by the cleaning lady. Once she rang several times in the morning while she knew we were still in the room. She tried to give one of us a high pile of linen to put on the bed (we then politely asked her to put them herself inside!!) as she didn't feel like coming back for that later.

The hotel is on the corner of 76th and Madison Ave so the shopping was fab! From Creed to JonathanAdler to Frette and all the big name designers Gucci, Valentino, E.Armani. I was worried that any room would be loud in NY, but soon as our rm door was closed it was silent in our room which I highly valued. All in all with all the options available re: hotels in NY I am satisfied with my stay at the Carlyle, the only thing I raised a brow to was the charges for wireless internet - that being said the reception staff was ALWAYS ready to print anything we every needed and the the business centre is comp as well. The rooms and paint could use some updating, it would only add to the charm of this great hotel and its staff. Oh by the way... the toiletries are Kiehls... for a product junkie like me... I thought I should mention that ; )","Kelowna, Canada","jos_9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

Room service was very prompt, hot, and tasty. I booked through the AMEX Fine Hotels program, and was lucky enough to get an upgrade one night to a tower room (spectacular!) and I made good use of the $100 spa credit, too.

Truly everyone was cheerful and polite -- an elevator operator even broke into song on one occasion, and he was very good, too!

To celebrate a 21st. A celebration type hotel was called for. Of course in the States the 21st is a big thing as alcohol becomes legal.Usually we have stayed in Midtown but this time we went to the posh end of town and the Upper East Side. We booked The Carlyle. Although we were a little concerned that it might be a little stuffy we plumped for it because of its history, its reputation, its fame for jazz and its proximity to Central Park which was condsidered a bonus bearing in mind we were going in summer. We were thankful that we had as the temperatures reached staggering highs and a stroll through the trees of the Park was welcome on more than one occasion.What then about the hotel itself. Quite simply it is, as the Americans would say, awesome. In a city which can at times be revolting in its brashness and ability to go completely OTT this is a place that is luxurious yet measured, restrained, and subtle. It is comfortable with being what it is - that is - pure class - and does not need to shout it from the its very high rooftop.We were greated by the special events manager who had responded to my request for adjoining rooms. She gave us only one room key on arrival however - saying some finishing touches were to be done to the birthday girl's room. We soon found out that these touches were the delivery of complimentary Champagne and cake to get the celebrations off to a wonderful start.We spent time in the bar - birthday girl showing that her 3 years of UK drinking practice had not gone to waste - as she sampled a number of fantastically executed cocktails. We listened to the relaxing jazz. We admired the extraordinary murals on the walls.We had breakfast in the Restaurant - once I had been sent back to the room as I was wearing shorts which were not acceptable - quite right too - I felt my self saying.We sampled the lounge where it is said the great and good of yesterday, the Hepburns and Kennedys would meet, and where the great and good of today clearly still do.The service throughout the hotel was impeccable, the food excellent, the drink better. The rooms old style proper total comfort with all the amenities you could need, the ipod dock and flat screen TV sitting well with the French influenced furniture and marble bathrooms. The hotel lobby and public areas understated in elegance with great art and objects and yet a well equipped and complimentary business centre..If you want urban cool and modern minimalism dont stay here.The Carlyle is a hotel of a different age, an age of classic beauty and refined living, but it retains its relevance in today's world by being exemplary in every way.It is an oasis from both the constant rush of the city that never sleeps and the world which seems never to even take a breath.

We arrived too early to check in on a very wet day. We were promised a phone call when our room was ready but otherwise we braved the heavy downpour. Hours went by and no phone call. In desperation we returned to be greeted by reception staff who had no trace of us or our request for a call. Despite it being past 3pm (the normal check in time) there was still no room for us. We were given an upgraded room - which in fairness was just lovely. But the hotel's reception desk staff seem more interested in talking to each other than assisting. More than once we stood patiently waiting for attention only to be ignored. 'Hello??....' The last straw? On the last day we rang down to ask for assistance with baggage. 'Of course, someone will be up directly...' 25 mins later with a plane to catch we struggled downstairs ourselves. The reception was deserted except for the reception desk clerk filing his nails and two uniformed bellhops standing idly by ... chatting...

The bath had a separate shower and tub and good lighting. A little mildew along the caulk in the shower, but easily overlooked. The bed was the best thing about the room, no smell of any kind, it was like sleeping on a new mattress and pillow. I am really picky about odor, and my room was very fresh!!!

These were my 15th and 16th stays at the hotel, respectively.The Carlyle continues to be one of my favorite hotels, worldwide. This is a hotel of timeless elegance and gentility, with a high level of service and personal attention. It’s a hotel with staff continuity – some the bell staff, room service staff and doormen are the same as on my first visit in 1992. They remember me from stay to stay, and I am warmly greeted. That continuity provides something intangible, and very valuable.During the August, 2010 visit, my wife and I had a Premiere Suite on the 4th floor, overlooking 76th Street. The suite had a half bath, kitchenette, large living room (with grand piano) and bedroom with full bath. The “Deluxe” and “Premiere” suite categories seem to be exactly the same except that, in the Premiere Suite category, one of the two walk-in closets has been turned into a separate shower stall, allowing a separate soaking tub.The room was very well appointed. Each of the two easy chairs and sofa in the living room were inviting and comfortable. The easy chair in the bedroom was also very comfortable. I’m picky about lighting, and all of the seating locations were well lit. The grand piano was cool to look at, but didn’t serve much purpose for us. As is always the case at The Carlyle, the bedding and linen were of highest quality (Frette, I believe). The bed was excellent.I visited the hotel alone for the October, 2010 stay, and stayed in a tower room somewhere in the 20s – my first opportunity to stay in the tower portion of the hotel. My view was to the east – and was spectacular. The bathroom also had a window, and I could enjoy the same view while “seated”, so to speak.The tower room had a comfortable easy chair, with very good lighting nearby. It also had a walk-in closet. On the both stays, housekeeping was flawless. Everything happened when it was supposed to, and how it was supposed to happen. The door service and elevator service was friendly and prompt.As has always been the case at The Carlyle, the HVAC worked flawlessly during both stays, and both rooms were exceptionally quiet (this was a pleasant surprise for the 4th floor room, which I expected to pick up more of the Madison avenue traffic noise).I have some rules that guide my stays at The Carlyle.1) I like bright rooms. Because of that, with the exception of the Premiere Suite mentioned above that was on the 4th floor, I normally stay no lower than the 8th or 9th floors. I’ve found the lower floors much darker when it come to natural light.2) I follow my “old hotel rule” when I stay The Carlyle – which is, never stay in the cheapest room in an old hotel, because those rooms can be very very small and/or look into air shafts. From the floor plans, I do perceive that there is at least one room on each of the lower floors that would fit into that category.3) If breakfast is not included in my room rate, I eat breakfast elsewhere, since it is priced at a very high level. 4) I’m always very cautious about room service. Very thirsty during one summertime stay, I ordered a pitcher of Iced Tea (how much could it cost, I thought?). Thirty-nine dollars (before the tip), was the answer. I learned my lesson.The Carlyle is never cheap, although good rates can be had if one looks for them. The service has never disappointed over the past two decades. I’ve never had any failings of any the fundamentals – plumbing, noise levels, electrical, HVAC, bedding, lighting and the like. It has met all of my expectations consistently throughout all of my stays.I strongly recommend The Carlyle to anyone who looks for a classic, high service hotel stay with no surprises.","New Albany, Ohio","OrrvilleRedRider</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Albany, Ohio</strong>",432,5.0

I found the Carlyle to be the epitome of old New York style and grandeur. From the front desk to the white-gloved elevator operator to the cleaning staff, everyone we encountered was helpful and polished. The suite was the largest I've stayed in New York City. It had a large bedroom, living room, separate fully-enclosed kitchenette, full bath off the bedroom, and 1/2 bath at the entrance. It was larger than my 2-bedroom Back Bay Boston apartment! The location is wonderful, conveniently located one block from Central Park in the gorgeous Upper East Side.The few downsides were the kitchenette was very dated. Also, it was stocked with a few wine and champagne glasses, but after we used them the first night, the maid staff took them to be cleaned but never brought us a clean set.Full disclosure, if I had paid full price, I would have expected a more updated kitchenette and a better view.

I'm 60 and have stayed at fine hotels all over Europe and in major US cities. This is the worst hotel experience I've ever had. Off the entrance hallway to our suite was a kitchenette with Formica counter tops and appliances that had seen better days many years ago. The rug in the living area was stained and frayed at the edges. There was a jagged tear in the curtains that looked like it had been repaired by a child. The bathroom was completely walled in mirrors to disguise how incredibly tiny it was. I really doubt that 2 adults could have stood in the bathroom at the same time. After arrival, I called housekeeping to ask for a bucket of ice, since there are no ice machines on the floor, and finally, an hour later, on the third phone call, I just told them to forget it. Breakfast each morning in the restaurant was included in our room package and was about the quality one would expect at a Denny's. We asked to see another room and were shown a Deluxe Suite which was actually in worse physical shape than our first suite, so we just let it go. The Carlyle may have been the epitome of Art Deco splendor when it was built in 1931. In 2011, it's merely faded, tired looking, and cramped. If you really want to stay in a wonderful hotel, go stay in the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco. It, like the Carlyle, is housed in an older, historic building, but the difference in quality between the two hotels is like night and day. If you're in New York, anything would have to be better than the Carlyle.","Jackson, MS","es335tdc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jackson, MS</strong>",35,1.0

I wanted an intimate space with windows and views plus impeccable service for my traveling guests. The Carlyle far exceeded my expectations in this respect, but wait, here's the best part, the room minimum was much more reasonable than other private rooms in the city! So much so that we had an opportunity to add on passed ors'devors that were to die for!During the planning process our event manager, Caitlin, was attentive and responsive to our every need. Caitlin provided us with group block discounts for those staying at the hotel, menu suggestions, layout ideas and floral recommendations. When my daughters decided that they wanted to do table arrangements, Caitlin volunteered the floral room for our use. This was totally unexpected and made the preparation for the event so much fun as we totally felt like inside staff. Caitlin also hunted down a projector for us to show a slide show during the event and the other waiters and staff members were the most friendly and professional people I have ever dealt with. When we first arrived, our room was upgraded to a two bedroom suite and myself, daughters and bridesmaids were treated to a huge sitting area for entertaining, kitchen, entrance foyer with real leather bound books plus two huge bedrooms with apartment like furnishings and fine, European linens. A fruit basket was waiting for us as well. At the event, everyone appreciated the elegant setting, delicious food and overall ambiance and mood. Even after the event was through, the hotel didn't mind the lingering guests as there was not even a suggestion to be ferried off to some other area. We did, however, retreat to the lovely sitting room in our suite for the opening of the gifts. it was the perfect place to unwind and have the convenience of a home away from home. It was even a breeze to ship off all the presents as a package assistant arrived with shipping forms and the whole lot was effortlessly transported to the package room and sent to our residence within a few days. It is really rare that you get to stay in an intimate hotel where your every need is anticipated and you are greeted by super friendly staff at all hours of the day. When my daughters went shopping, they were offered the private Mercedes and only had to tip the driver. Seriously? Where does this happen in this day and age? Honestly, anyone who thinks this hotel is stuffy and overpriced, clearly does not have an appreciation for the finer aspects of travel and entertaining away from home.

Whilst the ground floor of the hotel is undoubtedly impressive, the rarefied, or snooty, atmosphere leaves one feeling slightly uncomfortable. Our room on the 8th floor could best be described as shabby chic. It had obviously once been a very nice room but was in dire need of a makeover. We ventured into the hotel bar to find that there was a $50 dollar cover charge just to sit down, not including drinks – needless to say we didn’t stay. Even if I were extremely wealthy, I don't think I would welcome being ripped off in this way.

That service is delivered with the quiet confidence that comes from decades at the top. The rooms are all that you would expect from the average superluxury hotel. The cocktail bar is charming, the room service delicious. But it is a legend that feels just a lot more real than the competing realities. You are a guest here, not a credit card and a loyalty program. So to all you other establishments out there, well let's come back in, say, 50 years and see how you are getting on.

I should confess that if I'm spending bucks, I like newer updated places, like the Mandarin chain, some of the Four Seasons properties, and funky places like the Hotel on Rivington. The Carlyle is an old upper east side throw-back. Apparently it's Sarkozy's digs when he's in the city. The bar is historic and charming. On arrival, my room wasn't ready, so the staff put me in the bar and comped me a martini. The room was spacious by NYC standards, but really old and dated. It had obviously been set up with twin beds! Lucy and Desi style! They pushed them together with an overlay to make a king bed for me, though. Exposed heating duct pipes and painted over wires along the floor and under the window. The chrome and old marble bathrooms were straight out of a ""high class"" 60's movie. My impression is that it's a hang-out for moneyed folks looking for exclusivity and subtlety.

That being said it is not for everybody, but if you value personalized service with a unique and classy atmosphere then this hotel is for you.The Carlyle is also a residential building which has hotel rooms right next to residential apartments. For example, the only complaint I had was that next to our room was a residential apartment where the tenant had a small dog that barked several times during the night. Enough to wake one up though. Also the pooch barked incessantly for about 10 minutes at 6am which is not what one would expect to experience here.The room was dated but vey comfortable. You definitely have the feeling you are in a private residence. It had a large throw rug over hardwood floors. Some of the moldings were beat up and the grate below the a/c unit was falling off. If you can live with these kind of things than you will be OK. Do not expect a Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental experience with the rooms. The bathroom was marble and full of mirrors, also a bit dated but very clean with fresh orchids in a bud vase. Also the toiletries were all Kiehl's products. That being said the service in the hotel was very good. The staff were very respectful and unobtusive without the slightest bit of attitude. The lobby is a gorgeous art deco throwback to another era with black marble floors that sparkle. Everything seemed very fresh and clean. The restaurant is quite formal and they require jackets at dinner but it too is a gorgeous room with fresh flowers everywhere. There are casual rooms to dine in as well which are adjacent to the restaurant. The hotel bar is also very nice. And the supper club Cafe Carlyle looked very nice. The restaurants and bars seem to have come straight from the 40s. Think ""Stork Club"" ambiance.

The people who expect big rooms to go with their big prices shouldn't have such high expectations in NYC, unless you're staying at The Plaza or rent an apartment. That's just the way it is in this city.However, on arrival, (my partner and I at the time were checking in) we were told that they required a credit card - 'standard practice,' we thought...No.We were subsequently informed that we had not paid. I told them very politely that, yes infact the bill had been covered way beforehand as this was my birthday and we wanted no hassle with the room. Whilst they faffed around behind the desk, we retreated to the seating area very embarrassed and were taken into the bar finaly by an over-compensating manager who told the barman to 'look after us' and said the first round of drinks would be complimetary. No such luck, this was on our bill when we went to check out after our stay.Anyway, this was all sorted out and it turned out they had put a lovely birthday suprise/cake/amenities in our room for me on my father's request so that was something nice to have. However, what I was NOT pleased with was that the reason why our check in had revealed we 'hadn't paid.' Their excuse was that their accounts dept. had not transferred the information that we had actually paid. Thanks. Absolutely ridiculous when you consider it's a 5* hotel.So, among the strangeness was a REALLY loud minibar which we had to turn off every night, some food got taken out of our room that was in a brown bag that you couldn't see into and clearly NOT trash, and after we complained about this, we were given lots of things out of the minibar to have for free but they then appeared on our bill too which we refused to pay for.

All the facilities were exceptionally clean. We got engaged over the weekend. When I made the reservation through Rosewood’s toll free reservations system, they asked me if there was any special occasion for the trip. I mentioned that I was going to get engaged during our stay. The reservations agent replied that that was nice. There was no further discussion of it and I did not make any special requests. Upon check in, the hotel clerk (Michaela) pleasingly welcomed us by name, stated that they had been expecting our arrival and announced that they had a nice upgrade for us to one of the tower rooms with a spectacular view. We were taken up the elevators by one of their elevator attendants, accompanied by a bellman that opened the door to a spacious corner room with a view of southerly view of Madison Avenue on one side and the entire span of Central Park on the other side. There was a chilled bottle of complimentary champagne, complete with rose petals, a handwritten note from the hotel manager, and luscious chocolate covered strawberries, on the hutch. This was the beginning of a wonderful stay in which no detail was overlooked. Every time we left our room or moved about the public spaces, we were greeted by a staff member graciously asking whether we were enjoying our stay and whether there was anything they could do for us.The concierge made a number of excellent recommendations. After we had returned from a disappointing evening at the Rainbow Grill, the concierge, Javier I believe, welcomed us back and escorted us into the bar and made sure we had the most comfortable seat. He congratulated us on our engagement and immediately sent us two complimentary glasses of champagne. We had not told Javier about the engagement and yet, he (and all the other staff members we encountered) was aware of it. Remember, this was all because of the brief exchange I had with the reservations agent at Rosewood. I took advantage of the fitness center which is a temporary room while they renovate and expand their spa and fitness center, which will be complete in September. Even the temporary arrangement was more than satisfactory. Three new Cybex treadmills with attached TV’s and a few Stairmasters and dumbbells. I suspect the new facility will be outstanding. The fitness center has an attendant ready to address any need that may arise during the workout. Finally, we requested a tour of some of the other rooms. Kelly from Guest Services took us on a 15 minute tour of some of the other rooms. All rooms were tastefully and gracefully appointed and all had unique layouts. Kelly was informative, pleasant and welcoming. Like all the other staff, she made us want to stay only as Rosewood properties wherever we go! Regrettably, we did not take any meals in the dining room. It was beautiful and I’ve no doubt the service there is perfect.

They are committed to give you the best time. It’s remembering the best hotels in Europe when we were small and traveling with our parents.The rooms are small if you are staying in the regular rooms, but we’ve have stayed in the most beautiful room as well, that you feel you are a guest in someone's home.I love how they handled the situation when the air conditioner in our room wasn’t cooling very much (very hot summer). They changed our rooms immediately and send us a bottle of wine, followed by a bottle of champagne, and a note to ensure we were happy in our room. The next day a phone call followed by Ms. Hanus, just assuring we where enjoying our stay.So this hotel is for known travelers who enjoy and appreciate the details in a very traditional and sophisticated hotel.

When a celebrity checked in behind us we thought we had made the right choice. also note many famous stars own residences at this hotel so if you sit in the lobby you are guaranteed to see someone. Our feelings changed when we went to or rooms. They were diminutive but doable. However the non-smoking floor smelled like cigarettes. They gave us an air purifier but we still smelled smoke the entire time. Then when my wife stepped on a tooth pick an hour into our stay and had blood gushing out of her foot, the hotel sent an ambulance to our room. They seemed to care but later left. If the room cleaning service would have been five star, this would not have happened. They also wanted to charges us for breakfast even though our plan included it. So after a small talk, they took it off our bill. The concierge didn't know that much and gave us consistently wrong information. The door man was pleasant. The breakfast was very tasty and pleasant as well. Maybe the problem was that all the priests and cardinals of the pope were staying there at the same time. I don't really know.

Obviously it was another time before hotels became luxury properties and standards went up. When we checked in I asked that rollaways be put in the living room of our suite for my two children. They assured me this would be done right away. We went out to dinner and I stopped by the front desk and made the request again, and asked that it be done by the time we returned from dinner. When we returned they were still not there, and I made the request a third time. Finally I had to call a fourth time -- four hours after my original request - and basically tell them I would get better service at a holiday inn before they responded. They said they got the wrong room, filled my room with wine, 3 dozen roses, fruit, and free passes to the madeline tea. We decided to take them up on the offer of a 'free tea' -- easily the worst food and atmosphere (with the exception of beautiful drawings on the walls by the artist who illustrated the madeline books) of any tea in nyc. I would have thought they would have tried hard to make it work! They took forever to wait on us, and then brought us the wrong items. Then they apologized for bringing us the wrong food, and said they would fix it. We left 10 minutes later, still not served correctly. The 'tea' I ordered was inedible. The bed was the most uncomfortable I have stayed on in many years, and the couch in the living room looked like it should be sent to goodwill. When we originally checked in they kept telling us that they upgraded our suite to one with a Steinway grand piano -- needless to say we didn't need that with our 5 and 7 year old. The management bent over backwards to give us a wonderful stay, but the hotel is just way past its prime, and cannot compete with the newer hotels in new york. They were great at making big promises, and bad at execution. For the prices they are charging, I would have expected more.

The service during my entire stay was truly superb, from the front desk to the housekeeper. They are discrete, but warm, and very competent. I find this increasingly rare in hotels and what a joy to find it here. I also disagree with an earlier reviewer, who complained about the manned elevators - I like them, not just for the extra service, but for security. Only complaint is cost of all the small things - I spent a few hundred dollars on bottled water before I realized the price. A simple breakfast ran around $50. The hotel also lacks a spa, which they are now planning. They sent an outside person to my room to do a pedicure - it was just fair, and $150. Ouch.

When my mother and I went for a walk and didn't want to carry the umbrella for the next few blocks, we handed it to the door man, who said that he'd make sure that it'd be in the room. It was.Also, you are welcomed with a platter of fresh fruit, cheese and truffles. Wonderful presentation!Also, the breakfast was awesome. My mother is still talking about hte blueberry muffins. They have a type of crust on the top. The coffee was great too. We stayed at the hotel for about five days; so folks started to know who we were.We also had tea there too. There's a quaint tea room off from the main lobby.I had only a couple of issues:1. I think guests should get a break on paying cover charge at the restaurant/bar. We enjoyed a great jazz performance in the main lounge. 2. The concierge desk was always super busy. They needed more than one person handling things. Also, this isn't a good place to get Broadway tickets. Apparently, if you book it through them, it'll cost you almost three-times the rate. The concierge explained that there is an additional charge for booking tickets through the hotel. We found it easier just to go to the box office and get the tickets ourselves.Also, this hotel is in a super quiet neighborhood. I didn't feel like I was in a city. And the hotel did a wonderful job of making sure that the drapes and the shades were extra thick to block out the sun.Mom and I also walked to the local museums - The Whitney is right in the neighborhood.

I was travelling with my teenage daughter and her friend and they fell in love with the understated luxury of the Carlyle. In fact, they said that if they could live in the beautiful two- bedroom suite we were given on the 27th floor they'd be happy for the rest of their lives! As well as two large bedrooms and three bathrooms, we had a lounge -- complete with baby grand piano-- and a kitchen. The picture window offered the most magnificent panorama of Manhattan's skyline. Each night, it felt as if we were coming home to our own apartment. Such luxury obviously comes at a price -- but this is a hotel steeped in history. John F Kennedy , the Princess of Wales and Mick Jagger are just a few of the legendary names who've been frequent visitors.The Cafe Carlyle is a legend in its own right and the knowledge that Woody Allen often strolls in to play his clarinet with his jazz band is spine tingling!The hotel is on Madison Avenue -- brilliant for walking to some of the smartest shops in town.

I thought the room was fine for this price, however, I understand that normally these rooms go for $600.00 at which point I think I might be upset. Our room although nice, was small, with very little walking room which is not a big deal. Some of the things I had issue with. Room service tacks on a $15.00 surcharge for anything you order. My husband's cheeseburger which initally cost $25.00 ended up costing $40.00. The bar is also quite overpriced. We ordered a vodka tonic which was $18.00. Even by New York standards, that's a bit steep. The TV cable constantly went out. It's rare that it worked properly. An interesting feature of this hotel is that they still have bellmen operating the elevators. Frankly, this is an absurd practice for this hotel because the elevators are very tiny. They comfortably hold about 4 people. The bellmen take up valuable space to perform a needless, if not pretentious, task of pushing buttons. I found riding up and down to the 23rd floor to be a somewhat akward experience with these men who I doubt have any job satisfaction performing this ridiculous function in a claustrophobic space.

They were very kind with making a booking with very little notice.I've written on this website to offer constructive criticism and I will offer when hotels get it right.

The managment sent up a bottle of wine, scrumtious chocolate and grapes as an apology for the last visit. The one down side (sorry guys) is the housekeeping staff just isn't on par with the a $800 night room. Turn down service shouldn't come at 6pm and when they do finally come they shouldn't turn down 1/2 the bed, and I shouldn't have had to call for a second hand towel. In addition, there were no face clothes nor any shower caps. What is it with the service at this hotel? Even if I were paying half that amount for a room I don't want to share a hand towel with my husband and I would expect face clothes. The room service breakfast came exactly on time and was lovely and fresh. One thing I don't understand from our previous visit and this visit. We drove to NYC from our home and valet parked the car with the hotel. When we gave the claim check to the front desk we expected the car to be brought around. We waited for that to happen. Each time we were told to take our bags and walk to the garage and get our car ourselves. This time we had to walk through the hotel laundry being loaded onto trucks to get to the garage. I don't understand if they can take the car from us in the front of the hotel when we arrive, why don't they deliver the car to us when we depart?

This is probably the only hotel left in NYC that still has elevator operators. The service is outstanding and friendly. Bemelman's Bar is a not-to-be-missed experience for anyone who likes classic places. You can sit and watch a lot of fascinating people while you drink your admittedly expensive but excellent cocktails, enjoy the delicious (free) bar snacks and listen to a live pianist playing jazz standards.If you can afford it, get a suite here, as we did (for $805 per night including daily room service breakfast, which wasn't much more than we'd have paid for a standard room at other high-end NYC hotels that weekend). The suites really give you a vintage residental feeling. They are very spacious and nicely decorated in an old money, slightly shabby chic way, with hardwood floors, antique furniture and carpets. The beds are extremely comfortable. It's a bit like staying at a rich aunt's house.Our suite had a tiny kitchenette in addition to the 1 1/2 baths. (I couldn't help but think of Nora ""offering"" to make scrambled eggs -- watch the movies and you'll get the joke.) It is true that the ""master"" bath in our suite was tiny, because the hotel is over 75 years old and they've kept the original architectural footprint. It didn't bother us, since the bathroom was in excellent shape and had been updated with stone tile and a jetted tub.The hotel restaurant is very good and the ""Ladies Who Lunch"" special 2-course menu offered on weekdays is a value at $24.

The first morning, we awoke to jack-hammers and electric drills (one sounded like an airplane engine being tested!). We were moved to a 'quieter' room but awoke the second morning to jack-hammers and drills. When we complained a third time, we were asked to leave the hotel at 1:00 a.m.! Beyond the construction cover-up, the level of service is simply unacceptable for a hotel charing over $600 a night. The shower door wasn't sealed at the bottom, so each shower flooded the tiny bathroom with an inch of water. But, on arrival, there was no bathmat, which might have helped avert the flooding. The Kiehl amenities provided by the hotel were mostly missing when we arrived. The staff supplied them later, but when we partially used the bottles, we discovered that, rather than providing new bottles the staff simply tops them up with tap water! The bathrobes provided were tattered and frayed. The Internet connector cable was broken. Room service is dreadfully slow. The concierge's telephone line is always busy. The doormen were basically missing in action every time we wanted help hailing a taxi (we knew the doormen were around one evening because, unlike before, they had turned on the outside overhead heaters for themselves - not for guests!). The final insult was when we moved rooms: The staff stole from our luggage the box of complimentary chocolates provided by the hotel!

Also, at 7 am after a long and happy night, our doorbell rang. We hadn't ordered or pre-ordered breakfast and there was a PRIVACY sign hanging from the door knob. Nonetheless, my beautiful girlfriend had to put on a robe and confront a phantom room service attendant who, having erred, scurried away. It is bad to be picky about such a fine hotel, but as its fineness is so contingent on the perfection of little things, I have no choice but to mention the above.

We met up with some friends that live near the hotel and my girlfriend and I decided to browse and shop at the fashionable and excellent Madison Avenue boutiques and dined at Nello's on Madison Avenue. We returned to the hotel and to our amazement in the lobby there stood Warren Beatty, Annette Benning and their children chating with Jack Nicholsen. In all my years of traveling have I ever come across that level of celebrity in a hotel all in one place. The Carlyle is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, the premier room that we booked is more like a suite in a home, rather than a hotel. I got one of the best nights sleep as the bed engulfs you with beautiful linens and comfort. I have to find out who they use as a florist, as the lobby and restaurant had the most breathtaking floral arrangements that I've ever seen. The lobby in the evening takes on a mystical and magical feeling with the soft lighting on the flowers, oil paintings and beautiful chandeliers. Before we went out for dinner we decided to have a drink at Bemelmans bar - I wish our children was with us as I've been reading Madeline books to our little girl and she would have been very excited to see the drawings on the wall of Madelines journies through Central Park and her adventures with her schoolmates. The next time we book a weekend in New York we will be sure to bring back our children so that we can enlighten them on the museums and culture that this property surrounds you with.

What a great experience! I have always heard the ""legend of the Carlyle"" but did not expend to fall under it's spell while I was there. I travel ALOT so I have seen it all! The lobby was beautiful! I arrived at night and there were candles lit. It looked so beautiful against the black marble, with the crystal chandelier and the silver theme throughout! I was stunned! The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming. Knowing I had a long trip and must be tired and hungry they offered to have room service sent up. Telling the kind staff that I was just too tired they asked if i needed a wake up call, or perhaps coffee sent up at a particular time in the morning! Oh wouldn't that be perfect! I admit I have become addicted to my programable coffee maker! Visiting how tired I am at this point, they quckly checked me in and explained the hotel's key points, and rang for a bellman! RANG! An actual bell! How, I want to say quaint, but that sounds negative, it was just pleasantly unique! The bellman (whom I learned later in my stay has worked there for decades!) escorted me up and shared a few more stories about the hotels history, he got me all situated in my room and wished me a sound sleep! The whole process from the doorman with umbrella to shield me from the wrath of mother nature to there luxurious linens in front of the flat screen plasma TV wil about 2000 channels, took about a cool 5 minutes! That was it! I have fallen under their spell! The dream continued through the rest of the stay!My wakeup call in the morning with a friendly voice telling me of the days weather, and my coffee quickly followed. Thank god! As I thought about the days ahead I stopped at the concierge for suggestions. We talked about some shows and restaurants that would be great. I went to the marvelous breakfast buffet (try the cheeses!) and the staff again was mighty attentive! I went to walk in central park, i could not believe it was right there! On my out, the concierge had seen me and mentioned that the tickets and restaurant reservations were all set!Everything just fell into place. That is until the night before I was checking out. I realized I had forgotten all my chargers. My cell phone was already dead and my IPOD was hanging on for dear life! I called the front desk to see if perchance one of the staff had my same phone and happened to bring their charger along to work. I was in luck! They have a varied supply! Now to solve the IPOD issue. My biggest nightmare, and 8 hours of a airtime, borken up only by a four hour layover, with no tunes!!! Then as I'm about to hang up the phone I give it a shot and ask the agent on the phone if they have a charger. The voice on the other end mentions that there is an IPOD docking station in the room. REALY? Then I see that on the other side of the giant bed (which I need to get me one for home, its heaven!) there IS a docking station on the end table! So I hooked up my NANO, hit play and listend to the tunes while I solemly packed for my departure from this haven in the city! I miss the Carlyle, the staff and FOOD already! I was there for such a short time, but I felt as if I have been going there my entire life. By the time I left, the staff recognized my by name and wished me a ""safe journey!""

I write regarding our most recent stay, in May, 2006, but my comments also relate, generally, to the entirety of our visits.The Carlyle is about continuity. It is about service, and graciousness. It is not trendy. It does not have a flashy lobby or public spaces. With The Carlyle you get the same bell staff, the same elevator operators, the same doormen and the same room service attendants, year in and year out. You get a warm smile that you reasonably can believe is meant for you. The service at The Carlyle is exemplary. I can’t think of a request that has not been honored, and I can’t think of a case where housekeeping service did other than a terrific job. Room service is on time and bell staff prompt.We have always stayed in inside suites (the Standard and Superior category of one bedroom suites). That means a view towards Park Avenue (beware, the very low floor inside suites just look into the adjoining buildings). It also means quiet – no street noise, no noise from adjoining rooms. The suites are well-appointed, with a nice size living room (with a desk, a comfortable couch and two comfortable easy chairs). The bedrooms have always had a easy chair, with a reading light. The linens and bedding are of first quality. I’m picky about hotel lighting, and The Carlyle always passes the test – every seating area is well-lit enough for reading. The furnishings are in classic good taste.The HVAC units (the suites have separate controls for the bedroom and the living room) are efficient and quiet.The suites usually have a full bath and one half bath. The full bath is small. I understand that plans are afoot to convert some of the walk-in closets (some of the suites have two) into bathroom space. Until then, don’t expect much space in the bathrooms.Breakfasts at The Carlyle are adequate. The buffet is not extensive – although what is there is well prepared. I’ve always had good service at breakfast (although until Rosewood took over management, I’m not sure that some of the head waiters at breakfast had smiled in some time). If breakfast is included in your room rate, eat at the hotel. If it isn’t, I’d eat breakfast somewhere else.The Carlyle’s rack rates are high. I have almost always been able to obtain, through one affiliation or another, a price break on those rates. I’m already booked for a return visit to The Carlyle. It’s home for me in New York.","New Albany, Ohio","OrrvilleRedRider</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Albany, Ohio</strong>",432,5.0

If you liked hotels with an old-world charm, this may well be your favorite hotel.The lobby is very tasteful, with a style that appeals to all generations. The ""classical influence"" really begins at the elevators, which are still manned by elevator operators. Frankly, I find that a bit pretentious and unneccessary. Why demand extra labor when there's no need for it? There's a difference between excellent service and excessive service. And in the context of the Carlyle's elevator operators, this is debatable.With my lowly corporate rate, I had a standard room on the 19th floor. I understand that the hotel prides itself on history, so I won't be overly critical about the wear-and-tear of the furnishings and finishes. My overall impression of the room was warm, tasteful and intimate. It felt like a private residence rather than a hotel. However, rooms are on the small side compared to Four Seasons and Ritz Central Park.You should have realized by now that I'm not a big fan of classical hotels. I didn't like the Plaza (back in the good old days) or Waldorf. But I enjoyed the Carlyle because of its service. I don't know whether it is the fact that 80% of the staff speaks with a French accent or the general professionalism, but I felt that the Carlyle's service is very personal. And that, may I add, is very different from the service you get at chains like Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton. It makes the hotel a home for its guests.If I were to pay $600 for a standard room, where would I stay? I have to admit that Carlyle would not be on the top of my list.

This bar, named for Madeline author Ludwid Bemelman, is intrinsically very nice and in some ways is an upper Eastt Side neighborhood watering hole. One nite featured Chris Gillespie, who is a most expert musician, but he was accompanied by a jazz ensemble which is much to loud for the size of the bar. In addition to that, the management wants $20.00/per cover charge for hotel guests. When I complained, they waived the cover, but the ensemble was so loud as to be irritating. Saturday nite there were so many non-Carlyle people in the bar that we over to the Pierre and listened to quiet music with no cover.

I don't think the youngish staff is used to handling ""package"" guests.Also: no coffee makers or ironing boards in the rooms, but what can I say? Their typical clientele has staff for such things.Still: check the website for good package offers.",Wisconsin,"Mme_X</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wisconsin</strong>",523,5.0

Serivce like I have never seen anywhere else in the world, except maybe the Four Seasons Clift in San Francisco.(and that was in 1991) My stay was is October, 2003. Food, concierge, beds!!!, real furniture, Six--count em 6 windows with real views in New York City!!!! Impeccably decorated!!! Old fashioned but yet modern.The staff literally takes care of your every need. The concierge rents the movies your kids want from a video store on Madison Ave. and brings it to your room. When you check in and out three or four bellmen rush your luggage to the taxi waiting for you outside the main entrance on 76th St.The neigborhood is very safe(almost like a small town) and the hotel has a feeling of being at home. It is so remarkable, you actually forget that you are in New York City!","Tampa, Florida","gbsesq</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",10,5.0

The housekeeping know your preferences. Bar and restaurant are overpriced but nice and good. The management and the the concierge team are world class. The rooms are spacious, for the conditions of New York they are really huge. But the air condition is very loud and the rooms need a renovation.","Stuttgart, Germany","GrandTour24825</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stuttgart, Germany</strong>",13,4.0

It is elegant but friendly and the service is the best that I have seen anywhere. The Carlyle gives you the the elegance of a gone by era with all the modern touches. The staff know who you are and after a day or so the place really feels like home. --if only it could be. The food is superb. The best part of any visit to NYC.
