The main draw back is that it isn't very walkable to restaurants and other tourist/traveler activities.

Next to metro line and walking distance to Odaiba and other areas. Seems like a newer hotel and rooms are stylish including bathroom with soaking tub. Stayed in floor 9, standard double bed room. Decent view. Things to note: Small rooms, charged xtra fee if check-in before 2pm, breakfast is buffet only - can’t go for just coffee without having to pay $20/ 2000 yen, cost of buffet even if you’re not actually eating. Thin walls. Hard bed. Good budget stay.",,TeaWineSuzhiPizza,1,3.0

The hotel is situated outside the city center. Although it is well connected to public transportation, the location is not ideal for those looking to do a lot of sightseeing. For example, getting to Asakusa District via subway lines will take approximately 1 hour (one way). This hotel is not recommended for tourists who are easily confused with navigation especially in Tokyo. It is however a very clean and capable hotel. In my opinion, the hotel is more suited for individuals who are engaged in business in the area. The rooms are small but adequate in amenities. Most importantly, it is clean. The hotel has automated laundry washers/dryers and the washing/drying progress can be monitored in your room TV. The breakfast buffet was adequate. However, the hotel cannot accommodate a large group and will therefore separate groups in another location (same level as reception). There were no issues with checking in and out. There is an automated check out kiosk which has several languages. You simply follow the instructions on screen and deposit the room key cards.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","SouthPhillyPT19148</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",119,3.0

It's again part of the Daiwa Roynet Hotel-Group. The hotel and the rooms are very nice and the rooms are not small as expected in Japan. Also the bed was confortable. But for Sightseeing i would maybe not choose this hotel again, you maybe have two stations just at your side, but there are no direct connection to JR-Line or Tokyo-Metro. So if you wanna stay in Daiba this hotel is perfect but for visiting other places in Tokyo it's a litte bit more difficult to get around.","Siebnen, Switzerland","TheTraveller_247</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Siebnen, Switzerland</strong>",2582,4.0

It’s not that close to the main part of shinjuku (20 minutes walk), but I would have been ok with that if not for other problems. The mattress is the hardest I have felt in my life. Not exaggerating. It’s almost like sleeping on the ground. They also nickel and dime you for everything. 1000 yen per hour for a late checkout, 400 yen to call a taxi (never have I heard of this last one at a hotel and especially not in Japan). Rooms are extremely tiny. I made sure to get a larger twin room even though I’m just one person because I needed space to pack. Of course there’s none and the suitcase barely opens in the space provided. Please don’t make the same mistake I did. Stay somewhere else. I have no idea where the positive reviews are coming from.

The room comes with a sizable massage chair and a nice sized tv for your viewing pleasure. A mini-fridge and humidifier are at your disposal along with a safe, iron and steamer for trousers. The bathroom/shower facilities provides you with the necessary amenities, and the tv can show you the status of the washer/dryers in the laundry room if you need to plan any wash (detergent is provided by the machines).The biggest surprise I found was a complimentary smartphone in the room. With it, you had access to the web, make free local and international calls (depending on country), and you could take it along with you in your travels for directions, tips, photos & such. I did not use it as I already purchased a data simm for my phone, but it's nice to know I have the option for my next trip. The phone is programmed to erase your data on checkout, but there is a manual feature to do the same.I did not try the restaurants, but a convenience store is available 24/7.Overall, I give this hotel a thumbs up.","Norristown, Pennsylvania, United States","rfraser999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norristown, Pennsylvania, United States</strong>",3,5.0
