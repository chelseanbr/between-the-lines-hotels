The location of the hotel is nice if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle and nightlife of the main strip of Waikiki. Waikiki Monarch is a family friendly hotel with a pool, hot tub, laundry facilities, dining options, a bar, and car rental on site. It’s a short walk to the beach or lagoon which is very good he have small children swim. From my understanding the hotel is under some renovations so my room was newer and more updated. The housekeeping was not the best. There where bits of broken glass in the entry of the room and some potato chip crumbs in the seating area. My sons room had partial renovations just yet we had to have maintenance come in and do a minor repair while we were there. Day two the entire bank of elevators was down for maintenance for a couple of hours. I realize maintenance has to be done, don’t know if there was a way around shutting down all the elevators for the hotel side at one time?Not sure what the deal is with the key cards for this hotel we had to have our key cards programmed multiple times within a short five days day didn’t matter which room other guess were experiencing the same problem I think maybe they need to upgrade that system from my understanding it’s a huge problem. Finally, it seems as though the alarm system for the adjoining condominium complex is linked to the hotel and an entire evacuation was call at 11:42pm it seemed chaotic we finally were informed that it was a false alarm by word of mouth nothing official. I can tell the staff is truly concerned about making the customer experience better I’ll probably give it another try in another year or two and see if they’ve managed to pull everything together right now I can only offer 2 1/2 to 3 stars.

They also charge you $12 a day per person for the hotel amenities which I think included a gym that we didn’t even touch but were charged for it anyways. The rooms at this place are tiny. The beds are old and squeaky. When you’re getting to and from the rooms from the lobby there’s signs warning about an update the the fire alarm ( doesn’t say when) and a warning about ants in your room. Not very appetizing. We had a non smoking room but through the vents somehow are room wreaked of cigarette smoke. The pool here is decent but the jacuzzi needed some attention. The AC unit in our room looked like it was being held up by some napkin of sorts. There was only ONE plug in in the room to charge electronics. That was very inconvenient. It appeared that although both the hotel and Airbnb were located in the same place, the pricing for amenities was different which made no sense. This hotel is very old. I definitely recommend spending more money to stay at one of the nicer hotels down the block.",,GlobeTrotting822945,1,1.0

From our room on the 34th floor we had a view of the ocean. It was walking distance to the beach and close to an early morning breakfast location. The apt offered everything that we needed. It was clean, the bed was very comfortable, shower was good and there was plenty of hot water. The previous guests had left shampoo / dish detergent etc all of which we were expecting to have to buy. We shall do the same.The big downside was with the second bedroom. The slats in the blinds were missing so definitely should be replaced. The window A /C blew directly into your face as one tried to sleep, which resulted in having to turn it off at night, the bed should be moved to the opposite wall otherwise having A/C in that room is useless. It is also stuck at one temperature, so can't be regulated.Three of the lights were not working, again a maintenance issue.We were paying $400 CAD per night ( $200 CAD per night per couple ) so quite expensive especially if it were two adults with children. At those prices it would have been great if the maintenance people had at least checked that everything was in working order before each new guest came in.As we only used the rooms for sleeping in it didn't really spoil our holiday, but if one was cooking and spending a lot of time there it would definitely have been an issue.","Ottawa, Canada","casefam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",46,3.0

I booked a queen bed with bathtub on my work credit card. Upon arrival, we couldn't park in the lot because we needed a room key to get the low rate (of a steep $25/day!). My partner waited in the car, parked illegally, while I checked in. I was told i needed to provide another card to charge because I didn't physically have the work credit card, and that work could ""just pay you back"", which is not terribly convenient. I travel for work several times a month and have never had this issue. After we went through the process, I was told ""I got you a good bed"", just to finally park and crawl up 18 floors to find out we had two full sized beds and no bathtub. We were too afraid to have to go in and out of the parking garage again so we ordered dinner through a delivery service (awesome!) and stopped by the little bodega in the lobby (fine, nice guy). We tried to take showers but had no hot water. Ww tried to watch TV, and could only watch someone's Netflix account that was signed into the Roku TV because the antenna wouldn't hold long enough to watch anything local. We tried to find the pool, and found a hot tub. Excited, we jumped in....to a hot pool of foul-smelling human urine. No joke. It was just steamy urine with broken buttons and flashing lights. Back to our room to cool down in our cold shower (the soap smelled really lovely though) and tried to sleep. Unfortunately, the entire time, day or night, it sounds like chihuahuas driving tiny slick track go carts while a murder of crows cheers them on.

Front desk help very friendly and helpful! The rooms are okay for the price, and Security was on it. Our first day experience was absolutely great! But here is where we went from great to a not so great experience. On our second day we decided to go to the pool. It was windy out but my babies still wanted to swim. So we spent the day there. We got to the pool at about 1pm on Monday 3/19/18. The wind was whipping around the building. Knowing that the wind will blow all our clothes, cups, plates, food, napkins off the table we lifted the table and placed it behind a wall that was blocking the wind. It was a perfect spot on the pool deck! Our things didn't fly and we were in perfect eye view of our children swimming. It was such a perfect day, until about 4pm ( 3 hours later) when Security advised us that we needed to move the table back to it's original location. I asked him if we can move it back when we are done. I'll make sure of it. He said no it's the rules and we can't see you folks on our cameras. So we did and the wind started to blow our things off the table. I read the pool deck rules and there was no mention of it. I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager to see if the manager would kindly make a minor accommodation by letting us place the table where we were. I was able to talk to the Manager on the phone and asked if she would accommodate us. She explained Security is separate from them and they follow the pool rules. I explained that the pool rules does not mention anything about the moving the table or furniture. She said they follow the AOAO rules. I said okay I didn't get a copy of the AOAO rules when I checked in. She said yes it's their rules. I said okay so it's a rule that I can't see. She said yes and you can be written up for it. I was like written up OMG... LOL!!! I'm a customer here how am I going to get written up... LOL!!! I said you know what that's okay. I went back up to the pool with my family. Not even 15 minutes later a Asian couple dragged....the table and bench along the pool deck floor, and placed it along side the building wall. To not get the couple in trouble, we explained to them that Security will tell them to move the table and bench back. The Asian couple said no it's windy and it'll blow our things. I laughed and said that's what we said, and Security made us move it back. Few minutes after Security came up saw the Asian couple, went over to them, had small chat, and walked away without advising them or telling them to move the table back. I just shook my head and laughed. At that moment I was blown back! I was like what is the difference. Why is it okay for them and not for us. I felt discriminated against. We ended our day and went back to our room. Later that evening my wife goes down to the street sidewalk to smoke a cigarette clearly more than 20 feet away from every entrance, exit, ventilation, and window and Security advised her that she needed to go further around the corner or across the street. At that point I felt like we were being targeted. For what I don't know. They enforced a rule that I can't see, and enforced a smoking law that my wife was clearly in compliance with.... LOL!!! OMG! They have signs that says ""no smoking within 25 feet"" which is no big deal, but if you going to enforce it make sure it's following State regulations, and if you're going to enforce rules make sure it's readily available or visible so folks don't think they are being discriminated against or bullied.

No major renos in the past 30+ years-Thin Thin walls, keeper down..-Drapery, sinks, and showers have major stains. I mean BLACK!-Elevators tend to open 4-6 inches above or below your floor, key card to operate can be clumsy especially after a long night out..- This is a hotel/Air BnB, condo, rent by the hour? I dunno... sketchy people live here. Lots of fighting going on -AC units dated, turning on and off every 5 mins- Room service will not clean your coffee maker, this became the running joke-Front desk staff is very hit or miss-Wifi doesn't exist, you are told it works only in the lobby, my experience the network didn't even show up in the lobby-hidden fees, AKA the gym..-lots of foot traffic in halls (plumbers, electricians, extermination) etc water was off 11-3 monday to friday though not a problem for usPros:-Location Location Location. 5 min walk to everything. beach, shopping, eats, bars, transportation for those single male travelers, close to strip joints if you are into that...-Depending on your room Awesome views-Linens were clean and soft-Parking on site ($25 daily)-Pubs and restaurants on location (never tried them though)-Beautiful pool deck, shallow pool (6feet)-Laundry on site-lowest ""BRT tax"" of any hotel I found $10.47 dailyWould I stay here again?

It was near impossible get anything done in the small space. The hot tub was cold all week, the treadmill in the gym stopped working and didn't get repaired all week, the remote control was dead, the plug-in on the wall, in our room wouldn't charge our phones. When we arrived, we had a plugged toilet and were handed a plunger to look after it ourselves as the maintenance staff had gone home. (This was around 5:30pm) We were told to plunge it ourselves or move rooms. This is after we just unpacked all our things. Vanessa, the manager is not focused on customers. She suggested we leave when we shared our disappointments. We agreed we would find alternative accommodations, but then she indicated she would charge us anyway because we didn't give her 72 hours notice of our departure. Although I had a hard copy of a printed confirmation on the pricing of the hotel in my room, we were charge a higher rate and were not allowed up to our room until we paid the higher rate. Once I returned to the front desk to show the proof of charges on our confirmation, the staff would not refund our money. We had to deal with Vanessa (the manager) the next morning. She then indicated she had to check with her staff. It was a total ""gong show"" that finally ended in my insisting that the rate on my confirmation letter be honored. Vanessa would then not agree to cancel a second reservation I had made for my children coming in from Canada for a week. She said I had to go online and cancel. So I went to the business office and online, instructions indicated to phone a number, (which was the front desk-Christine) so I walked from the business office to the front desk while on my cell phone to cancel the reservation.

But I think I'd pay the extra to stay closer.I don't think I'd stay again nor recommend it. The extremely poor service from majority of the staff (except Jeremiah) the terrible Wi-Fi and distance from everything just makes this kind of a pointless place to stay. It doesn't feel Hawaiian and doesn't put you close enough to really justify being ""in"" Waikiki.As my title says, it did its job but I'd never come back sorry.",,Tylor H,6,3.0

It was cost prohibitive for me to book 2 hotel rooms at the Convention hotels.So we looked at various alternatives and found this location through Airbnb - a first for us.After reading all the reviews, mapping its location and proximity to the Hawaiian Convention Center, we settled on this location.Our flight arrived near midnight local time after having left the East coast around noon. We finally got to our condo, exhausted and tired. The ride from the airport was about 20 minutes. We got our keys and decided to park our car. We were surprised to learn that parking was $25/day - CASH for guests, payable upfront. Fortunately, we were able to muster some cash and pay in advance for the next several days and parked our car. We then proceeded to check into our condo. The entrance to our condo led us to 2 doors, each leading to an individual room/unit.The rooms were modest, each with a queen bed and individual bathrooms. They each had a tiny kitchenette, refrigerator and sink.We crashed and slept for a few hours to wake up to brilliant sunshine and spectacular views. The rooms were average, and the bathrooms really needed an upgrade with metal streaks in the bathtub and caulk falling off from various areas.I somewhat knew this but was surprised to how shoddy it was. But, we were not staying here for the amenities but rather the location and lower cost. It was in Waikiki, near the other big hotels, convention center and the beach - all within a 10-15 minute walk. And I feel, this is where this hotel/condo delivered. We had a great time and I do not recall anyone one ever complaining about the hotel or their room. We were able to get out every day and do what we wanted. Several chain stores like 7-11 and ABC are nearby for any amenities you may need and the the prices were comparable to the mainland.Overall, I would say, our stay was a pleasant one.","Midlothian, Virginia","kidzdad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Midlothian, Virginia</strong>",75,3.0

In fact, he's the opposite. In his very monotone and unenthusiastic voice with his blank facial expression, he checked me in. Actually, it was a painful process that doesn't blend in well with the Aloha spirit.I did like his unique ""Bowl"" style haircut. When I got into my room, it seemed okay at first glance but when I continued to settle in and unpack, I started to notice the unpleasant details.The rug. It's in many shades of green. Green mildew. Green stains. Green mold. Faded green to yellow patches from possible stain washes in the last several years.The furniture looks like items you may find on the street side walks to be repurposed to use as new furniture. Even the small refrigerator sits on the floor by the entrance door (#ghetto) - which makes it difficult to open and close the fridge.There's no wifi in the rooms but there is wifi in the laundry room.The hotel charges a $10.00 per day ""resort fee"", you would think they can work in a way for wifi.[Small note: just a heads up, the swimming pool is a salt water pool]The second desk person I met there was a young woman who was very charming and engaging. We chatted and she had a very nice disposition. I had asked about extending my stay to a later check out. She told me to call the front desk in the morning of check out.I called and recognized her voice, she told me the hotel was fully booked and I couldn't have my late check out.Well, I was a little sad but then, that sadness turned into being upset when I logged into Orbitz Com and discovered there were rooms available when I was told it wasn't.I don't like liars.My trip wasn't horrible, I spent most of my time with friends and family.Finally, when I checked out, there were 4 people behind the front desk. I stood there for a minute. Finally, with no greeting, I was asked, ""do you need help?"" I looked at all four them and thought, no wonder this hotel is a slum. They don't have the right people working here.I hope by reading this you'll find something else on our beautiful island as better accommodations.If you're young and don't care - this is the place for you.","Las Vegas, Nevada","ryozsun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",50,1.0

I had stayed here a while ago and gave it an unfavorable rating. I now give it a ""terrible"" rating. I would not advise this hotel for anyone traveling with family. I'm a large guy but even I felt a bit uneasy walking through the lobby during evening hours and, heaven forbids, early morning. After my function I checked out the bar in the lower level of the hotel for a night cap and quickly made an ""about face"". Looking in, the people there were sketchy and a local dude at the front suggested that I not go in(?). Had an early flight so I checked out at 4;30 am. It seems that all the drunken low-budget Waikiki party goers (two dozen or so) congregate in the front of the hotel waiting for the bus(?). Some were still drinking alcohol! Now about the hotel. I would rate my room ""fair"" but my bath tub ""horrific""! It was terribly discolored (stained) and filthy. I wore my slippers (flip flops) when I showered and I still felt yucky!!!!!! Didn't want to touch anything in the bathroom, especially the tub. Logistically, nothing is really in easy walking distance of the hotel except for a few convenience stores and a burger/pub across the street. Beyond that, it's a 20 - 30 minute walk to anything of interest. Waikiki Beach, I'm guessing, is a 30 - 45 minute walk away. Parking is a joke. If you're staying at the hotel, it's $25 a day. Parking is limited so I saw the attendant telling numerous hotel guests that the lot was full but they could ""double park"" if they wished?????????? I was extremely fortunate to find on street parking so I was free of this debacle. On my previous review, I mentioned nearby pay parking lots that were more affordable. These, however, were closed and fenced off. Check-in was a joke and you get charged an additional fee upon check-in. Don't know what the fee was for since I paid additional fees on-line. I think it was called a ""convenience fee"" but I could be wrong. Long story short, I would only suggest staying here if you are extremely short of funds and only need a place to sleep. Keep away if bringing your family and loved ones. This was my second stay at this hotel and my last.","Hilo, Hawaii","damookie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilo, Hawaii</strong>",100,1.0

Elevators are not well marked (one side services the hotel and the other services the condos).3. Smaller than average room size.4. Poor water pressure (shower).5. Parking garage is not owned by the hotel, so you can't charge it to your room. Parking is $25.00 for 24 hours. Cash only.6. There is no balcony and the only window seemed to been sealed shut.7. The mini fridge had a big crack in the door insulation, so even with the temperature set to max, it wasn't very cold.8. WiFi available only in the lobby and laundry room (cost included in amenities fee).OTHER POINTS:1. Bring toiletries, even if you're only staying overnight because there's just one small, thin bar soap for both hand and body washing.2. Pack or buy pool towels. There are none available at the pool, but you can check out a regular bath towel from the front desk (if available).We only stayed for 3 nights, so none of the above ""cons"" were crucial enough for us to complain to management about and overall, we did enjoy our stay and would return again.","Koloa, Hawaii","Dizol_Ohana</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Koloa, Hawaii</strong>",4,3.0

The rooms are Motel quality, not hotel. I stayed there 3 nights as part of a solo business trip. I was in room 2302 on the 23rd floor. I am not a picky person and living here locally only needed a place to sleep and wash up, but this place was even below these basic requirements. They are not cleaning the rooms properly. There was foreign hair on my shower wall upon arrival, and the same hair was there throughout my stay. Also, I had dinner on the table provided in the room and there were crumbs left over. The next day the crumbs were still there which tells me they did not wipe the table, or clean the shower. The walls are REALLY thin. You can hear the next room conversation, so it is NOT the place for a ""romantic"" getaway. The AC in the room is really LOUD. And if you turn it off, the room gets hot and stuffy really fast. I had to turn the TV up just to hear it, but outside the room I could hear my TV clearly in the hallway which made me uncomfortable to think I was disturbing others although I could barely hear it in my room. The boxspring had brown stains on it and I was scared to walk barefoot on the faded green dingy musty carpet. You will need to use your room key to ride the elevator up, and after the first day, my card refused to work to take me back up to the 23rd floor. The receptionist acted like they couldn't do anything about it saying it should still work for my room door, but never expressed how I was going to get up there? I had problems with this a few times. Sometimes it never gave me the green light and I had to ask others to use there card to push my number. It is embarrassing to be on an elevator with my card flashing yellow holding up other people. You will have to pay extra to use the gym and the safe in your room. The only thing going for this hotel is the price is one of the lowest you will find in the area, its location, a pool, and the city view I had from my room.

Ultimately you could walk anywhere in 15-20 minutes in Waikiki & there is plenty of public transportation. The rooms were pretty bad. They're musty, stained, & just don't appear to be cared for. The hotel houses regular residents & there is a bar in the lower level that appear to bring in a rough crowd. I stopped by on my way in one night & was literally offered heroin. The staff wasn't overwhelmingly friendly, but I didn't need them for anything so could care less. The take out restaurant & conveinent store in the main lobby were nice to have. I'd say if it's all you can afford--do it. Waikiki is a great experience. If you can swing a couple hundred more (depending on the length of your stay of course), I'd definitely do that.

I was pleasantly surprised with our experience here at this hotel and so was my daughter who has travelled worldwide and stayed well in excess of 100 + hotels across the world. I say with honesty, this place is not the Ritz but if you want that, you can go and pay the price elsewhere. Beds were very comfortable; room was clean with no musty smells present. The room was of sufficient size given it had two double beds in it and we did not feel cramped. The inclusion of a microwave was great. Despite there being a bar under the building, it did not interfere in our stay at all, there was no excess noise and no interference by others during our stay from the rooms adjacent. Any people we saw within the building, permanent residents or guests were pleasant. Staff were friendly, probably just a little quietly serious but still friendly. The surrounding area is very close to ABC stores to buy necessities and a pleasant walk of about 10-15mins to Waikiki Beach. I have read other reviews stating the location of this hotel had lots of emergency sirens going off all the time, but I think this had nothing to do with the hotel itself or surrounding area. During my stay in Oahu, we also stayed at another hotel in the southern Waikiki area and there was often emergency sirens going off down there too so I think this is just what goes on in Waikiki due to the amount of people and busyness of such a popular area. The hotels wifi was great, but unfortunately was only available in the lobby. The addition of more comfortable seating in the lobby would significantly improve guests’ experience, given that they cannot access wifi freely within the privacy and comfort of their room.

Unfortunately no early check-in was available for us.Only 2/3 elevator was working (with the 3rd looking like it had not been working for quite some time).

The toilet was extremely cramped, and old as well however it all worked properly at the very least thankfully. Air-con is of the old kind, being a loud dusty box situated in the window. The room however provides microwave, an appliance that a few higher end hotels have failed to provide.The free wi-fi is misleading as it is actually only available in the lobby which is a frustrating as like I said, there is only about 5 chairs to sit down upon. You will find many residents sitting hours on end using the wifi and taking up the available chairs.There are a few restaurants/shops located in the hotel but absolutely nothing worth noting. There is also a rental car booth available.The location of the hotel itself is outside of the main hub of the Waikiki strip however I suppose if you're up for the walking, it is not such an unreasonable distance.Overall an extremely underwhelming stay, not a hotel that I would return to even for the price I paid which wasn't exactly 'budget' either. If they could update the wifi so that it was available in-room, then that could've made a huge difference to our stay.","Sydney, Australia","Hai T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",8,2.0

Parking- Parking attendent lady yelled at people like i read in other reveiws, but I thought that was just something rude from the driver. Fees looked high, also there is parking validation if you want to come eat at the restaurant there, which is pretty good food, for a high price again. Laundry-First time i try to do laundry here I get harrassed by a woman bugging me about the laundry credit card use not working for her. I said call the number for the laundry company/maintenence, but she kept going on and on. I just kept saying uh huh, yea, etc and finally I left. Pest Control- Innefective. They come every few month, claiming natural pest control that works. Then came the roaches, nothing when i first moved in, but then black biting roaches one after the next. I had to get a roach hotel, spending money out of my own pocket, and that has helped the problem a bit. $Building Water access/Cleanliness- At this point I thought ok, this isnt too bad, after all i should expect some problems. Then when I went to do laundry a 2nd time, I was seeing signs that the building shuts off water twice a month, AND it affects hot water in the laundry room as well. I also noticed that the new machines were very dusty behind them in the maze of pipes, looks like it had never been cleaned. Window slats upon a closer look were broken, and it is above the smoking area as well, so i was getting all that while trying to do my laundry on the 5th Floor.Pool & Clientele: On my way up the stairs from the 5th floor, the only way to access the pool from the condos, I encounter a very slow disabled woman in a walker trying to open the pool door. She wanted me to hold the door for her but took her several minutes to walk through the open door. I thought maybe she should relocate to a older folks home or more accessible single story complex? When you come in there is a very large cemented floor area for the very tiny pool. No shade, grill area and hot tub are there but have never seen anyone use them. The surprise here was the supposedly nude tanning area behind cement slabs which i thought was somewhat odd at a hotel. Hotel Policies- Inconsistent. After living there awile I found that pool hours posted in elevator seem to change each week from 9pm closing to 10pm the next week, to 11pm the next week, then back to 9pm another week. Quiet hours must need to be constantly adjusted here to suit someone's needs? Also there are signs in there always saying not to feed the birds. I noticed there was no notice about real more relevant issues like smoking in the building, even though smoke in the elevator, bars present downstairs, and people smoking very close to the building under the roof area when it rains too, coming right into the lobby and elevator area sometimes. Mail- area smelled like fish and smokey also most of the time. Security takes packages that wont fit in the package boxes. They will not notify you that you have recieved a package, and if you call them, sometimes they cannot find your package or will tell you that you have not recieved any. Only upside to this was calling the company to say i never recieved my package and then finally getting security to give me both packages when they finally ""discover"" it. Phonebooks when delivered are just thrown in a pile on the ground under the mailboxes. Outgoing mailbox is convenient with small slot. Post office is pretty far if you need to pick up a package from them though, but not something bad about the building there.People - Lots of budget tourists, many people from outside of usa, mainly europe, exciting to meet lots of different young people and people from asia as well. Nighttime gets the bar crowd, police showing up and that kinda thing. Probably a safety issue and bars should be relocated elsewhere, not in the hotel, or atleast not on the ground floor with uncontrolled access. Smoking area needs to be designated AWAY from the building entrance areas, on the ala wai side, rather than outside the hotel entrance and then another outside the condo entrance. Security- Mixed. I like most of the people that work in security and have talked with many of them, very nice people. The problem is that I dont feel safe here. Elevators are breaking down regularly and people must use the steps. Often times there is no one at the security desk after hours. Fire department at building several times in the few months ive lived here. Steps are unsafe, very narrow stone steps, especially if you live higher up in the bulding. Very narrow space too going up the steps. Building has almost 40 floors. Would be very scary having to evacuate the building in such a small staircase too. Building is old, built in 1979, unsure if there is asbestos in the popcorn cielings, but I would assume there is. Most of the building has a musty odor to it. Cigarette smoke odors coming from my bathroom and power outlets made me think it could be a fire or other issue in the building if they drop thier cigarette while sleeping or something. I could wake up to a fire. Plumbing - Bad. First week I moved in my toilet clogged up, and could not plunge it. I thought that was strange considering I used only regular toilet paper and nothing else. Then had to turn off the water as it started overflowing/kept running the water. Called maintenence/security. Got a few towels wet. Then the toilet started bubbling, and I called again, this time the Bathtub had a sewage backup in it! Then had to call security, landlord, and Landlord ddint want to call a plumber but finally did. Plumber came and cracked the tub with the machine, and sprayed sewage on the walls etc, and then had to do same thing under the sink. Could have mentioned to take stuff out of the sink drawers as well because that was also spattered a bit. Landlord did not pay for cleanup of the mess left behind, even though I do think was legally responsible for. Front desk guy was helpful when i needed to use the phone, as my cell phone was broken at the time. The lady there was rude afterwards though, telling me to use a payphone. I told her that if if cant call that the hotel may get raw sewage backed up into the elevators and other floors. She quickly let me use the phone after that. Landlord/Owner- Nice at first but then decided they only want to fix certain things but not others with the apartment. Also they tried to tell me that nothing was wrong and not to call them when things break etc. I thought that was very rude and inconsiderate and not doing thier job at all. Needless to say things did get fixed after having to call them several times and follow up double time on everything that needed to be done. Terrible experience. The condo association does not seem to be addressing issues in the building very well either. The board meetings are not clearly posted or accessible to tennents and owners of the building. Also the building needs to have an on site maintenence man and do some interior and exterior renovations to the building.Cost - Very High for what you get. I pay over 1200 a month for a small 350 sq foot studio. Not a fan of having no dishwasher or washer dryer in the apartment for that price either. My unit does have full kitchen w/tiny sink in kitchen and in bathroom which i heard is rare here! Only good thing is the convenient location being in the outskirts of waikiki and the high floor view of the city and you can see part of the ocean. No free internet unless your a hotel guest. I do get free cable from the building though, that is a nice benefit, with good channels.Rooms - Average overall, noisy, thin walls. Overall can only give it a one star rating because it doesnt have any functional saving grace other than being good for a short stay as a hotel. Can hear tv or talking through the walls, doors slam shut here with the keycard entry, noise from sirens outside go through hotel windows (which are somewhat sound proof). I dont hear much of the traffic except for gunning it motorcycles every now and then. Have ac unit, which is nice, but could be maintained or cleaned more regularly (not sure if anything here is cleaned regularly or maintained properly). No vent to the outside from kitchen vent, just blows things around inside. Bathroom is a nice size and partially upgraded with granit countertop. KItchen itself has water damage that was only partially fixed by landlord. Popcorn cieling falls off when you come in contact with it in any way. Curtains let a lot of light in if your trying to sleep, can also get very hot inside if your facing the sun, not a lot of protection there either. Dust on cieling is tough to clean off, stains on cieling never cleaned off either, fortunately small. Sleep quality i would give 2 or 3 stars, except i have woken up to cigarette smoke smells from both outside or from the bathroom or electrical outlets and had to move my bed to be further away from it. The one rule i noticed that is followed is there are no pets in the building allowed. They must have enough trouble keeping track of all the people that live here, adding pets wandering the floors and emergency stairwells would be a real health and safety hazard i bet!Overall - Very dissapointed, not alot of choices for decent housing in the Waikiki area, so I came here and thought this place could meet my very basic needs. Alot of other negative reviews for this place make perfect sense with how poorly the place is run. Needs a change in management and a remodel for safety reasons and funtionality, as this could be operating at a much higher standard and bringing in more money for the owners and provide a good place to live. I will not be renewing my one year lease here! If i could rent a storage unit and go put up a tent somewhere safe I would do that instead and probably have a better living experience!","Tamuning, Mariana Islands","chrisff3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tamuning, Mariana Islands</strong>",39,1.0

The good thing about this hotel is the location, you are in walking distance to beach and restaurants. Across the street is an ABC store a subway and a 711. Tony Roma's restaurant and dollar car rental is one block over. As well as scooter rental. I used uber when needed to go someplace that was not close enough to walk had never used them before but they where great a lot cheaper than a taxi.

I would not try to impress anyone such as a significant other here. I found the staff friendly, although frequently when I would stop by the front desk to ask a question, no one would be there manning the desk - they were in a back room so I had to call out to whoever was working to get them to come help me, which was mildly annoying. During my stay, I spent the majority of my time away from the hotel, often leaving before sunrise and returning after sunset - there was just too many fun things to do on Oahu to waste time in a hotel room. Because of this, I was not as concerned as others might be with the lack of luxury here. There was a pool and small hot tub that I visited on my last night - again nothing fancy, but the kids in the pool seemed to really be enjoying it.

And I've stayed at a lot of hotels. The only reason for staying there is because most other hotels were up to occupancy. For starters, the hostess at the desk was rude. There are a couple of shops near the lobby and the whole area smells like old fried food. If you hang out in the lobby for more than 3 minutes, expect to smell like chinese take out. When we got to the room, we didn't notice anything seriously wrong aside from the age and the size... (really small for two double beds). We dropped our luggage and went out to eat. When we returned, we noticed some sort of smears on the old popcorn ceiling. The shower was extremely small and looked like it was caulked by a two year old. The walls in this hotel are so thin, that you could literally see and feel the wall move from the next unit. You could also hear everything..and I mean everything. We asked to be moved to another room and the same rude clerk asked why it took us so long to decide that we wanted another room. Altough the new room was a bit cleaner, the window a/c unit never really got cold. We decided to just suck it up for the next night. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. There is so much more I could say, but why bother. It doesn't seem like the hotel really cares anyway.

As far as looks go, it is not much to look at (a little rough around the edges). Also the surroundings are less than picturesque. There were a lot of homeless people near the entrance, that made it a little scary. The elevators to the rooms are only operated with your key card, so we didn't see any vagrants in the hotel. On a positive note the staff was AMAZING!! They gave us great suggestions on things to do on the island. One of the men at the desk told us we were very close to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it's beach. We walked there and that ended up being one of the biggest highlights of our trip. Without this man we wouldn't have even known this gem was right down the road. We also had a large gap in time from our check out and our flight, so they let us store our bags. We then went on a snorkling tour, and they let my friend use a complimentary room to shower before we headed home, even though we had already checked out. I really thought that was above and beyond!!! Really appreciated the effort. One of the days here they had the water turned off for maintanence for a few hours, so that was inconvenient, but I thought the staff really made up for it.","Saint Louis, Missouri","Becky M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",14,3.0

We approached the front desk and told them what happened and each time the reply was ""you did not align the key card properly?"" or ""you bend the card too much"", etc. We watched and talked to other guests, and were told they have similar experience with their keys so it is definitely not an isolated incident. One day, neither of our cards worked and we have to get back to the room right the way, as usual, when we approached the front desk, the clerk did not believe us, so we told her to try it herself. She went to our room and she could not open our door with our keys either. They called security and 2 of them showed up and neither of them could open our door with their master keys either. They called maintenance and at first they thought it was the battery that went dead, but after replacing that, it still did not work. Finally they replaced the whole key card unit and replaced it with a new one and from then on, we have no trouble entering our room.

So were the ants. The showers worked ok and the water was hot but you ended up standing in 6 inches of water as the drains didn't flow. Thanks to the previous users who left their hair in the basin, the shower and on the floor, and thanks to the cleaner for leaving it for me.The lounge furniture was uncomfortable ( and not the same as in the photo) and the decor is old and tired. Everything is worn, stained, chipped and marked. The curtains and blinds were gross, moldy, ripped and frayed.The aircon was the worst. It was so loud and rattled constantly but you had to keep it on as it was so hot. The windows opened but the noise was too much to leave them that way.The pool area was ok.This place would be ok for a family on a budget but if you want any kind of comfort don't come here.

The hotel is old and in need of much upkeep; many of the rooms are now operated as condo properties so there are a mixture of visitors and residents, which results in increased security, one of the nicer things, however the key-card system intended to separate the floor zones is should be upgraded or maintained, since the readers don't recognize the cards much of the time; I had to get my room key redone before it would work. The room was small, but had decent amenities other than the window air conditioner, which could not be aimed away from the bed; there was also a musty, moldy odor in the unit. Guest services are minimal; there is no furnished Internet in the rooms; for an extra $7 a day, they rent you a standalone interface that worked OK but was very slow by modern standards. The only WiFi is in the lobby. Parking was also a hassle, since the in-building garage is owned separately and they have no chargeback arrangement with the hotel. This meant that I had to pay for parking separately, IN CASH, and was not able to bill it to my room charge, which is something I expect in a decent hotel.None of these problems are disastrous, but they did take away from my satisfaction with the establishment.

Other sit-down restaurants were within few minutes’ walk. There was even a Seven Eleven. Since everything was very expensive in Honolulu, it was good to have not so fancy things around too. I had a microwave, a small fridge, ironing board, free coffee first day. The room was very clean, good bed, plenty of good lighting. Although I had no ocean view (5 minute walk to see the ocean as I said before) my room faced a canal and mountains in the background. It was kind of fun to watch crew practice.

So I had to rearrange the furniture to have everything on. Luckily enough the table was very small and can be dragged. The studio was very small so I had to make sure that I did not bang into the fridge or the television. Actually I found it rather humorous moving things around. So, I did not see it as a big deal.First night I could hear the traffic down the main road, but considering that it was a city, it was not bad at all.

So, we called the front desk and to our amazement we learned that there was no ice bucket, furthermore, there was no ice vending machine. What a bummer. But, that was the only thing negative we found about the hotel. I would advise that they get an ice vending machine on each floor. It is Hawaii, after all and Pina Coladas taste better with ice.We discovered that we needed to find a camera shop and the front desk assistant was kind enough to recommend two camera shops for us. He even went online and printed out a map for us to find our way. We were able to find the camera shops and get what we needed. To me, that was above and beyond the call of duty.

Papaya soap, and shampoo in the bathroom. Close to bus stops for 2, 13, and B busses taking you to Chinatown, or to the busy part of Waikiki and 4 bus to University of Hawaii of Manoa. Recommended to get a month pass for $60 at the 7/11. So you should go at the beginning of the month, and maximize the value, there's a 4 day pass for $25 for a shorter stay. Public transit is $2.50 each way. Laundry on the 5th floor, makes it easy, and hastle free. Change machine located next to the payphones in the lobby. And detergent and dryer sheets only 2 bucks from the front desk. I was in room 1813. Very nice view of the North side of Waikiki, and you can see the daily rainbow from the mountains. I'm not use to the heat, so the AC was amazing in the room. Definately recommend the late check out if your catching a late flight. Also for a cheap lunch, go to the University with your bus pass. $6.19 for a different daily special, and you can buy something for later too. And you have to go to a Rainbow Wahine Volleyball game if they're playing.

So forget aesthetics, all what you need close to Waikiki is clean, cheap place to sleep and take a shower. If these are your goals, this place is for you. For us personally, the only major negative point is a very loud noise from the traffic. This happens because AC is very poorly integrated into the windows and let pass all noise from the street. So as the consequence we could not sleep well.

This should have told us, we arrived to police on scene dealing with problems at the mini scooter hire shop next to the lobby, hmmm, them greeted by a very nice lady at the counter which is situated...well its almost outside there is no lobby as such. We were checked in and told our room, we went up, the elevator was old, badly maintained and had to share it with a lady who had the largest basket of laundry ever, thats no vacation laundry. We got out of the elevator and was greeted by decor that was dated and just awful, the colors on the woodwork were nasty and badly painted as if my teenage son had done it. The room was small, with two beds that had torn and badly stained sheet, we didn't even sit on them in case of what we might find. Everything had a dark layer of dirt on it, the cable from the wall to the ceiling light, the microwave, the television. The screen on the window was chicken wire used for animal pens, below the air conditioner was a metal tray of water. The closet looked like it might collapse at any moment and it stunk of something similar to vinegar. The view out of the window was onto another tower block that had broken out windows with wood covering the doors and tattered curtains blowing in the wind. We looked briefly at the bathroom and that was when we decided no more. We walked our cases back down to the lobby (well desk really) and stated we could not stay in that room, they showed us another but lets be honest it was no better. We checked out there and then. On a plus they offered us a full refund which did surprise us there so customer service was good. Oh and as we walked out the hotel with our cases in tow another police car was dealing with yet another problem on the street, We took that as the ultimate sign.

Our room was clean and cleaned well daily. It is not a luxury hotel but is less than half the price of the luxury hotels. It is near the nicer hotels so the neighbor hood is just fine. We walked up and down the street to the beach and had no troubles. Someone mentioned the need for your key card to use the elevator. I stayed in a Hyatt in South Carolina in which you had to have a card. That is common in high traffic areas. It's called security. I would stay at the Hawaiian Monarch again in an instant.

It actually feels like you are renting creepy apartments. Because of the shared nature of the building you need to slide your room key into the elevator to be able to use it at all.

Without our GPS, we would not have been able to find this hotel. The hotel didn't even have a sign. The parking is $16 a day that you can't charge to your room because it is independently owned...and they only took CASH. So a good part of our vacation budget was unexpectedly spent on parking fees. There is no public parking anywhere closeby. The front desk smelled heavily of Pine Sol when we checked in. It felt and looked dirty. There were two computers infront of the front desk that didn't work, and there was no WIFI in the room. The front of the hotel had a moped rental place that just cluttered the whole front loading area. The hallway felt greasy, smelled musty and was dark. All of these led us up to our room that smelled badly and felt dirty. We wanted to turn around and run! The shower had black mold in the grout. It was a place where you would not want to take your shoes off and not want to lay down on the bed because the whole room just cried bed bugs. We opened the curtain to look across a boarded up condo with a guy standing in a window watching our room! The nicest draw to this hotel would have been the pool area, but when we checked in we were informed that it was being renovated. I called Expedia begging to change our hotel, but they made it so difficult to do and required us to pay for the new hotel on our own and to risk not getting a refund from this hotel we were stuck in.

Rooms have fridge, TV, and microwave. No free internet and no free breakfast. I stayed on the 15th floor and I had perfect view from my room’s window. If you stay in this hotel ask for a mountain view room. Note: The hotel offers a one–way free bus ride from airport to hotel with the Roberts bus company. You should take advantage of this. On the downside, one thing that you will notice by just walking in the hallways is that the hotel is old. My room was small and it’s furniture was old and in bad condition (dirty, scratches). Both carpet and mattress had some weird strains that honestly I don’t want to imagine what it was. In the bathroom, the bathtude was dirty (black sand) and during the nights a strong tobacco smell was coming from the ventilator. All rooms are close to elevators and you constantly can hear a “beep beep” sound whenever the elevator door opens or closes. This was very annoying.

Saturday morning was very eerie because the news put out a warning that everyone near the beach must stay above the 12th floor for their safety. Sirens were blaring. The young lady at the desk called and asked what were our plans. We asked if we could have a late check-out. We went downstairs and ""Josh"" the manager was on duty and he said he couldn't do it but he had to charge us for another day. WTH, there's a tsunami warning in effect. No problem. We'll check out. We only wanted a few hours until the warning was lifted. Most hotels will accommodate if you ask. I didn't see a line of patrons trying to check in. I would even pay for a partial day.

I had to pass by numerous clubbers who were overwhelmingly young, native hawaiian, attitudinal, and rather sad looking.The employees at the front desk were very nice and very apologetic that they were out of modems ($10 per day) and therefore the only internet was on the (3) public computers directly across from the front desk in the very small lobby. They graciously afforded me 60 minutes of free internet. (It's that kind of place.)I was told that I would have to pay $14 for parking. I went back out and entered the parking structure.

There was literally no spot left for hotel guests to park while registering.When I reached the top (5th) floor of the parking structure, I knew I had entered another world and one where I did not belong.

I booked it because it was inexpensive and before I read any reviews of the place. After having read some of the reviews, I was dreading this vacation.We checked into this hotel September 7 and departed September 13. Thankfully, we were pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian Monarch. It was out of the heart of Waikiki (which we liked), and although the rooms were rather small (similar to those in Manhattan hotels), ours was clean and safe. Admittedly, the halls and the lobby could use some updating. And it might be nice if the elevators were air conditioned. The pool was very nice (a little spartan perhaps) but we only spent a couple of hours there one evening while doing a load of laundry.Others have noted that there are not a lot of amenities at this hotel. This is true, so if you want a hotel with a restaurant, room service, spa, etc. don't stay here. But if you want a safe, clean place to shower and sleep, the Hawaiian Monarch is worth the money.The desk staff was very helpful, as was the bell captain. Considering how little time my husband and I were in our room, we're glad we didn't blow a bunch of money on another hotel.

The rooms had those small window units that you find in some backwoods mom and pop motel in the middle of nowhere. The rooms were about the same too. Many of the units are being sold off to buyers, so needless to say, in the mornings we awoke to the sent of ciggerettes blowing in under the door. The front desk said we could stuff our 2 towels under the door to stop the smell from comming in. When we arrived there were multiple police cars present for some reason. We saw them there often during our stay. There was a nice pool, however no hot tub, and no towels at poolside (had to use the ones we stuffed under the door.) And where did they come up with the only a short walk to the beach and shopping? Long hot walk to all the attractions. Felt like I was in the getto surrounded by low income housing. Might be OK for someone on a REALLY TIGHT budget, but would be too embarresed to recomend to a friend. NEVER AGAIN. Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars on a nicer hotel that is close to the attractions.

Oahu was simply paradise but the Castle Hawaiin Monarch Hotel was a disgrace. We have travelled to lots of different places and stayed in lots of hotels worldwide and this without doubt was the worst we have ever encountered. I have no idea what the nightly rate is as we booked it as a package here in England. To keep it simple, it is dismal, dark and drab. It is the most un-welcoming place we have ever seen. The entrance to hotel reception is appalling. The rooms are 'furnished' to an extremely poor standard and the bed linen was disgraceful. Dirty, holed and unironed would be a good discription for starters. Its a long way to travel to be disappointed and we certainly were that.
