It's an elegant boutique hotel that feels like it was designed by the cast of Friends, with its warm wood tones, interesting art and sculptures, and bright, comforting colors. And the experience is topped off with the decorator's unique touches like scented spray for the pillows and fragrant bath salts. Definitely an oasis from the chaos of the city, and with a friendly, yet professional and competent staff to boot.If you stay, be sure to grab breakfast at the lovely, serene breakfast room (they have the best turmeric almond lattes in NY). And don't miss exploring the clever outdoor courtyard and the elegant drawing room.

But we’ve been staying at Soho House lately when in New York, and unfortunately that has upped our expectations as far as hospitality goes, leaving us a little bit disappointed in our experience here. The public spaces are still beautiful, the rooms are still beautiful, but it’s the small things. We are given one small bottle of water in the room per day, for two people, so we need to order it from room service or pay for the one in the minibar. Glassware that’s been used is removed but not replaced. There are no coffee maker or tea provisions, which would be nice in a hotel of this caliber. The rooms are very quiet, which is a giant plus in NYC, but so much light seeps in through the shade and draperies that you wake up really early. There are not many personal amenities in the room—toothbrush, razor, straightening iron — (ok I get that’s unusual, but it’s so nice)—like Soho House generously provides. The hotel is five star for sure, clean, quiet, beautiful, in a great part of town, but they could step up their game a little bit.

The walls of our room were covered in gorgeous gray flannel (so warm and inviting in the wintertime). The bathroom was on the smaller side, however, was made of stunning gray patterned marble to compliment the gray flannel walls.The hotel is located on one of the quieter streets in SOHO, which is one of the top 3 neighborhoods in NYC. Breakfast was included with our room rate; and was awesome! The bar/restaurant is cozy and adorable. There is also a small library bar located off the reception area that is available only to hotel guests, which is a nice touch.

The Crosby is a treat for the senses in every possible way. You are greeted by soft lighting, a warm and friendly staff, and a very high degree of elegance without opulence. The integration of colors and textures here brings you to a Zen-like place very quickly, and the outside world soon melts away. It's not over the top gaudy at all, but well coordinated design elements are everywhere. Even the hallways are bright and colorful with clever graphics and furnishings. As I sat relaxing in our suite, I couldn't help but notice the attention to every detail of the room. It doesn't feel, smell, or look like any hotel room; it's like home, only better. Our suite was immaculately clean, as was every common space that we saw. A feature I really liked was the motion sensor activated night light in the bathroom; no need for any light in the room until you need it. The staff here do their jobs very well and the wait staff in the restaurant was also amazing. I cannot say enough good things about this place, and highly recommend a stay there when in New York. It will be hard to stay anywhere else once spoiled by the Crosby; they do it right!",New York,"MRP01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",78,5.0

We also asked for a humidifier for my daughter's room. The desk guy asked if it would be okay if they charged us for it. At almost $1000 a room - hard No! Lastly, a point of art - in what is clearly intended to be an intimate hotel, during our week long stay not one employee called us by name.

We wanted somewhere special to stay, but a boutique environment for my 50th birthday. When I couldn't see the dates I wanted online, I emailed the hotel and they were able to find the room we wanted when we wanted it - perfect start! Prior to arriving I emailed the hotel again and asked for restaurant recommendations for my birthday dinner - shortly afterwards I received a list of about 20-25 locations near the hotel that they recommended, along with food types, price range etc - more perfection!It was when we arrived at the hotel that I just couldn't believe how amazing it was. Chocolate and champagne on ice were waiting in the room for me (they had remembered from when I contacted them earlier), the room was so divine, the staff were the friendliest and most accommodating staff I have ever encountered at any hotel and the location was absolutely amazing - stay in SOHO!Throughout the stay whenever we left the hotel staff gave us a genuine smile and good wishes for the day and whenever we returned they welcomed us back. Nothing was too much for trouble, and the staff were happy and engaging. We received hand written postcards mid stay, enquiring after us, and chocolates mid stay. It is these little touches (that you rarely receive in other hotels), and the friendly, professional and helpful staff that make staying here worth it.The decor is stunning in this hotel, I just soaked it all up. We had drinks and nibbles in the bar one evening (superb cheese platter), and it was a relaxed, inviting atmosphere.The location was perfect for us. It is just off of Spring Street, about 50 metres from Balthazar (where we went for my birthday breakfast), and about 2 blocks from Broadway. I visited Dean & Deluca most mornings for iced latte (its a 2 minute walk from the hotel), but there are so many other small, 'artisan' coffee shops around that I ended up having multiple coffees each day. There's a subway close by if you need it (we walked almost everywhere, including to Central Park - which is quite a hike, but we like walking).It is definitely a mid to high range hotel (depending on what room you get), but if you're like us and want something for a special occasion, then its worth the splurge.

The next morning we were awaked by power tools working on the ceiling above us. It was so loud that when I called to ask the front desk what was going on, I literally had to yell into the phone. They were like ""oh we're doing some light remodeling."" What????! Who gives a person who specifically asks for a quiet room a room where there is construction going on!!As I explained to them, if I had a guest staying at my house and planned to do construction above the room in which they would be sleeping, I would at least tell them,"" hey we're doing construction above your room, hope that's ok with you."" In this instance, not only did they never tell me, they charged me an extraordinary amount! So unethical. While this has happened to me in other hotels, I would never have expected it of a hotel of this caliber.Other signs of slippage. Typically, the Crosby has impeccable service. They don't get things wrong. This time, in every single room service order, something was wrong. They forgot the ketchup, the utensils, a part of the order. Nothing major right?

When the rooms next door or above get cleaned (including pulling up the blinds), you hear it. No such issues at the Whitby.Restaurant: What a let down. It’s a hip and happening bar, with great drinks, and the food is yummy, but the hostesses are just not on-the-ball:- At the Whitby most staff remembered my name within a day of arrival. Here it seems they still don’t know that I’m even staying at the hotel five nights later.- Yesterday evening, there was nobody to seat me, so I milled around at the entrance for a while and eventually grabbed a menu and picked an open table myself.- Generally, when unsure about a wine, and asking whether one can have a try, it would be customary for the waiter to come with a bottle and pour you enough to taste. Not at the Crosby. There is no trying here, they’ll just put the full glass in front of you. - Over the course of five days, they tried several times to seat me right next to the wait station, even if other tables were available. I would’ve thought that rejecting the same table or having myself moved once or twice would be enough for people to get the message. Who wants to sit right next to the wait station where they have to clock in orders and rustle around with stuff? - Once, I specifically pointed at a table that looked like it had just been abandoned and asked to sit there, to which the hostess responded that it was taken. 15 seconds later a waiter appears to clear it - and no, it was not taken. How about just asking your guests whether they have a preference - that’d be the easiest solution, especially after you see the same person repeatedly and know (or should know) that they’re not a walk-in.Notable exception: Roberto - a great waiter, who saw what happened, saw my discomfort and immediately offered to move me (and overall was very good at making me and other guests feel welcome and comfortable).Reception: Overall good, albeit not quite as personable as at the Whitby.Concierge: Did not use concierge services for any bookings. However, I did ask them to bring my luggage down on check-out and later found that my coat bag handle had been torn off. Not a big deal per se, the thing was neither expensive nor very sturdy, but it would have been appropriate for someone to tell me that this had happened.Summary: It’s a nice place if you have to stay downtown, but it feels like “just” another boutique hotel ... and for this price you can choose from a few of boutiques. (And, yes, after the Whitby, I expected more). Firmdale prides itself on creating places that feel like home (or perhaps an Uber-pampered home). If you want to get the full experience, then choose the Whitby. The Crosby seems to need to some more management attention.","London, United Kingdom","Sunrider88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,3.0

Now that we've discovered the Crosby Street Hotel, we won't be staying anywhere else. The hotel is warm and welcoming, with not a hint of the corporate austerity of other NYC hotels of a similar level. The art is light and bouncy, the décor a modern London aesthetic plastered onto New York in a joyfully uncynical manner. The rooms are large, well lit and feature huge floor-to ceiling windows (with cushions to take a seat upon the floor and watch the street below buzz away). The breakfasts are lavish and impeccably prepared (as well as being reasonably priced), the gym though small is well-equipped, and the staff, always friendly, seem to genuinely enjoy their work. The location too is fabulous. Yes, it's SoHo, but not the bland brand land west of Broadway. Here, a stone's throw from Nolita and the galleries, hole-in-the-walls and delis of the Lower East Side, the cobbled Crosby Street abuts some of the City's most interesting restaurants, bars and stores.

From the doorman to the reception and concierges, the staff treats guests with warmth and genuine sincerity. Your visit here feels like being part of a special club. We stayed in a top floor deluxe room and loved the lay out (very quiet too!). The design is simple, uncluttered and color schemes are bright yet immensely pleasing. The rooms are redone about every six months and that is something I really appreciated. When we walked in, the finish was pristine and immaculate, as if it had just been redone prior to our occupancy. The bed was very comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows presented an exhilarating city view. The one detraction was that there was no coffee available in the room and it had to be ordered.

I have stayed in several of the Firmdale hotels before and this one certainly didn't disappoint. i checked in late in the evening from London and to my surprise found out I had a room upgrade which was fantastic! One of the reasons I enjoy the Firmdale hotel chain is because of the interior designs and art - this one certainly lived up to the hype! I am a woman and often travel alone for business; I find this hotel chain very welcoming and feel very comfortable staying in any of them. The evening concierge helped my with my luggage. I can't remember his name as I was a bit jet lagged but he was so helpful and even volunteered to pick up anything for me I might need outside the hotel. He showed me the drawing room with the honesty bar and coffee in case I found that I wasn't able to sleep or might be up very early due to the time difference. I found the hotel very quiet for a NYC hotel. The sleep quality was excellent due to the comfortable bed and high quality sheets and pillows. The pillow spray was a lovely touch. In the morning, the breakfast menu had great choices and great service. The bar was a lively place in the evening to meet for a drink before dinner. The outdoor patio area looked like a perfect place to visit in the summer. The drawing room was an excellent place for have a drink - such a beautiful room!The hotel is practically across the street from Bloomingdales and the MOMA shop. There are many great restaurant choices in the area including Lombardi's pizza, Balthazar, Jack's Wife Freda and Osteria Morini. We also visited Haven Spa on Mercer.

Let's start before arrival, shall we?My husband and I were planning to attend a party in NYC and since we would only be in the city for a few days, we wanted to stay close to Chelsea, where the party was being held. We usually stay in midtown when in New York, with the exception of an unmemorable stay in a different SoHo hotel many years ago. I wanted to try SoHo again so I was delighted when I found Crosby Street. I was familiar with Kit Kemp's Ham Yard Hotel because we'd had drinks there over Christmas. The hotel was so lovely, I made a mental note to stay there one day. I booked Crosby Street through the Grand Luxury Hotels website, which I highly recommend because of the perks guests receive after signing up for the (free) L Club. I booked a reasonable Deluxe Room and was not too concerned about a high floor or a view of the city because we wouldn't be spending much time in our room during our two-night stay. Shortly after booking, I was emailed by the Grand Luxury concierge. She was very helpful with questions I had and efficiently arranged our transport to the hotel from EWR. A day or so later, I received another email saying we had received a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Room on the top floor. Fantastic!When we arrived at the property (transported in a luxurious Mercedes SUV by the friendly Igor), the reception agents were all smiles, warmth, and professionalism. They truly made us feel welcomed. Our agent informed us that we had been upgraded to the Meadow Suite. I was momentarily confused because I had already been informed of an upgrade to the same level of room we'd reserved, only top floor. But I was delighted because I'd heard the word ""suite,"" which meant we'd be in a larger room. The agent then explained that the Meadow Suite is one-of-a-kind and has its own private garden. Nice, I thought. But that was before our porter took us on a tour of the hotel then up to our room. ""Nice"" is inadequate a word to describe the Meadow Suite. It is large and so, so lovely, with a dominating palette of soft green and taupe. I knew it was meant to be when I saw that the room's upholstered headboard matched the invitation to the party we would be attending, as well as the dress I planned to wear. I just don't know how it could have been more perfect.As for the luxury and comfort of the room, it is flawless. The bed is a dream, the bathroom is superbly appointed (two vanities, a shower, a soaking tub, full-sized, heavenly RIKRAK bath products) and so spacious. Everything about the room is marvelous. The large, peaceful garden would have been an idyllic place for us to have coffee in the mornings had the weather been better. But the floor to ceiling windows in both the bedroom and living room afford such spectacular views of it, we could still enjoy looking at the birds and foliage from the comfortable bed or couch!When we returned downstairs from oohing and ahhing over our accommodations, we stopped by the desk to profusely thank the agents for the upgrade. Then we went into the lovely library/parlor to relax for a bit before heading into the streets of New York. The agent came to the parlor a few minutes later to ask when we would like our complimentary bottle of bubbles sent up (another perk of the L Club). The service all over the hotel is to be commended. Everyone we encountered was helpful, friendly, and seemed genuinely happy to be there and to be of service to the guests. We received the L Club perk of complimentary breakfast for two in the charming restaurant, as well, and were impressed by the food and service. One of the maintenance men working in the stairwell even walked me all the way downstairs to the restroom when he saw I was confused about where I was going. I'd say the only thing the hotel staff were not able to do was help me purchase one of the large RIKRAK gardenia candles, but only because the hotel was sold out of them! I am enchanted by Kit Kemp's design aesthetic and her signature touches all over the hotel will make you want to go home and redo your whole house, perhaps even your whole life! I love racking up great hotel memories and our stay at Crosby Street is one which will never be forgotten. Thank you, thank you!",,Ode2Joi,34,5.0

The toilet door did not fit properly and couldn't be locked.

I was pleasantly, almost overwhelmingly surprised. The hotel is staffed at a very high level, with educated and cheery service the norm. It has the cool vibe of a Soho hotel, with great, youthful decor, an exciting lobby and lounge, a beautiful bar and restaurant (with outdoor patios) and yet...no crazy crowds. This hotel has the warmth and scale of a small hotel with all the amenities of a large one. The rooms are a 9+. Great beds and linens, wonderful housekeeping, perfect bathrooms with all the extras. I can honestly say that I was sad to leave my room the last time. I can't think of anything that the UES hotels have better than this one, and this east Soho/Nolita neighborhood is near or where everything is happening...not to mention that it also contains an outpost of almost every UES stalwart retailer and restaurant.

And if you needed an ironing board, you had to request one from reception - small things admittedly but not ideal. Do try to get breakfast included in your rate – it’s very, very good but paid for separately it can be very, very expensive.

I've probably stayed in every room including The Meadow Suite and the two bedroom Crosby Suite. The arc of this place was ""hidden gem"" to bustling ""euro hot spot"" to established ""in the know"" downtown staple. It has held up VERY well and the rooms appear as fresh as the day it opened.Each room is unique with a lively decor. Walls are upholstered which is an interesting design feature that also makes the rooms dead silent. The neighborhood and the views are distinctly SOHO, not a lot to look at but that is the charm of this place. Bathrooms are well appointed with awesome water pressure and towel warmers. Lobby bar is a great place to end the day or start the evening. The restaurant is a better breakfast spot then dinner although Balthazar is right down the street, why eat any place else?The rooms are definitely pricey but it is well worth it. Upon check in the concierge had arranged for a beautiful bouquet of Hydrangea in celebration of my wife's birthday. They always drop a note of thanks and a gift which was a lovely scented candle. We had the kids with us so booked semi-connected rooms which was perfect and there was a tray of cookies waiting for them. Nice touches.Always call to make a reservation and if they say they are booked, call again. They never seem to get that right.This is my favorite hotel in NYC!

The thing which is not so ok is the service. Whilst there are some really good people working over there, my husband and i were quite ""surprised"" by the attitudes and behaviors of some others. The lady placing people at the breakfast is an example- she would never greet us with a smile; she would never remember where we like to be seated (or where we don't like to be seated)....and we stayed 9 nights (hence 9 breakfasts!!). The waiter at the drawing room as well was quite a challenge- always had to wait for a very long time to deserve his attention... Thumbs up however for the waiters at breakfast.

So for this cultural expedition to Manhattan, we chose The Crosby. In summation, it was everything that we hoped for, and the cost reflected that! The rooms were great, high quality and trendy. Since it was just the two of us, the size wasn't an issue, but don't expect the spacious kind of room that you might get for a similar price in other cities (Vegas, San Francisco, etc). We weren't familiar with SoHo, so part of our strategy was to stay at the Crosby, so that we could experience the neighborhood. If you've never been, SoHo lives up to its funky reputation -- trendy eateries, hotels, and shops, intermixed in an active commercial area, and all that comes with it. Ironically our key activities were mostly in Midtown, but it worked out fine, because there are two different subway lines withing a 5 minute walk each of the hotel. Our subway trips to Times Square/Broadway, Columbus Circle/Lincoln Center were inexpensive and quick. The staff in the hotel are very solicitous and friendly. Excellent daily breakfast in the hotel restaurant/bar was included in our room rate. Although we didn't use the library, patio, or roof top, they enhanced the ambiance of the hotel for us. Unfortunately there wasn't a movie night in the hotel theater during our stay, but I suspect it would have been a nice perk. If your looking for a price deal, The Crosby is not the place.

The decor is wonderful and so full of character with a welcoming drawing room for all guests, a thriving bar and a small restaurant with easily the best breakfasts. I had the burrata scrambled eggs which were sublime and my husband had the English breakfast (a proper one replete with black pudding) and poached eggs on another occasion. Both were delicious. We were also hungry on arrival and were served tuna tartar and burrata with fresh tomato at 11pm in the drawing room. The food was so good, I wished I'd had dinner there on our last night after a disappointing meal at Tao.I wondered if we were in the NYC I'd known before as it was so quiet. The rooms seemed well sound proofed with the only weak spot being the door. Being off the beaten track, I only heard one siren making this hotel an oasis in the city. It's well located for shops with a huge variety from high end Saint Laurent to high street J Crew and Zara. Lots of great restaurants are in walking distance with a great vibe.The service was wonderful. As a Brit, I appreciate it when the staff takes its cue from my more reserved nature and they were helpful and friendly, but never overbearing or insincere. Everyone, from the wonderful night concierge, Noah, to the chambermaids was welcoming. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in with wonderful mattresses and pillows (we even asked for the details before we left).

The hotel is very fun with whimsical, eclectic and interesting art all over - in the lobby, the private guest drawing room, the restaurant, hallways and individual rooms. The staff was welcoming and exceptionally helpful. I had asked for an early check in, if possible. We arrived just before noon and were told the prior guests hadn't vacated yet. We had no problem with that and headed off to a delicious lunch at a restaurant the concierge recommended. Shortly thereafter, The Crosby called to let us know our room was available. Since they couldn't meet our original request for an early check in, they upgraded us to a room on the top floor. It was spectacular with beautiful furnishings and a dynamite view over the city rooftops. The concierge was again very helpful this time with recommendations on where to shop for a New Year's Eve outfit. The bellman always had a cab ready for us and made a smart suggestion for us to take the subway from uptown to SOHO on Sunday afternoon instead of sitting in a taxi in traffic. We're good travelers and the subway was the best option at that time of day. The Crosby's private Drawing Room was the perfect place for drinks and appetizers before heading out to the theater.

When we went to the room, it was a little noisy so we ended up asking her about the possibility for that upgrade. She accommodated and we went up to room 904. The room was spacious and clean although missing a chair (imagining they were cleaning it). The bed was SO comfortable we asked at check out if she could tell us what it was. She had a file right there and quickly made a copy for us. The hotel bar/restaurant was heaving so we chose to sit in the private lounge for residents and they had an honor bar set up which was a nice touch. You just have to sign your name & room to the little book. I had room service in the morning and it was delicious and very filling! Room service was perfect (it's usually my pet peeve) & was no more then 15 minutes and everything was there and then some! The smoked bacon was delicious BTW, I highly recommend it. I'd like to stay again when we have a bit more time to enjoy. Although, I highly recommend it.

Having lived in London, I've been very spoiled when it comes to knowing what a good afternoon tea is. Here in NYC, I've been disappointed not to find a single worthy afternoon tea. The Plaza's tea (twice) was poor (with stale bread, amazingly); the Pierre was unexceptional, dull even; the RItz-Carlton's was a calamity; Lady Mendl's was the best of the bunch, but only passably charming (but still mediocre). Then I discovered the Crosby Street Hotel's afternoon tea. Goodness! THIS is how afternoon tea is done properly - and with aplomb. I would actually call this a sort of 'rock-and-roll afternoon tea', while carefully acknowledging the sacred rules of the afternoon tea ritual. Being a little 'rock-and-roll' (the afternoon tea, not me), I wouldn't therefore have expected to like it (my preferred choice in London, for example, is the Ritz). However, this afternoon tea just knocked my socks off entirely - a careful marriage of rock-and-roll panache with tradition, elegance and the greatest sophistication. By the way, I've never tasted a better blending of matcha and white chocolate (their mini tiramisu) - my taste buds could only think ""crikey!!"" for the next 5 minutes, and in a very good way!Every single aspect of this afternoon tea was flawless (including Kit Kemp's china designs, and the treats/cakes, each of which left my taste-buds in a riot), but a special note for the Marigold tea: the most sacred of all principles when it comes to afternoon tea is that the anchor - the tea - should never be eclipsed by the food and should easily be able to hold its own against even the most astonishing, ravishing treats. Rarely does that happen (at least here in NYC) - and this Marigold tea simply stole the show. There is no need to go anywhere else for afternoon tea in NYC.","New York City, New York","WhatcanIsay_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",28,5.0

We loved the guest lounge/drawing room where we would relax after a fruitful day of shopping and touring, whilst late at night we would indulge in a nightcap.Breakfast every morning was brilliant, quite filling! Our kids loved the place and the interior lobby setting was a visual delight with sculptures and artwork. We called a head of time to the concierge to arrange for dinner reservations and shows. They were able to accommodate most requests, but fell short of getting a reservation for the restaurant we wanted, but at least the consolation prize was our old favourite, Per Se, so not a total bust. It was easier and more cost effective for us to get our own broadway tickets. I would say that the concierge service we received was competent, but I would think it definitely has some room for improvement. The views from our rooms were spectacular and the high ceiling with almost floor to ceiling windows rounded everything nicely. Of course the highlight is to go to the rooftop garden/farm to see the produce that is grown for the restaurant as well as chickens for the eggs! Loved the place and we would stay again without hesitate when we come for Christmas! Great hotel, zero pretense and attitude which you typically encounter in other NYC, but not here. Absolutely loved the place.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","johnchkim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",103,5.0

As in London there is a great resident only Drawing room to relax in and a honesty bar for late night drinks. The day we left I was sat in the middle of 3 people with laptops out talking loudly on a conference call . After 30 minutes I could put up with it no longer and went to reception to ask they be told to move to a meeting room - to be fair the manager came in and asked them to move but they said the waiter had said it was OK - it turned out they were non residents. The breakfast is great and dinner was pleasant. My big issue and the reason for marking this hotel as poor is the concierge - an important resource when travelling and I would assume they are working for the benefit of the guest - not so at the Crosby - we asked for some suggestions re what was on and one suggestion was the play - ""The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime"" we asked the concierge by mail if they could sort tickets for us when were in Vegas en route to New York - they came back to say they could get us best tickets on the Saturday performance through their 'Trusted Broker"" for $450 each !!!! - when we got to NYC I went online to the Theatres website and got the exact same seats for a total of $331rather than $900 .

As the name suggests, the hotel is on Crosby Street in Soho, parallel to Broadway and nestled in between Spring Street and Prince Street. The location is fantastic - you are in the heart of Soho, which makes this a fantastic base for shopping, dining and sightseeing. On several occasions I would pop out to one section of Soho for an hour, pop back to my room to drop off my shopping, go to another section, pop back again etc. This is great to be able to do in the summer heat of NYC!The room itself was immaculate, with a lot of space - an absolute rarity in NYC, though you do pay for it in the room cost, and the bathroom was quite small - the room is well-appointed with a good sized wardrobe, very comfortable bed, mini-bar, and writing desk. My room faced onto the street but there was no street noise at all - amazing when you consider that you are right in the middle of noisy Soho!Service was good, not excellent, though I found this common across many places in NYC - hotels, restaurants, bars alike. In the restaurant, for example, I found that the staff unhelpful - for example, the details of what was and what was not included in the continental breakfast were not explained. One day I had a bill for $30 for drinks with breakfast, another day they were included - and it was only on check-out I saw drinks were included. This is something simple that would make a big difference.

We both quickly agreed it's one of our favorites ever. We had booked a standard room on the second floor but were upgraded to a deluxe junior suite on the sixth floor, which was so luxurious but in a super-comfortable way. We both decided that we would very much like Kit Kemp to design our homes, what with the effortlessly chic and cozy decor all throughout the property.From top to bottom, this hotel has been flawlessly thought out. As many others have said, once you enter the hotel, it feels a lot more like being in a beautiful country retreat than a city hotel one block over from the bustling main artery of Manhattan's downtown. Our room was incredibly spacious, and stunningly laid out, all done up in deep reds and whites, and giant industrial windows. Such a nice little (silent!) oasis from the loud city. I can tell you honestly, the pictures on the website don't do the design of this hotel justice. Everywhere you look they have thought of everything. Charming dog paintings in the elevator, artwork and printed framed storybook text in the bathrooms...it's a joy to walk around and 'explore' the little things left for us to find. Artwork, furniture, linens: everything is absolute top quality but really approachable as well. What resulted was an experience from top to bottom that was relaxing and luxurious, yet felt fun and quirky at the same time.We had breakfast in the Crosby Bar both mornings, as it was included in our room, which we would highly recommend doing. The crowd seemed predominately European, and although the prices were very high, we could order whatever we wanted as part of our package. The buffet of fruit and granola was SO yummy, the french toast out of this world, and the smoked salmon bagel incredibly generous with its helpings. My favorite thing about the Crosby is its character...there are no shortage of sterile New York hotels that all seem the same as the next, but the Crosby is totally unique in its comfort and almost homeyness, and in its quirky colorful design and little details. There are so many nooks to sit and have a cup of tea or an intimate conversation, and the whole hotel feels very personal and warm. I do have to agree that the service as a whole at this hotel, though we thought it was good, does feel very ""young,"" as most of the employees we encountered were in their twenties and somehow lacked the ""seasoned"" feeling of older employees at other hotels. The young energy goes along with the new, modern feel of the hotel, but the service doesn't compare to other establishments in the similar price range.Our only few qualms were the fact that our room didn't have a bathtub, the hotel didn't have a pool, and the difficulty of getting a cab on the side-street where the hotel is situated. We were in a hurry to get my grandmother to the ferry and the porter had to run out to the main street to see if he could find a cab. We ended up waiting too long and calling an uber ourselves, but in general this is kind of an inconvenient feature that most NY hotels don't have to deal with.Overall, we loved our experience at the Crosby, and can't wait to come again and experience its whimsical charm, or to try out some of Kit Kemp's properties in London.","Palo Alto, California","Chloe R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>",40,5.0

Finding the hotel and unloading luggage from the car was a little challenging as the hotel is a little set back from the adjacent buildings and the doormen stand inside the door until you pull up. Finding a place to park outside and to be in view of the doormen could be a hit or miss. The hotel itself is as expected for the brand - the small foyer is stylishly decorated as are the staff (smartly attired). Our room was nicely adorned, decorated and extremely comfortable - arguably plush. With floor-to-ceiling windows, it was very bright but still suffers a little from the outside noise - especially in the morning. Singular restaurant had good ambiance and provided great food (breakfast and lunch). Our experience with the staff was mixed - several were friendly, courteous and professional but we did encounter a few who gave you the impression that you were not worthy of their attention. I suspect that the hotel receives its fair share of notables but we were on vacation and were in a more relaxed mood than some of the other patrons. To be made to feel that we were ""lesser"" customers was not a nice feeling - I mean, it was obvious how they thought of our presence - particularly in the restaurant - so much so that our family elected to leave a day earlier for another adjacent and equally luxurious establishment. On a more positive note, this is a very pretty hotel - and its location is great if you are a shopper or on vacation - as it is served by at least 3 subway stations. I would recommend the hotel if you have thicker skins than we do and don't mind the arrogance and pretentiousness of a few members of the staff.","Boston, Massachusetts","Seng100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",193,4.0

The room is really comfortable and roomy by NY standards. And the views are superb. The bed is extremely comfortable and the furnishing are modern and quirky. We had breakfast downstairs once – which was absolutely delicious, but there are lots of other places nearby. And of course you can't beat the location of this hotel in terms of SOHO/ NOLITA atmosphere and the shopping (it's right opposite the MOMA museum shop).Of course it's expensive, but you get first class service and quality.Only minor incident from my end: I had asked for a package to be sent for my attention in advance of my stay.

It is a perfect place to meet friends and grab a drink before dinner or have an after dinner cocktail and dessert as we did. It is quiet, has comfortable couches and the service was perfect as always. One extra bonus, as we sat having our drinks, a stream of flashing lightbulbs went off outside the hotel. My daughter went to see what was happening and to her surprise it was J Lo coming into the hotel. The hotel has a beautiful cinema room which is were J Lo was having a private screening for her new movie. Since it was less than a 12 hour stay, I chose a basic room which did not disappoint me.

I wanted to go to one of my very favorite hotels, the Covent Garden Hotel in London, one of several ""Firmdale Hotels"" as I do every year. Alas, it just didn't work out this time, so I decided to stay for four nights at one of the Covent Garden's sister hotels and the only one in the U.S. The Crosby looked so lovely. Reception, complete with cubby holes for keys, so very similar; the decor, always personally arranged by the Firmdale's owner.There was a drawing room! The rooms had some delightful touches! Everything LOOKS great at the Crosby. Also, it is located in a great part of Manhattan, Soho and the small outdoor garden is likely lovely in milder weather. But this is just the point it ""it looks..."" Emblematic of this is the fact that the Drawing Room features two fireplaces (as does the CG), but they are fake in the case of the Crosby; a line of tall candles stand, solums-like as if defying you not to love a shortcoming as if it were a virtue.That was the preface. Here is the ""but"" and it is a significant one. The Crosby looks rather perfect, in step with its sisters, but the service is, on the whole, terrible (with the lack of the employee of the year, who was fantastic) and the food is nearing wretched, though it might improve if it ever arrived warm. Now, I expect that many who read this review might have selected the Crosby following the same logic that I did. Maybe the slipshod attitude and astounding pockets of mediocrityI came to realize that there were 2 problems, at least in my experience. First, staff. They are okay, though whenever I ordered room service something like, oh, half of the breakfast was missing and I never seemed to get a place setting to save my life! However, what makes the Firmdales really distinctive is not just how it looks but how the staff makes it feel. At the CG (always going back to my best case here), the staff is welcoming in a warm way. They are capable without being officious. A number of them are transplants from other countries--Italy, Poland, etc. but they are no less capable and articulate. At the CG, when one arrives, there is an actual quasi-room for the concierge staff. And they are attentive, inventive, helpful...they know London and can get you into some of the best restaurants at the last minute. In short, they are fantastic. Arrive at the front desk and after a single dialogue, the desk staff will likely remember you and have your key ready. Service to the Drawing Room, Room Service, the adjoining restaurant is always impeccable (and they always ask 'for how many' so nobody is stuck (like me, constantly), without linens or silverware). Also, the food at the CG is good. In fact, it ranges from satisfying to delicious. Oh, and the Honesty Bar is respectable and stocked with the ingredients of a martini, bloody mary, soda etc. NOW for the Crosby. On the phone, the desk staff is rather clipped--not completely rude, but they give the impression that they are very busy with something more important (and they don't discriminate; I had one of the very best rooms). They are abrupt and not necessarily skilled. I was given the wrong room key twice.The rest of the staff is the same, though some are exceptionally kind, most are polite in a very casual, careless way. For New Yorkers, they are fine. Direct and rushed. But this is a Firmdale. This is supposed to be a sister to fantastic boutique hotels in London. It is mimicry. Oh, and although none of the staff was rude, it felt like it was run by a bunch of lazy Americans. When the concierge sent up staff to assist with luggage, the staff member greeted me with ""Hey, how's it going'? What do ya got?"" Satis dictum; enough said.Also, as an aside, I mentioned the food. It is not good and it comes out tepid at best. Oatmeal and milk had developed a skin etc. Also, some things (like the chocolate pudding cake and the corned beef hash and the pastry basket etc.) were simply not good in addition to being the wrong temperature. If you are still reading, I hope that you have a sense of what I'm trying to communicate: The Firmdales are more than their material parts. The STAFF makes everything work, makes all the pretty material objects part of something even better. The Crosby has a great location and looks pretty, but you can find much better boutique hotels in the area. In fact, if you are looking for that experience, you're likely better off there.

My only regret was not being able to stay in the Meadows suite which has its own terrace and wildflower garden in the summer.","Winston Salem, North Carolina","Jane S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winston Salem, North Carolina</strong>",8,4.0

My wife and I have an 11yr old and an 8yr old. We opted for two end rooms that had a common connection/foyer-like scenario (as opposed to one of the suite setups). That gave us two separate rooms with kings, two separate bathrooms, two separate couch areas... etc.Everything went great! The hotel is beautiful and has a solid ""guests only"" reading room with honor bar for booze.The concierge crew handled everything we threw at them really well. The pulled together great babysitters when we needed them.There were a handful of music pop-stars staying at the hotel during our stay, and the staff did a great job not letting things become a fan zoo (other hotels in NYC don't do as well with this and it can wreck the stay). Despite paparazzi and fans lingering on the street, things never got chaotic in the hotel, or outside.Breakfasts (buffet and full menu) were delicious and covered the entire family's needs well.Housekeeping did a great job knowing when we were in or out, and I found very little disturbance from them.The courtyard gave everyone some space to hang out on their own when folks needed a respite from each other (as did the reading room when dad needed a solo drink).In the basement is an incredible screening room that does movies on Sunday nights. I highly recommend this experience.The gym is basic but gets the job done.Only criticism would be the lack of a dedicated doorman. Concierge crew seems to do double duty here and they're always busy doing concierge stuff.There is an incredible rooftop garden and chicken coop that is a must see for the kiddos. Just ask the front-desk and someone will run you up there.Also, when I say this is good for families, I mean the property can be made to work for families. They don't have special kiddo facilities or programs. In my experience most of the nicer boutique places to stay don't go out of their way to accommodate families (for obvious reasons), it's a question of whether or not you can make it work well at the property.

It is also a great location in the soho area, near some great restaurants. We ate one dinner there which was delicious, although it was a bit of a strange concept that most of the dishes didn't come with sides, you had to pay extra to a price that maybe could have at least included some vegetables. The only reason I didn't rate the hotel as excellent is because at breakfast every morning the kitchen/service staff seemed unable to get it seamlessly right. To be fair, one of the party was lactose and gluten intolerant, however after the first day you would think this would have been clear, or there would have been a better understanding of the dietary requirements. The food when it came was of course delicious, I could not fault it... but with what you're paying for in the hotel you would expect the restaurant service to be more refined.

The decor is beautiful and the food is fantastic. Since then, I have always looked for an excuse to stay there and finally had the chance to book a room there for my wedding— my fiancé and I wanted to spend the night before the wedding apart and I wanted a place that would work for getting ready with my sister and mom as well as a place to stay with my husband the night of the wedding. I booked a deluxe room on a top floor, but when I mentioned that I was getting married that weekend, they upgraded me to a 1 bedroom suite on the 11th floor. The room was absolutely stunning, with an incredible view of the neighborhood. It was also extremely quiet and I was able to get my beauty rest the night before my wedding. All of the touches in the room, from the furniture to the glassware, are highly curated and beautiful. It's elegant without being stuffy—comfortable luxury.The staff there was incredibly helpful. When I needed something printed out they brought it up to my room almost immediately. As I was leaving the hotel in my wedding gown, it was raining and the doorman took each person from the door to our car with an umbrella and helped us with all our bags. When my husband and I arrived on the night of our wedding, there was a bottle of champagne waiting. Everyone was super friendly.The room service was also delicious. I ordered breakfast twice during my stay and it was wonderful.Although the hotel is expensive (I don't think I could bring myself to pay full price for a suite there!) they definitely pull out all the stops and treat their guests right.

The hotel is beautifully and uniquely decorated. From the time you arrive you are greeted by very friendly valets to help you get bags out of your car; escorted to front desk to check in, and then assist with luggage to your room. Our check- in experience was fine except rooms were not ready @ 1:30 pm. After a few minutes we we're told rooms just became available on the 4th floor. For $600+ a night I would have expected a higher floor. One room was right next to elevator and our second room just down the hall. Both overlooked Crosby St. versus the backside of the hotel overlooking a private garden/patio area. Def preferred our view but heard the garden view side is much quieter. On the 4th floor you def hear the street level noise, even with windows closed. And I could hear our travel mates talking in their rooms from the hallway. Crystal clear. Our room's decor was just mediocre. A bit flat and unexciting with navy and yellow curtains with a matching headboard. The highlight of the room was the bathroom. Very roomy with double sinks and a shower that made you want to stay there all day. Water pressure was phenomenal. And to top it off, towels hang on a warming rack. Beds were so-so comfy. A bit too firm for my liking. The hotels restaurant was the worst part of the hotel, IMO. Service was really slow. I mean REAALLY slow. You'd think they had to get everything from the dungeon 3 levels underground where the bathrooms reside. The food was absolutely not worth the prices they charge. We started off with the housemade guacamole. Good. Then we shared several items such as the margherita flatbread. Crust was soggy and chewy. Overall taste was bland. Not good. The Reubenini sliders. Basically a Reuben sandwich cut diagonally to make 4 triangles. Just okay. Croque Monsieur... Great if you like bread. The bread was very thick and nestled between two slices was a modest amount of ham. Again, just okay. The highlight was the housemade bar fries. Tasted just like McDonalds shoestring fries. Delicious. $157 later we left very dissatisfied wishing we had walked to the corner and gone to the highly rated Balthazar for lunch.Overall, our stay was pleasant. Location in SoHo is great. But everything we wanted to do was midtown ( theatre district, Saks, Henri Bendel, Patsy's...) With the exception of the restaurant, the hotel service was top notch. Wouldn't stay again.

I arrived early, before my husband as he was traveling from a different city ... and I only had to wait about an hour and a half. I sat at the bar in the hotel restauant and had an amazing breakfast.

So very very comfy. I slept sooo well! I usually travel with a sound machine and in this room I did not need it!! The walls are covered in fabric and help with the sound proofing. I was most impressed!! The huge warehouse style window with cushions on the sill was my favorite spot to sit in the sun and watch above a few rooftops and out over the city.

There were at least two beautiful chest of drawers as well as a nightstand with drawers to keep things tucked away and tidy. Lighting was wonderful - in bathroom and our room. There was a very comy sofa and chair as well as a desk and chair. The bathroom is amazing too, Heated towel bars for 4 big towels and although we were there in the summer - I swear the floor was heated.

Beyond the luxury and top-notch location in Soho, some of the details are what really made this place fabulous and unique:- Turndown service includes a complimentary Evian bottle for each guest, as well as very pleasant smelling (spa-like) room spray, also these unique French cuff links (at least I think that's what those were)- The conceirge and staff went above and beyond to accommodate a special request I had for surprising my mom upon arrival w/ a note and bottle of wine; the bell man also ran several blocks during a rain storm to hail a cab for us...these acts are above and beyond what your typical NYC hotel will do- back Garden is lush, tranquil, and beautifully decorated. It's a gorgeous sanctuary in the city and I haaven't seen anything like it at any other hotel in the city. Building is also rated LEED Gold- Like many other reviews mentioned, the room is HUGE compared to standard hotel sizes, including a very roomy bathroom. The floor to ceiling windows make the rooms bright and airy and the view from the upper-level floors is AWESOME. I would just sit and look out the window. Bed is also very comfortable.The only downside is some of the staff seem a bit aloof and snobbish, while others are extremely friendly. I kind of felt like it's luxury boutique hotel kind of catering to the snooty crowd or celeb-type clientele and if you don't fit that mold, you were kind of looked down on. However, this was only a few of the staff and maybe I'm just sensitive (b/c my mom didn't seem to notice a thing). Plus, most of the staff personnel were really, really friendly. One other thing to note: the Library Room and Honesty Bar are a cool perk, but beware if you actually make your own cocktail. The prices are pretty ridiculous ($20 for a shot of vodka) and I made my own drink pretty stiff and got charged $40 when I was checking out. Sure, I probably had 2 shots in my drink, but I was flabbergasted they actually measured & charged me $40 for one cocktail. I've stayed at other 5-star hotels in different cities/countries (ex: Esperanza in Cabo, Boca Raton Resort & Club in Florida) and this competes with the best of them. The price is pretty hefty for even their basic room (in fact, the per-night room charge at Crosby is on par w/ the Esperanza - which is on Conde Nast's Best Hotels in the World list) so I think it's a little overpriced for what it is, but that doesn't negate the fact that it is a unique, amazing luxury hotel in Manhattan.","Chicago, Illinois","iamkimmycoz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",14,5.0

The hotel is ever ready for a photo-shoot but they have also considered how everything feels and works. The beds and furniture are comfy, the showers super strong, plenty of light, perfect alarm clock, lighted closets, solid doors, fabric padded walls for quiet, an inventive and a delicious room service menu that satisfies both adults and kids. The location is perfect for a fun trip to NYC, right in the heart of SOHO and right around the corner from a couple different subway lines that put the theaters, midtown, etc. just a few minutes away. The visual appearance of every nook and cranny has been well considered. Not sure if they have just renovated after being open several years but almost everything is in pristine condition. The lobby, an art and garden oasis, even smells divine. All of the employees we encountered seemed like invested professionals who provided excellent service.Caveats - the views are mostly of the very close neighboring buildings, the best/only place to enjoy your room service is sitting on the floor at the coffee table (junior suite connected to deluxe room), some rookie mistakes like an alarm clock left on from previous guests or missing utensils from room service. I'd also add that the junior suite, while significantly more expensive than the next best room category, provides, as far as I can see from our two rooms, a larger and lit built-in closet vs. an armoire, a larger bathroom, and a slightly larger room. I'm not sure there is a consistent price to value relationship though I would certainly opt again for the junior suite on future visits.Overall, this hotel definitely elevates your entire experience in NYC.

I was glad that I did.It's almost like they have transplanted one of the London properties into SoHo. Arriving at the property presents the same feel as arriving in The Haymarket in London. Cheery faces and the now expected readiness to please attitude from the Front Office staff. My room as not quite ready on arrival, and I was politely shepherded into the restaurant adjacent the lobby and settled at the bar for a drink while I waited. This restaurant reminds me of Brumish as well. The same warm, comfortable furniture and English drawing room feel with uplifting colour added to the decor. Once again, great food and beverage served with flair and confidence from the staff. The restaurant has a an outdoor terrace, which I can imagine would be lovely when the weather isn't -4C!Now for the rooms. Again, that same British feel and complete with the transplanted bathrooms and British made tap ware. My shower door did not close properly and ended up with a large puddle around the toilet and moving towards the sink. A small matter, but could be dangerous as the tiles are grey and some people would not necessarily see the water on the floor, possibly slipping. A very comfortable bed as well as the signature seamstresses manikin in matching décor. My room looked out onto Crosby street with floor to ceiling glass windows to enjoy the very urban view. Double glazed windows shielded me from the street noise.As far as the location is concerned, a great spot central to SoHo and surrounded by lots of shopping and food and beverage locations, literally a skip around the corner or across the road.I've rated the property a 'Very Good' vs. excellent, for only one specific reason. My breakfast experience this morning and the behavior of the staff in the restaurant. Sadly, this disappointed me. It may be my feelings only, but I found the hostess surly when arriving for breakfast. I was really looking forward to the experience and this set me off on the wrong foot. As I type the manager is standing at another table mentioning, 'that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.' That should be matched with a cheery greeting when you arrive at what would otherwise be a great experience. This experience continued with my waitress determining that despite never having met me before, I would be referred to as 'honey', for the duration of the meal. I then got to listen to the staff discuss their love life. For me, in this standard of property that is not acceptable and far too familiar when I am paying $600 USD per night to stay. I can see that the hotel does have a number of regulars and definitely agree that this type of rapport is both appropriate and familiar, as I would expect to be treated if that was my circumstance.Having noted this, I would definitely stay here again. As I've noted before I really like what the Firmdale brand offers as an overall hospitality experience. Although the challenge of building a brand, is that customers then start to compare. On this occasion my comparison was related to the staff's manner and behavior compared to London and it came up a little short. I hope that this can be addressed so that the next stay moves my comments to 'Excellent'.","Las Vegas, Nevada","Im_a_travlin_fool</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",42,4.0

It has a unique, contemporary designer feel. The hotel is located in a narrow street in the heart of Soho, a short walk to Little Italy and Chinatown. Our room, on a higher floor, had a nice outlook over the roof tops of the city. The bed was very comfortable. The room wasn't overly large and there wasn't much storage for our luggage. We've stayed in larger rooms in NYC for less than what we paid here. Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was outstanding with a selection of tasty options although we thought the $7 lattes were a bit steep though. New York has a long way to go in the coffee stakes. On that note, a Nespresso machine in the rooms would do wonders to change this perception! The concierge service was outstanding. They organised concert tickets and recommended and booked restaurants before we arrived. One small glitch was a recommendation of the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park (for the view). Give this place a wide birth - it's a tourist trap. Despite booking weeks in advance we were told there was an hour wait when we arrived for our 1.30pm reservation - we didn't hang around unlike the long queue that snaked out the door. Apparently they had booked too.Handy tip: for those away from home for a long period of time like we were there are a few laundry services located a short walk away that do a large bag of washing for $15 (same day service). A criticism I did have but not about the hotel but about the city was all the rubbish strewn outside along the streets of Soho. It felt dirty, looked terrible and we saw two rats on the street within hours of our visit. On a previous visit to the city I had not noticed this before.",Brisbane,"ClassyLad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",129,5.0

So from a physical perspective the property is great. However the service lets it's down. F&B is really more faulty towers than five star. Firstly there is no real provision for in house guests so if you don't book you wait for a table. Yep New York style. Madness they don't have an allocation or configuration for in house guests.... I've never experienced this at a hotel of these prices!!!! Then there is the service in the dining room or lack of it. You can seriously wait at your table for put to Hal an hour before a server will take your order. Often my coffee would take 20minutes and then meals after and then another 15minutes to get the check. This place is the ultimate test of your patience.

It’s also within a short walk from Little Italy, Chinatown and Brooklyn bridge for those who are interested in the nearby tourist attractions.  The hotel itself has a striking décor, both reflected in the communal areas (try the lounge bar – fantastic!), as well as in the beautiful rooms. The rooms had all the amenities you could need and ours also had commanding views of the city – a wonderful view to wake up to! The whole experience of the place was that of an exclusive boutique hotel. The service was overall very good, especially the concierge. However one minor complaint was the service in the breakfast room, which was a bit slow. The breakfast itself was good, but not great, with a very limited buffet.

We decided to try a new hotel, so I booked Crosby st. We always stay in Soho, the location is perfect for shopping and our favorite restaurants. We arrived at the hotel which is located nicely and on a cute street. The woman at the front desk seemed inexperienced and was not very welcoming, there was an envelope for us and she started to open it and then pushed it towards me and said ""it's free drinks coupons for our bar"" I said well thank you but we don't drink. She said ""oh I guess I'll try to find something else for you"". Fyi she didn't ""find something else"" Then the bellman showed us to our room, I had reserved a suite, the curtains were open, it was early evening and not 10 feet away was a man in his window, I am used to the city and close living, but this is an internal courtyard with out even the distance between buildings you would get with a street in between. So I went back down and asked for another room. I dealt with another woman, who gave us a VERY SMALL room by the service elevator, I don't have to tell you what that was like at 630 in the morning. So we checked out and went to our usual Hotel for the duration of our trip. Overall I would say if you do stay here, ask for a street side room not the courtyard.

We were surprised at the attention to detail in the artwork and decor in all of the rooms. The two spacious yet comfortable conference rooms had their own color palette and feel with beautiful furniture and pieces of artwork you won't see anywhere else. There is even a movie theater/screening room where they offer specials on certain nights and weekends. We didn't get back to the hotel until after 1 am and wanted a nightcap. The library off the main lobby offered an ""honor bar"" even though a waiter came to take our drink order. Our hotel room which had an amazing view from a huge oversized window had a fully stocked bar and a bathroom one could only dream of- gorgeous marble walls and flooring with a flat screen TV above the tub and spacious free standing shower stall. The front desk staff were actually very nice and friendly. I was not expecting that in a boutique NY hotel. Our only bad experience was in their adjoining restaurant at breakfast. You would have thought the waiter had to pay us to be in his station. He was the epitome of NY rudeness. Not a ""good morning"" or ""can I start you with coffee"" not a smile-Nothing! And that wasn't the worst part. After we ordered our food, I had to pull him away from a conversation with another waiter to ask for my coffee--he disappeared and another staff member brought it out. We waited quite a while for just our water and OJ, but when the food did arrive, our waiter delivered it to us and never asked if we wanted any refills, how our food was-- again disappeared and never returned. Ever! We finally had to leave and another staffer came to clear our dishes and leave the bill. Unfortunately, I had to excuse myself to the ladies room and my husband handled the bill. He later told me a 15% tip was automatically included in the bill! I couldn't believe it! If I had known before we were in the cab, I would have gone straight to the manager and let him have it. Bottom line, the hotel was fabulous and well run with terrific staff--they should either separate themselves from the restaurant or have the front desk train the wait staff in the business of hospitality.","Yardley, Pennsylvania","Wozzies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yardley, Pennsylvania</strong>",16,5.0

They seem to think that because they're busy they don't have to show any appreciation or loyalty to a returning customer. I figure we'll probably come to NYC about six or eight more times in the years ahead but we won't be staying at the Crosby. So that's somewhere around 15 or 20 room nights they're losing because they wouldn't spring for a continental breakfast.

The concierge sorts it all, from tickets to shows to restaurant bookings to directions to planning your visit to museums so you see the attraction rather than someones back in a queue. The end result is that one almost feels like they are a New Yorker. The breakfast is lovely and the buffet is healthy.

I expect that Firmdale hotels will not drop the ball when it comes to standards of decor, service and relaxation - but you can never be sure, so it was very reassuring to find that The Crosby Street still remains a welcoming and delightful touch of England in NYC!Located in SoHo this was Firmdale's first expansion outside its native London and was also the first purpose-built hotel in the portfolio. This part of New York has become a trendy destination and certainly suffers less from sidewalk-overoad! Galleries, boutiques and designer shops plus individual restaurants and bars are neatly packed into traditional architecture it has less glitz than mid-town but is more relaxed and attractive for it.And The Crosby Street fits perfectly into that vibe with ultra-helpful staff, a very knowledgeable team at the concierge desk, supremely comfortable rooms and an excellent bar-restaurant that is every bit as buzzy and bustling as a newly-opened celeb-destination all combine to make the hotel a great choice for aNew York City stay - whether for business or pleasure.This visit was for the NYC Motor Show, so I had a small group in tow and this is another area where Firmdale excel - they go out of their way to make everyone in a group feel individually valued and responded fully and effectively to one of my guests who had a bit of an issue with their room. Without exception they were all converts by the end of the visit!I hear that Firmdale are building a new, bigger hotel in New York and can't wait to see what that will be like - but it will have to be good to unseat The Crosby Street.","Ascot, United Kingdom","Sue-and-Steve-Ascot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ascot, United Kingdom</strong>",247,5.0

Bathroom is nice with good shower (no bath in deluxe room) and a heated towel rail (so you can actually do a bit of laundry if you like rather than send everything out).As others have said the location is great - walking distance to everything in Soho, Noho, East Village, and Greenwich (and even Little Italy if thats your thing...). So right in the middle of some great shopping. Not many great places around to eat, but theres always subway and taxis... (btw I echoe how bad Balthazar down the road is... good burgers and pulled pork sandwiches up the road north at Back Forty West for lunch though).Only bad thing about Crosby St is the restaurant and the food - we ate breakfast there most days and were very satisfied. But Christmas lunch was an appalling affair waiting an hour for appetisers and a meal of generally mediocre quality (some things needed to be sent back).

The list of reasons for why I love this hotel are endless. To name a couple... The location is top-notch. You're smack-dab in the middle of SoHo, on a cobblestone side street, which means you won't have to deal with as much NYC background noise. You're within walking distance to Balthazar, the MoMA design store, Bloomingdale's, Kate Spade, and all the other amazing SoHo boutiques. Want to see a show on Broadway or check out the Met? No problem - it's a $10 cab uptown to hit all those touristy spots.I also love the British-inspired decor: modern yet classic, sophisticated yet unpretentious, feminine but not girly-girl...overall a fresh take on hotel design. Each room is unique, and its colour schemes are a breath of fresh air. This extends all the way from the lobby to the screening room to the restaurant to the tea room to the gym. These spaces are so unique - no hotel could every recreate this vibe.Finally, it comes down to those little luxuries: Miller Harris bath products, Dean & Deluca minibar snacks, an honour-system bar, Frette bed linens, complimentary Monocle magazines etc. If you're a couple, group of girlfriends, or a mom & daughter duo, definitely consider the Crosby.

When we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded to a top floor delux room. The room was stunning with great views over SOHO. I adored the decor because it was different from the generic decor of so many chain hotels and because it was floral and I am a bit of a girly girl. I also liked the dog themed art in the lifts!The bathroom was lovely. There was no bath but the bathroom was a good size and the shower was one of the best I have ever been in! The towels were nice and fluffy, there were plenty of them and they were replaced very regularly. The little amenities in the bathroom were great too. There was a little hair elastic in the pouch with the shower cap, which was a great touch for ladies with long hair.The location is fantastic for shopping and restaurants and I would definitely stay here again.The little touches such as the relaxing pillow spray that comes with the turndown service and the box of pencils that come with a note from the manager are all really cute and make you feel welcome.I think the service in the restaurant is one area that could improve slightly. I had porridge on the two mornings I was there. It was excellent and there was a choice of small or large oats and a choice of whether you wanted it cooked with water or milk. The first day I received brown sugar in a little dish and no fruit salad (that was meant to come with it). The next day I received the fruit but was give raw sugar. I received a blank look from the waiter when I asked for brown sugar. It came eventually but apparently it isn't a popular request, even though I received it the day before without having to ask.

The room on the 10th had inadequate closet facilites so we asked tobe moved, may be the booking people should not have put us in the room in the first palce but they rectified this as soon as they could. in our opinion the high rooms do provide a good view of downtown Manhattan and the view to the east is more interesting. Not all the rooms are the same size ( or have enough closet space ) so check this when making a booking. we did not make much use of the dinning facilties, when we did it was excellent and service ( dispite the 14th st sub station explosion) excellent.

We were interested in the hotel because we stayed at a sister property, the Soho hotel in London, a few years ago and just loved it. We booked a deluxe room on the top floor but were updated to a Crosby Suite which was just amazing. The one we stayed in is actually the one pictured on their website (it has a bedroom with double door adjoining to a huge living/dining room) and it was unbelievably beautiful. The entire wall of the suite, including the bedroom, is entirely windows with a great view over Soho. The room had absolutely everything including all the touches I need for a good stay - a nice firm mattress, a translucent shade for day and great light blocking curtains for the evening, a beautiful bathroom with excellent water pressure, an ipod stereo system, and a really powerful hairdryer. For me, the bath products were so-so, a little perfumy for my taste, but very high quality nonetheless. We loved this room so much we ended up ditching our plans to do some sightseeing and just stayed in the room and relaxed. We had breakfast brought up everyday so we could sit at the dining table looking out over the neighborhood. The room service was very good in terms of food quality and fast - no more than 15-20 minutes for anything and often times less, like when we ordered drinks up.All the staff were extremely friendly and immediately rush to help you with whatever you might need. Cabs are brought nearly instantly, bags are brought down immediately, etc. The concierge was a big help in making dinner plans and even though we had done a lot of research ahead of time, pointed us to a great restaurant we had never heard of.The location was ideal for us as we did a lot of shopping. There are also a lot of great restaurants steps away including the famous Balthazar (which we didn't go to) and great little gems like Ed's Lobster Bar (best lobster rolls I've had in a long time) and Dominique Ansel Bakery.

In Soho, it is a slightly funky (tho grown-up) boutique hotel, near all the classic shopping, clubs and restaurants of Soho. It has been open only a year or two and is affiliated with a small wonderful hotel group with hotels in London (where I stay all the time). There is a lot to see and do in Soho. The rooms are very large, inviting, with good natural light, large windows, great mattresses, good storage and a good size modern bathroom. Our room only had a shower, which was fine for us. The large windows mean that you will need to pull the privacy screens down a good deal but this did little to reduce the charm. There is a work-out room and the wifi is free and works well. Having stayed so often in one of their London hotels, I felt right at home here.The best things from my perspective were the service which was very good and friendly, with only a few ""bobbles"" or slight slowness. And the private reception room and patio with an honor bar for guests was excellent. The lovely outdoor patio was a real refuge from Soho noise and bustle, simply delightful and romantic in warm weather.Unfortunatly one drawback is the distance to mid-town, if you have business or theatre in that area. It is near enough to the Seaport and Wall Street areas to walk (slightly long but interesting). Cabs seemed reasonably available, the doorman always ready to go find one, but the traffic getting out of the area and up to mid-town could be a problem if you are in a hurry or do not want to use the subway.","Chicago, Illinois","Chicago60604</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",145,4.0

Try to get to level 5 to catch some of the light. On our first stay we were upgraded to level 7. Quite simply stunning and interesting to look into other people's apartments. This time we were not lucky and got only a room on floor 3 room 308.... It looked towards the street and it felt like a prison cell... Not worth the money to spend, as due to the low level it was dark and it looked at an unappealing house front. We were lucky enough to change to floor 4, room 407.

This Firmdale “design hotel” is an intimate, 11 story, 86 guest room gem located in the heart of SoHo. The hotel is just the right size to offer exceptional personal service as well as seclusion. From the moment we entered the Crosby Hotel, we felt pampered by the wonderful staff. This standard of gracious personal service was the norm from all the hotel staff we encountered during our entire stay. It was just the right balance of attentiveness and privacy that’s really hard to describe, but I just know and appreciate it when I experience it. The hotel’s common areas, lobby, Drawing Room (guest lounge), Sculpture Garden (inner courtyard), restaurant and bar are very stylish, welcoming and tastefully decorated with original artwork and sculptures. If you visit here, make sure to get downstairs to check out the private event rooms, screening room and bar too. It’s very clear that a great deal of attention to detail was put into the design and decoration of this hotel’s common areas and guest rooms. The hotel is truly an intimate space in the middle of SoHo, akin to a peaceful, carefully designed, visually appealing art gallery. We booked a King “Luxury Room” for our 2-night stay. Although these are among the hotel’s smaller bedrooms at (350 square feet), the room was refined, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Our 4th floor room had a floor to ceiling window directly overlooking cobblestoned Crosby Street, and our room was very quiet. We heard no street noise or hallway noise during our entire stay. The room was attractively decorated with lots of natural light and an excellent King bed with soft sheets and very comfortable pillows. The bathroom was luxurious and impeccably clean. The marble and glass shower was amazing with water pressure approaching that of a medium-sized waterfall! The bathroom also had two pedestal sinks and a heated towel rack which were nice touches. The quality Miller Harris toiletries and Turkish bathrobes were nice touches too. The service and food at the Crosby Bar were wonderful too. On Friday night we sat on the terrace and ordered Mojitos and small plates from the bar menu. It was a great space to talk and unwind after our hectic journey to New York City.Our “Summer Promotion” room rate included complimentary English breakfast each morning (basically a $40 dining credit per person per day). The Full English breakfast offers a choice of 2 eggs any style with potatoes, roasted mushrooms and tomato, black pudding, sausage, bacon, fresh fruit, dates, figs, yogurt, granola, pastries, juice and coffee or tea. The breakfasts were too abundant to finish, but absolutely scrumptious nonetheless. The perfectly brewed Illy coffee they serve is delicious too.As frequent visitors to Manhattan, my wife and I prefer the more vibrant and dynamic “downtown” neighborhoods of Chelsea, Flatiron, NoLita, SoHo, TriBeca, Union Square and the West Village because of the many activities available. We also feel much less “touristy” in these neighborhoods. The Crosby Hotel is in an ideal location close to upscale shops, world-class restaurants, galleries, museums and the many cultural activities available around SoHo, NoLita and Greenwich Village.We’ve stayed all over Manhattan in some very nice boutique hotels over the past few years, and there’s no doubt that the Crosby Hotel is now our favorite by far. It’s truly a world-class property that perfectly combines classic elegance with city chic. The hotel provides its guests with superb service, charm, style, quality, cleanliness and complete attention to every detail. In fact everything about our stay at the Crosby Street Hotel was absolutely perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed our two wonderful nights of comfort and relaxation at this truly remarkable and beautiful hotel. This is our new standard for subtly sophisticated deluxe accommodations in Manhattan. The Crosby is a truly exceptional hotel and a remarkable value. We will definitely be back.","Litchfield, Connecticut","TD60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Litchfield, Connecticut</strong>",118,5.0

I was paying for both of the rooms, and although I had settled my account, one room was never transferred to the other and approximtely $1500 was held on my debit card. I'm not sure what it is with Firmdale, but they never process my bill correctly.Overall however, this was a very enjoyable Christmas made all the more pleasant by spending it in a service oriented, boutique hotel that manages to capture the spirit of London in New York City.",New York,"JujubeeNewYork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",63,5.0

However, the staff was horrible. Polite, but not helpful at all. Housekeeping broke the shade while we were out to dinner despite having a ""do not disturb"" tag on the door. When I called to have it fixed and ask why housekeeping came into my room even tho I left the DND sign, the concierge blamed me for the shade & never alerted maintenance, so after 3 calls, the maintenance man finally arrived. The housekeeping question was ignored even though i asked 3 times. We requested a wake up call which never happened & when we expressed our frustration to the front desk, they desk clerk said flippantly ""sorry"". The bed & pillows STUNK, like dirty hair-I'm guessing housekeeping never heard of Febreze, but they did come in uninvited to break the shade & fold the toilet paper into an arrow....For $700 a night, I expect a better experience. The staff is unnecessarily snooty & apathetic, and in my opinion, incompetent. They smile & say hello, but no one went above those mild pleasantries. The stink was also upsetting, as I had Client appointments in the room & ever client remarked on the odd smell.The restaurant is not much better. overpriced & painfully slow. The Caesar Salad is good, tho. Go to Balthazaar for an amazing meal or head down to Lomardis if you want affordable pizza. The Crosby Bar is disappointing for the price.

The Crosby Street bar and restaurant serves a great bloody mary! Bonus: If you get an upper floor room with an eastern exposure, you get a great view. The hotel is part of a UK-based company, and it indeed has a British accent. A padded dress form punctuates the corner of many of many a room (if not all) adding a touch of class and a nod to the city's roots in fashion and garments, perhaps. That's how I imagine it. While that adds a feminine lilt to the air, the feel is quite understated, not overbearing in personality. Walls are covered in wallpaper that feels like garment fabric, like wool or cotton, in yet another sartorial undertone. The effect is comfort, warmth and high style. In-room mini bars are well stocked, something that is still important to me. Room service is reliably good, and the fixtures in the rooms are very up to date without going overboard on gadgetry.

So why do I wish I could give a 4 1/2 rating. It is simply spotty service. Poor advice, on two separate occasions after asking specifically, at the concierge desk, advised us to park along the street and we were ticketed. Note: The manager was very good and offered to take care of the ticket for us. The wait staff in the restaurant are very spotty. Seemingly oblivious to us twice in the morning. We had to ask for extra coffee and then I had to get up to get the bill both days as all waitstaff seemed to vanish. On several occasions, no one greeted us and no one was at the front door. Not that we expect it but for over $600 a night one should.There were some excellent personnel as well. The young lady with the British accent who greeted us at the front desk for check in was lovely, and the excellent young man who took our bags and commiserated with us on the parking ticket was a great and helpful person as was the manager or was it the assistant manager who took care of our problem with class. Overall, TRY IT if you have the means. It is an excellent Hotel and with just some continued tweaking of the young personnel it will be a 6 out of 5!","Long Island, New York","ForeFood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, New York</strong>",158,5.0

I gave Crosby 4 stars instead of a 5 just because, unfortunately, they forgot to remind us when we checked in that an English breakfast was included in our rate.

Three people working the front desk. Two at the concierge desk. A bar full of great and great looking waitresses. A drawing room for casual conversation staffed by a waiter along with a top shelf honor bar. Excellent rooms with all the amenities you could ever expect--see Bianca's review for details as she is right on.Try to get on the 5th or above for better views. This place is not cheap but it is competitive price-wise with other high end hotels and it is off the charts better.

It's also a real up and coming shopping area and close to everything downtown - and midtown is just a short cab-ride away.

It is a wonderfully furnished hotel for an overnight stay.However, the same thought has not gone into the practical matter of providing accommodation for travellers who are staying for several days.We were in a Deluxe Room and our immediate impression on seeing the décor was very positive. But then, where were the cupboards in the bathroom for our possessions? The bathroom did not look nearly so chic with toothbrushes and other bathroom paraphernalia lining the ledges around it. There was nowhere for a spare toilet roll to be kept so we never got one and we had to continually request replenishments. We also had the same problem with paper tissues. Amazingly, the soap was not changed until the last day of our stay.The bathroom has two very impressive sinks but they are of such size that it was very difficult to get within range of the mirror in order to shave or apply make-up. Despite having two sinks, only one bar of soap was provided and the soap in the shower was a sink soap rather than a shower soap.The bed sheets were not changed until we requested it (we knew because the bottom sheet had a tear) and, yet, the same daily rate was charged as if we were new guests each day.With regard to the rest of the accommodation, there are similar practical issues for the long-term traveller. There are no facilities to make tea or coffee in the room so you have to have room service or go down to the guest room each time you need a coffee or tea. Design triumphs over substance so there is no clock in the room.Room service is not really a practical option in the Deluxe Room as it lacks anywhere for two people to comfortably eat.The accommodation smacks of a designer who has never stayed a night in the room that he or she designed.The bar and restaurant areas are good and the food is good.Service in the hotel is not overly attentive and some of the breakfast staff, in particular, have the knack of avoiding your eye at all times so that one is often left surrounded by dishes and waiting for tea and coffee. That said, there are a couple of wait staff who are quite exceptional. The staff in the entrance area may or may not pay you attention. It seemed that the more staff there were hanging around the foyer (which could be as many as eight), the less likely that any of them would open the door or acknowledge your existenceThe hotel is located in an exciting area of New York that is always gridlocked with traffic and where piles of rubbish litter the streets. However, the street in which the hotel is located is remarkably free of traffic and is relatively clean and quiet.This is a hotel with great potential but it is very amateurish in its approach and lacks basic quality control.We have marked the hotel as a long stay destination. The score may have been a little higher had we merely stayed overnight.","Melbourne, Australia","MadClem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",20,3.0

Discovering the public areas of the hotel was a joy. Each room was so delightful, from the drawing room to the outdoor bar area to the downstairs private party rooms. I could not get enough.Our room was gorgeous, with it's floor to ceiling windows and wide, cushioned low window seat. The upholstered headboard was stunningly done in a tufted green and fuschia orchid print. The lime green, fuschia color scheme was carried through in the comfortable arm chairs and bench at the foot of the bed. The bathroom was a vision in cool grey marble. (And Ms. Kemp gets kudos for equipping her rooms with a 7x magnification mirror for flawless makeup application on us over-40 women who can't see close up as well as we used to!) The plush robes were a delight to slip on. Oh, one of the true treats was the turndown service...instead of the tired old chocolates, we got a heavenly small cannister of bed-linen spray. The scent was very light, but so soothing and wonderful on the nose when you slid between the crisp sheets.I cannot wait to get back to this hotel with my husband again, but also with my girlfriends. You feel beautiful just being in this stunning space.","New York City, New York","Burbanista</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",21,5.0

Crosby Street is our new favorite hotel in NYC. Brand new; absolutely gorgeous, chic, funky decor; top-notch friendly service; well-located on a quiet street in the middle of Soho.Owned and operated by London's premier Firmdale Hotels group (ever heard of the fab Number Sixteen???), Crosby Street is their first outpost in the United States. We were told that a second New York hotel is due to open in midtown later this year.We had one of the premier, corner rooms and were delighted. Good-sized by NYC standards, sparkling clean, floor to ceiling windows, finest quality furnishings and hardware - all from the U.K. Even the smallest touches were appreciated: padded hangers, bathrobes, heated towel rack, and a shoe horn! The bathroom and shower were to die for. When was the last time you had good water pressure from a shower head in a hotel!Public spaces were awe-inspiring and hats off to the decorator. Feng shui to the max. If you stay here, make sure to get downstairs to see the film screening theater, function rooms, and bar. I'd have a meeting in that conference room any day.Every member of the staff was lovely, and we were treated with warmth and respect from the moment we arrived. They are genuinely service-oriented without a hint of snootiness. No faux sycophancy here. They went out of their way to be helpful, including getting us out of a restaurant snafu on a Saturday night (thanks again, George!).Coincidentally, a few days after our return to Boston, we noticed that the weekend Financial Times had a feature about hip NYC boutique hotels. A full two-spread photo of Crosby Street's art gallery, um lobby. Well deserved, and wow did we feel on the cutting edge.The only gripe over our two-day stay had to do with the bar within the hotel's restaurant. Living in New England and frequenting Boston and New York, we are more than familiar with high prices and rarely blink an eye. BUT -- $18.00 for a cocktail is simply over the top. We each had one drink and a tiny bowl of peanuts and the tab plus tip came to $50.00!!! As good as the ambience and drinks were, it felt like a rip-off and we would not visit the bar again. Our recommendation? Lower the prices to within striking range and attract more customers. That being said, we adore the hotel and can't wait for an excuse to go back.","Wellesley, Massachusetts","SusanEK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellesley, Massachusetts</strong>",6,5.0

The decor is genious. The quality of the furnishings and art could not be better. The full wall loft windows gave a wonderful sense of space to the room with wonderful day light, yet two kinds of window coverings for privacy or darkness. The bathroom was perfectly set up for funtion which I appreciated. I was impressed with what lengths the door men had to go through to get me cabs each time. They had to hail them from Spring Street since the cabs dont travel down Crosby, it being a quiet side street. The only strange thing was my check in. I was only handed a key and had the elevator pointed to. No assistance to get my bags to my room or show me how things worked. In addition, it appeared I was given some other persons room as another name appeared on the welcome letter. Made me feel like I got a room that was rejected by the individual for some reason or other. I ended up loving my room though, so did not think anything of it after getting settled. My breakfast was delivered exactly at the time requested each morning and presented so lovely besides being delicious. I also enjoyed having brunch for Mother's Day and evening coctails in the courtyard. I am really looking forward to returning often. Next time I wiil be sure to reserve the top floor rate.

For sure, if you're a fan of Firmdale, you'll recognize right away the Kit Kemp's style but like in all the Firmdale hotels, there is a strong identity. Discreet and elegant, the lobby is dominated by grey oak floorboards and an impressive human head sculpture created with letters of the alphabet. Immediatly when you get into this exceptionnal hotel, you'll feel the difference, the incredible warm atmosphere and the impression to be not in an hotel but in a place where you'd like to live for ever. Adjacent to the lobby, there is a drawing room with marvellous patchwork sofas and a collection of oil paintings showing dogs, the symbol of Crosby Street Hotel and a real New Yorkers passion. On the other side is the Crosby bar and restaurant with a crazily intelligent style full of colours and with a multitude of 50's ceiling lights.This beautiful style can be found in the 86 rooms and suites, each one individually designed meaning you'll be able to have 86 very unique experiences at Crosby Street. This time, we have been so lucky to stay in a fantastic suite (number 906) located at the 9th and offering stunning views on the rooftops of SoHo. The decor with a beautiful scheme of grey, orange, almond, blue and pink colours is truly impressive, with beautiful curtains and no word about the exceptionnal comfort. With more than 65 sq.m, a suite at Crosby is like your own little flat in South Manhattan. A large living area extremly comfy is adjacent to a oversized bedroom with a deep bed and the most perfect linens. In both room, you'll enjoy the floor to ceiling warehouse style windows overlooking Big Apple and the very best bathroom ever with a shower and a separate bathtub, much more larger than the NY standard.There is also a romantic garden to enjoy a cup of champagne when the weather is nice, a state of the art gym and a screening room. Everywhere you'll look, you'll be impressed by the real beauty of this hotel.But Crosby Street Hotel is not only beautiful... This is truly a five stars hotel where you'll meet a team with an heart with the only objective to make your stay so unforgettable. Everybody is very professionnal but cool which is different. You'll be able to be yourself cause nothing is snobish at Crosby Street Hotel. Each person working in this place has always a nice smile on the face and always a nice word to tell you. I wanna point as well on the management team, often not immediately concerned with the guest satisfaction but at Crosby, there is always a manager and the GM himself, Jakob Hansen, is a very nice person and undoubtly one of the best hotel manager i met. We shared a glass of champagne in the adorable garden and he's really motivated to make of Crosby Street, a place you'll never wanna leave...It's undoubtly what will happen to you after a few days in this property. Breakfast are so yummy and even if you just wanna book a Superior room, no worry not to be satisfied cause even the smallest room is large enough for a complete relaxation and the sense of detail is the same for all the rooms or suites.We're so in love for Crosby Street Hotel, probably the best city hotel in the world thanks to the designer, Kit Kemp, who has created a superb place with an atmosphere and thanks to the ultra professionnal team of Jakob who will try the best to make of your stay something you'll never forget.

The Upper East Side hotels are too stodgy and formal, like the Peninsula, or they are too hip and crazy, like the Gansevoort or Standard. The Crosby Street Hotel, mixes the two perfectly. The Art in the hotel is amazing and gives the entire hotel a vibe of style and substance. The rooms are works of art. Someone (The owner) has put their personal touch on every room. The last room i was in had a silver penquin in the fireplace!!! I spend about 1/3 of my life in hotels, so I like to walk in the front door to a front desk. I like to be greeted. I like to feel like this is my home away from home. This place fits that bill. The front desk is great, so is the concierge. The bar and restaurant are also very good as are the outdoor common areas. The location, in the heart of SOHO is great. If you take public transportation, it is just a block away. I cant really think of a negative comment. I have stayed at other Firmdale (the group that owns The Crosby) and i love them all.

You can walk across the street in the early morning to Balthazar to pick up a pastry and good coffee to bring back to the room if a big breakfast is not what you're looking for.

Before the CSH, no hotel had quite managed to fit the bill. THE CSH is now my go-to choice in the city.I won't waste your valuable time by repeating the positive comments made eloquently in many other reviews. I'll simply concur that the hotel is bright, good value for NYC and the rooms are comfortable, interestingly decorated and nicely-sized. There are downsides, which while small are worth mentioning and which others have not really highlighted.The breakfast service is simply hopeless. Restaurant staff are sullen, appear to have short attention spans and poor hearing. Errors and a basic lack of manners are too evident.The reception staff offer nothing beyond the most cursory of welcomes. In some ways, this can be preferable to the gush one receives at the Ritz-Carlton and Mandarin Oriental. On the other hand, it gives a poor first impression and keeps the CHS from getting a full 5-star rating.Other than these fairly minor failings, two-thumbs up.[As an aside, In December 2010 my original booking was at The Chatwal, a hotel so monstrously ugly and uncomfortable that I left on the second day. The move across town to the CSH was bliss by comparison. Should you be considering the CSH and Chatwal side-by-side, i implore you not to opt for The Chatwal.

I had high expectations, and the Crosby Street Hotel exceeded them. From the moment I walked in I felt like I was a welcome and appreciated guest. The property is beautifully kept and has a great vibe. The lobby had a very nice cozy feel, and the front desk staff couldn't have been friendlier (Patrick was a real star when it came to freindly service). I had a great time at the Crosby Street Hotel. I don't typically use a lot of hotel amenities when I travel, so I can't speak to amenity services. The most important things to me are customer service, professionalism, and above-all, cleanliness. The customer service was spectacular. The staff was completely professional, from the front desk to the housekeepers and room service staff. Everyone was extremely courteous. The room was immaculate. It was a good size for New York, with a unique one-of-a-kind style. The mirrors and floor-to-ceiling windows gave the room a nice spacious feel. The personal service and the immaculately kept stylish accommodations were well worth the price of the stay. When ever I make it back to New York, I will definitely stay at the Crosby Street Hotel again. I have no reason to go anywhere else.","Houston, Texas","mcla128</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",1,5.0

The location is fantastic, close to excellent restaurants, bars and boutique shopping and easy to travel to and from by subway.The hotel design, clearly in the Firmdale tradition, is stunning, eclectic and witty with a penchant for pooches. Our room had pleasant views, was beautifully furnished and was a pleasure to be in.Perhaps having expected so much, we were disappointed by the extremely slow and frankly, poor restaurant service that we experienced on the first 3 days of our 6 day stay. Having to wait for 30 minutes to be asked for our coffee order at breakfast and then a further 20 minutes to receive it is beyond the pale. A similar, if not quite so tardy, experience was repeated for the following 2 breakfasts. The Film Club dinner on the Sunday unfortunately, confirmed that this level of service was as much as could be expected. Again blighted by what seemed to be chaos, we like other reviewers received the wrong food. Beyond the restaurant, the housekeeping service was also patchy - frequently not replacing bathroom products and necessitating a call from the shower to get them!I would like to hope that the restaurant service was a feature of staffing during the holiday season and perhaps a less experienced group of waiting staff, as there clearly were great improvements after New Years Day - but only after our complaint to the hotel manager.This hotel is beautiful, in a fabulous location and has all of the potential to become top of its class.

The décor is exquisite and they have nice touches like an outdoor courtyard garden with lights and a Christmas tree. The hotel felt quite buzzy and had a good vibe in the evenings.We asked for a quiet room but were put next door to a lift, although it had good views and loads of light from the floor to ceiling windows. They moved us to a ‘quieter' room, but we found out too late that we were right next door to a cupboard used all the time by staff and the door banged every time it closed! Also, the views were awful although we knew that when we accepted the room. The bathroom was big with good quality fittings and a really powerful shower. The mini bar is well stocked with all manner of goodies, but it was expensive. They have a cinema and ‘movie nights’, along with a gym, and a good range of films to rent. We had a breakfast in the hotel and it was very good, although the service was slow. On the strength of it, we tried the restaurant one evening – big mistake! The service was slow and not very professional. The food was bland, presented badly and the whole evening was made worse when they gave us the wrong food so we ended up waiting a long time.Most of the staff were ok, not brilliant, just ok.

New York was partly closed down but the hotel was open and welcoming , the nearby subway was running and the restaurants in the area were open. We loved our room, particularly the ""warehouse"" style windows across most of one wall and decorating, uncluttered but striking. . The Crosby was only opened a year ago. The hotel ambience and decor might be described as ""English hip"" as opposed to corporate and we liked it very much. The lobby, meeting rooms, and restaurant are very attractive. The staff was very helpful. Breakfast was included and we enjoyed it. The concierge was able to help us navigate the intricacies of subway and bus tickets, and checked to find which museums were open. The location in Soho couldn't be better, Dean and Deluca is just around the corner, the MOMA store is across the street. Balthazar is a grat place to have lunch - it's steps away. And there are a multitude of little interesting shops around too, as well as Bloomingdales. My only reservation about the kingsized bed is that the mattress was hard - I thought this kind of hotel bed had had its day.

The Crosby Street Hotel has been created in what was previously an industrial building (car park) and is a stunning example of the eye for detail and decorating flair of the principals. Tastefully modern, our room and bathroom were large and well-appointed. The bed and linen were of the highest quality, service was friendly and spontaneous and a laptop was provided free of charge. Crosby Street is a quiet, one-way thoroughfare one block from, and parallel to, Broadway in the Soho district. The hotel is adjacent to a myriad of bars, restaurants, clothing boutiques and a Bloomingdales outlet. While there should be no need to venture into the nearby Chinatown or Little Italy ( which, we found tacky and seedy) they are only a few blocks away. Similarly, Greenwich Village, Chelsea and the vibrant Bleecker Street are also a short walk. Cabs uptown to Central Park and 5th Avenue etc. are plentiful and cheap at less than ten dollars and the downtown Financial District and waterfront even easier to reach. There are also a number of subway stations in the vicinity for those who prefer to travel that way.The hotel boasts a bar and restaurant which are justifiably popular. (There is also a private bar for guests which provides drinks on an honour system.) An enclosed rear terrace opens into Lafayette Street and is popular in warm weather. The choices of both food and wine are top class and the service unfailingly efficient. Some past criticism has been directed at the general youthfulness of Crosby Street staff. Exactly what issue this poses is unclear as we found all of them engaging, polite and very capable. The hotel clearly attracts a young drop-in crowd but is by no means a youth hostel. Rather, it is a modern, attractive, comfortable, professionally-run and welcome addition in an exciting city. It offers a quality alternative to many longer established properties of varying standards and, most certainly, to some of the more famous properties further uptown.","Sydney, Australia","Pamela H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",72,5.0

We travel to NYC several times a year and usually stay midtown. I was extremely pleased with our decision to try the Soho area for our hotel on this visit.First, let me begin with the couple of areas that I think the hotel falls a bit short. While not completely rude the front desk staff is less than pleasant. On one occasion when my teenage son had returned to the hotel with friends and asked for our room key, he was told it was not left for him. He insisted that he knew it was and of course was given the key. He felt that he was treated unfairly. The front desk had asked us for his name when we left the key for him. They never asked him for his name, if they had, perhaps it could have eliminated the need of making him feel uncomfortable.Second, the housekeeping should be more consistent. On night one of turn down service, we were left 3 bottles of Voss still water by our beds. We thought that this was a very nice touch. On night two, only one bottle was left. On night three, we did not receive any turn down service. Strangely enough, there was no extra toilet paper left in our room. We had to contact housekeeping twice for additional rolls.Now onto the many reasons why the less than perfect service by some personnel would not prevent us from staying at the Crosby again!Many of the hotel staff were amazing and exceeded our expectations. The concierge went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We enjoyed theatre tickets to a sold out performance and dinner reservations at restaurants that we had never been to. Every night we were pleasantly surprised by their recommendations.The valet and doormen greeted us with a smile each and every time we saw them. When they were hailing a taxi for us in the rain we were politely told to remain inside the lobby to keep warm and dry and they would call us when the taxi arrived. Both the concierge and doormen wished us safe travel on our departure and graciously asked that we return again. We will!The Crosby is a beautiful hotel in a great location. If you have not been there, go!The public areas are beautifully decorated and comfortable. If Kit Kemp would decorate my home, I would hire her. While we did not spend time in the enchanting outdoor garden due to the cold, I have no doubt that when we visit during warmer weather that we will enjoy it. Rooms are spacious, bright, and for someone who is a light sleeper, super quiet. I have never slept so well in a hotel. No speeding traffic, noisy car horns, or waking up to trash trucks picking up at 3 a.m. The beds are the most comfortable I have yet to sleep in. In this day and age the free in room internet was appreciated. Bathrooms have high end fixtures, plush robes, and are very spacious. Rather than the typical chocolate on your pillow, the Crosby Street Hotel leaves a personalized hand written note with a lovely scented candle. What a unique token of appreciation! We had breakfast daily in the restaurant and were not disappointed. The menu is extensive and reasonably priced. Food was delicious and service was excellent. The location of the Crosby Street Hotel is a winner. Right in the heart of Soho with out all the noise. We walked to most of our destinations and used taxis for trips to midtown with ease, even with the busy Thanksgiving crowd.

The public and private guest rooms are luxurious, quirky, and spotless. I really wanted to love the service too, but we had a few glitches, hence the less than perfect rating.We found our room to have plenty of space with a fantastic, wall sized window overlooking relatively quiet Crosby Street. Even though it's an expensive place, I think you get your money's worth by New York City standards. The room had a king size bed with Frette linens, an iPod, flat screen TV, radio, bathrobes, mini bar and ample closet space. Everything feels brand new and as though a lot of thought was put into the quality of the materials used and the little details. I especially liked the little window seats and textures used throughout the grey and lavender room. The grey marble bathrooms are a decent size, but not huge. Our room had one pedestal sink with a ledge running behind it to store your toiletries. The large shower had amazing water pressure. Now to the minor gripes. We found the service to be up and down. Chocolates and a welcome note on our first night but no sign of housekeeping on the second day until we called to request it late in the afternoon. Our electronic key stopped working mid-stay and requests from staff ranged from totally helpful to brusk depending on who was manning the floor. Our one meal at the hotel was one of those experiences that had me looking around for the Candid Camera. My husband and I each ordered the ""Crosby Breakfast"" because it appeared to be the lightest and most simple meal on the menu (eggs, yogurt, fruit and bread). The joke was on us because the servers brought each item on large, separate plates to our table (muffins! croissants! toast! scrambled eggs! yogurt! berries! melon! jams! jellies!) They actually had to start putting plates on an adjoining table because there was no room for the eight plus vessels that arrived. I mean, I appreciate that we were getting our money's worth (at about $30 per person), but the whole episode was kind of awkward and unnecessary (not to mention an absurd waste of food). So, as much as we loved the hotel, I can't say we 100% loved our stay. I would like to give it another try, but I am staying away from the restaurant.","Atlanta, Georgia","Bouquet61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",142,5.0

We like this hotel because of the location, ambiance, décor. It’s a hotel, but the room you stay in doesn’t feel like a hotel room. However, we keep having strange experiences during our stay. For instance, after we checked in, the gentleman behind the front desk told us our keys needed to be made. While that would be done, we were escorted to our room by a different guy, which is usual, but the gentleman brought us to a room which was already occupied. He kept asking us if he heard the room number right from the guy behind the front desk. We replied yes. So strange. The gentleman then escorted us back to the lobby and talked to the guy behind the front desk. I guess they straightened it out and he escorted us to a vacant room. It was just weird. The first time we stayed here, we were stuck in the elevator for 45 minutes and rescued by the NYFD. Management apologized for this and gave us a free dinner at the hotel restaurant. Other than these mishaps, it’s a good hotel for location. Service is mediocre. Concierge is not dependable. They couldn’t help us get reservations to Locanda Verde. We worked our own magic touch and got in on our own. Water pressure is strong. Good lighting throughout the room, bathroom and closet. Great TV with HD. However, we had trouble figuring out how to turn the TV off fully. Amenities were great. They were good at restocking them each day. The hotel is situated in a pretty quiet location. I would agree with previous reviews the doormen don’t help you getting off a taxi with luggage and getting into the hotel. Also, for hailing a cab from the hotel, it was the same. We walked to Spring Street with our luggage and hailed one on our own. Another thing, our room rate did include breakfast, but it was not discussed on how that worked. In the end, we didn’t get breakfast. Overall, The Crosby Street Hotel is a good hotel to stay at as long as you don’t mind doing everything else other than cleaning your room on your own.","Chicago, Illinois","reviewer710</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,3.0

The answer is simple: the staff looks after you as if you were their family.And while the hotel is definitely a hip and elegant place to be -- YOU, the guest -- are what the experience is all about, not any kind of pop culture around you. Everyone from the wonderful managers Annelle and Kathrin, to Orlando the Engineer, makes your experience and every interaction you have, memorable. Any problem or question or need you have, is taken care of, virtually immediately.I have stayed in beautiful big name hotels all over the world, and have never had this kind of service. You see, it goes beyond mere ""service,"" because you don't really get a sense of ""duty"" here. It's more of a genuine desire to help make your hotel experience, and your life, easier and more fulfilling.I know this sounds bizarre, but it's the truth. It's kind of like, how you'd imagine you'd want people to act and treat you in a perfect world - with kindness, compassion, and an uplifting, playful spirit. You'll find this, and more, at the Crosby.As to the decor, I don't care what they are charging you -- the amount of money you'd have to spend to put a place like this together, and the details involved in creating such clean lines in an aesthetic sense -- isn't going to be made back in your stay, no matter how long you're there. Also, you should know I am NOT a celebrity, a heavy hitter, or someone who is high maintenance. I'm a guy from the Bronx who wears jeans and t-shirts who's done OK for himself, and that's it. The staff had no ulterior upsell motives in dealing with me, other than their desire to do the right thing and make you happy.Having said this, I don't care who you are, how much you earn or what you do for a living - stay at The Crosby for a once in a lifetime experience like no other.

The desk attendant said he couldn't leave and his manager had left for awhile. But there was another staff member standing right in front of the desk who didn't move an inch to help me.

On arrival we were not disappointed. The build quality, design and finish of the hotel is first class and echoed everything we had experienced in the past at the Soho, the Haymarket and the Covent Garden.But that is just one aspect of a great hotel experience and at this colossal price the service has to be equally fantastic. I regret, that with a few positive exceptions (wonderful welcome and good housekeeping) service here was consistently second rate.Twice in the morning we asked the concierge to make us reservations for dinner, twice they a) failed to leave a message confirming them b) failed to get is in to our chosen restaurants c) failed to book an alternative even on a 'just in case basis'. Generally we found the concierge service to be begrudging and inefficient.The bar service was surly and slow. When you are the only couple in the bar you should not have to wait five minutes to order and when you ask for the bill should not be told by the only member of staff you can track down that they are not your server and they will have to go and get someone else. That attitude is one of rank laziness and is inexcusable.These are just two examples of consistently slow, miserable, and attitude ridden service that we experienced. The sad thing is I know that they can do much better, particularly as Chris (Head concierge who was sadly not working the days we were at the hotel) is an old favourite from the Soho and is first class.

From home, we could not decide between this hotel and the Thompson LES, so we had originally booked 4 nights at Crosby and 3 nights at the LES. But we fell totally in love with the Crosby, and after 2 nights we asked if it was possible to stay for a full week at our lovely Junior Suite on the 10th floor. At first, it seemed as if they were fully booked, but the staff did everything they could and we ended up staying 7 nights in the same room. The room: Upon arrival, we were given a room on the 4th floor overlooking the courtyard. We are big fans of light and views, and asked if they could put us in another room. Again, staff did everything they could and finally gave us the most perfect room located on the 10th floor - great views over the LES, Soho and Brooklyn Bridge in the distance. Big window, beautifully designed, enormous bathroom with tub and shower. The room was not ready for us, but we were treated to a drink on the house in the lovely library room (hotel guests only) while they made up the room for us.The hotel is gorgeous - we love the Firmdale hotels in London, but this hotel really beats them all. The restaurant, the library room - every-where's quirky and beautiful and a real treat to the eye. The location is (in my opinion) the BEST in NYC! Restaurants, galleries, shops, cafes - all are within walking distance. And the subway is just around the corner.What really makes this hotel stand out is the staff - nothing was too much trouble... they even remembered my birthday and gave me a tray of cupcakes.The only thing they need to straighten out is the service at breakfast. The breakfast staff seemed confused and disorganized. We had to ask several times for EVERYTHING - But everything that finally did arrive on our table was delicious, and we had it included, so this is just a minor comment, but someone ought to help the staff organizing the routines at breakfast. There was a lot of running around and forgetting everything on the way...That said, we really did enjoy our stay and will not hesitate to recommend it!

The hotel did not seem exceptionally crowded. Many New Yorkers (especially local Soho residents) tend to leave town on the weekends, especially holiday weekends, so there were mainly tourists and out-of-towners around Soho and in The Crosby Bar. We came for a night away / special event though we typically travel for business. This hotel clearly strikes me as leisure and trend oriented unless your business is in arts, culture, film, media, etc. ACCOMMODATIONOverall: Excellent. We stayed on the 7th floor with views overlooking Crosby Street. The lead-pane look alike window is spectacular--one whole wall of the room, floor to ceiling. The window makes the room. Even though the design elements are not necessarily what I'd pick for my home, they are wonderfully done. Elegant without being stuffy, comfortable but also a bit witty. Heavy drapes, window seat cushions, comfortable chairs, superbly designed closet, solid cabinets and draws, superb fabric-covered walls. The bed was fabulously comfortable and the linens (in the bath as well) were excellent: Frette. Ample and well-placed outlets (rare in many hotels). The bathroom was floor to ceiling marble with high-quality hardware and a heated towel rack. The room was large by New York standards and feels much larger because of the window. And just excellent quality all around. Con: The A/C unit is loud and seemingly impossible to control or adjust. This affected our sleep quality (as did the very loud banging from a neighbor in the middle of the night, and the street garbage truck, but that's not in the hotel's control).DININGWe had dinner at The Crosby Bar (and have also had drinks there in the past) and drinks and lunch in the private outdoor courtyard. Again, great design in the restaurant/bard and outdoor courtyard. Comfortable, spacious, cleverly done. The food was quite good, particularly the appetizers and small plates (caprese salad, lamb tenderloin salad). Lovely, prompt and courteous service, though one of the waiters was young and a bit cocky and too casual (British public school boy?) The restaurant had the usual (for New York) ridiculously loud dance music on--preposterous, but certainly not unique to the hotel. We also ordered room service for breakfast, to arrive b/w 7:45-8:00AM, which arrived at 8:25AM. LOCATIONFantastic if you want to be downtown and in the thick of things. Right near terrific restaurants (from Savoy to Balthazar to Hampton Chutney to Raoul's) and plenty of street appeal. Crosby Street itself is one of the most charming streets in downtown Manhattan and is relatively quiet for that part of town. The curb appeal of the hotel is also quite high as it is set back from the street, though they could do more with the area out front (plantings, benches, etc.). There is a absolutely huge American flag hanging out front, which seemed out of place. The interior spaces of the hotel are fabulous design-wise and in terms of comfort. Bright and airy without being stark and cold.SERVICEThey have to do better. Everyone was friendly and courteous, though the staff seemed to be as engaged in people watching as anything else and they were a bit too casual for the prices they are charging for rooms. As noted above, room service in the morning was delayed, though pre-ordered. Lovely person at check-in but forgot to note: a) that the rate we'd booked included breakfast (and didn't provide specifics on how this would work with substitutions, etc) and a late check out; and b) that we'd need to call down front to get wireless code once we got upstairs (though we asked about this). Small issues, to be sure, but again, the overall feeling we got was that the service wasn't quite what it should be for this hotel.","Brooklyn, New York","bcc14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",1,4.0

The room is not large but the floor to ceiling window is an excellent design feature and fools you into thinking you are in a larger room. I applaud the use of colour and texture. The bed was amazing: firm without being hard. Same can be said of the bathroom. Quite small but incredibly well thought-out, from the way the door opens to the double sink to the ledge to put your toiletries on to the attractive fittings. The lounge reserved for hotel guests was wonderful as well.The only thing I thought the hotel could improve on in the room was the luggage rack. How do hotels think they can get away with putting one flimsy folding metal/leather luggage stand in a room for 2 people? Crosby Street, you are a smartly designed hotel, surely you must be able to address this(?) Unfortunately the staff is not quite as smart as the design. The keys they provided didn't work (they did fix this quickly), they were not able to provide (or really even understand the request for) a firm pillow, ie one that you don't sink into and suffocate. We waited 10 minutes and had to ask 3 separate people to bring our luggage down when we left. We asked to have a topsheet for the bed because we bake underneath a duvet. They did achieve this, but we had to ask for it each day for the next 3 days. On the plus side, the staff did seem genuinely friendly, with the exception of the comically bad waiter in the restaurant.

Hence, I had a closer look to their Crosby Street Hotel opened half a year ago and I liked what I saw … We decided to give it a try for our family’s stay (couple with a teen) in NYC.The Crosby Street Hotel is a middle-sized (88 rooms) design hotel in a quiet cobbled street in Soho. It is stylish without being too minimalist but appears warm and comfortable. All the rooms have impressing floor-to-ceiling warehouse style windows suiting perfectly to the Soho area. The junior suite we had was spacious (43 sqm) and tastefully decorated with top quality furniture and was going to a quiet courtyard. There was a very comfortable king size bed and a sofa bed for our son (unfortunately always bedded, I never saw the room with the sofa not made up as a bed …). The bathroom was large enough for the three of us, also beautifully designed, with two sinks, a nice shower and even a TV (but not with many channels working). We did like the room very much although there were some imperfections. For example the air-condition system turned off during night-time without our having a hand in the matter or the wifi did not work (even after we complained).As far as the public areas were concerned there was a very hip bar/restaurant, a drawing room where you could have drinks when you were looking for peace and quiet or in case all the tables were taken in the bar and there was also a small fitness room. We did not eat in the restaurant except having breakfast four times and this was good (especially the egg dishes, the sweet dishes like waffles and pancakes did not suit us likewise). The service was sometimes rather slow but as we were not in a hurry we did not mind. Also we went to the bar after dinner but as it seemed to be a very popular place there was not always a table available for us but there was always a place in the mentioned drawing room where we were served our drinks. Staff in general were pleasant and helpful, again – as with the rooms - there were some imperfections. They were eager to help (a late check-out was granted without hesitation and with no additional costs) but occasionally something went wrong. For instance when my son and I were checking-in the room had not been ready yet so we had to wait in the bar. We did not mind but when my husband arrived more than half an hour later (he had to return our rental car) the person on the reception showed him to our room whereas my son and I were still waiting in the bar without being informed that the room was ready. One thing as far as the employees were concerned I have to point out: one of them was really extraordinary and that was Stephanie (host in the restaurant/bar). We chatted with her every now and then and one evening as my husband went to the bar on his own he mentioned to her in passing that we had happened to get engaged at this very day 22 years ago in New York (we are Swiss). The next evening when we went to the bar together Stephanie arranged that Champagne and strawberries were served to us to celebrate this anniversary and there was a card added with kind words (in German), what a wonderful touch!Overall, the Crosby Street Hotel is a very good choice when staying in downtown NYC but it has to be said that as the rates are quite high compared to similar hotels not only a perfect infrastructure is needed (well done here) but also an immaculate service (not always the case).","Aarau, Switzerland","swisstraveler63</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aarau, Switzerland</strong>",103,4.0

You couldn't turn it off on your own. Then the room got too hot in the middle of the night and we had to call to find out how to open the window and tell them to turn the ac unit back on. It never went on. Our room was not cleaned until 4pm one day and they gave us a little attitude, unfriendly bartender, room service coffee served with skim milk (yuck- and we didn't ask for it).","East Hampton, NY","Twograycats</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Hampton, NY</strong>",2,4.0

Whimsical design lends a fun but still elegant atmosphere to every space, from the lobby to the guest rooms, even the bathroom. The service, however, was wretched. The staff appears to consist of 20-something hipsters from Williamsburg who have been forced to work because they ran through their trust funds. I really have to blame poor management here because there seem to be plenty of staff standing around doing very little, and everything seems disorganized. For example, service at breakfast was at a glacial pace (over an hour from being seated to getting our bill on two separate mornings). They could not seem to keep the buffet stocked. Housekeeping could not honor simple requests. The concierge(s) don't seem to be familiar with the city and seemed annoyed that I would disturb them from surfing the internet to answer a simple question. A call to room service in mid-afternoon went unanswered. These are not minor details and point to a lack of direction and supervision. This hotel's management and staff would require a major change in attitude before I would consider staying again.","New York, NY","uitsmijter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",22,3.0

Also, no one opens the door for you, which is annoying when your hands are full with bags, coffee, etc. I don't think the doorman opened the door for me even once, and the front door to the hotel is not exactly easy to open. Also, when we needed help fixing our TV, they sent the repairman to the wrong room (apparently) and it ended up taking several hours for someone to come to our room to inspect it. Upon inspection, we were told we would have to wait until the next day for repair, which was no problem. When the repairman showed up the next day, all he had to do was tighten a connection and it worked fine. He seemed surprised that no one was able to fix it sooner.

We were able to take advantage of a winter promotional rate of $505 per night for a luxury room including full breakfast -- not cheap but nevertheless good value considering the quality of the accommodation and amenities. Crosby Street is ideally situated between West Broadway and Lafayette Streets, just south of Prince Street, in Soho. After battling the crowds at the amazing post-Christmas NYC sales, it was such a pleasure to return to the warm welcome at the hotel and our comfortable room on the sixth floor with its view through enormous floor-to-ceiling windows of Crosby Street and the building tops on West Broadway. The hotel itself is within an easy walk of many excellent neighbourhood restaurants which was a plus because it was quite bitterly cold outside and we did not feel like venturing too far afield for our dinner. The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated with many delightfully artful and imaginative touches in the public spaces. Breakfasts were excellent. We had drinks in the bar on two nights -- the hotel offers a vibrant bar scene without being oppressively uber-cool. Bar service was a little slow but they were trying . Because the hotel has not been open very long they still have a few kinks to work out on the service side but it appears to be coming together quite nicely.

Overall, a gem.",Toronto,"Globetrotter1949</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",15,5.0

Room was quite large for NY, though the rates are pretty steep. Had all the facilities you would expect and staff were all very pleasant (more so i found than the soho grand where we stayed previously). Breakfast service in the restaurant was a little laid back (i.e slow), but not massively so and it was a Sunday. Location is perfect - paralell to Broadway in heart of Soho. btw - the burgers and fries in the soho park diner aound the corner are fab - you have to try them.","London, United Kingdom","Cerrig</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

The service was impeccable, the rooms gorgeous, unique and very comfortable (and a good size by NYC standards). Every room has been individually decorated and the cleaning standard is superb. The overall feeling was trendy but comfortable.We had breakfast included so took advantage of the fabulous breakfasts in the restaurant every day (although to pay for it may have broken the bank). Fresh juices, loads of cereal choices (incl several gluten-free options) and an enormous cooked-to-order menu. The service was spectacular.The concierge was always helpful and recommended some great spots (incl a fantastic fish restaurant called LURE). The location is perfect for shopping: you've got every chain store plus nearly every boutique imaginable within walking distance, plus it is right around the corner from Dean & Deluca--a NY institution. The metro is also very close.The gym looked very nice but we didn't use it. Same with the screening room. The rooms have blu-ray players and iPod docks. There is no blu-ray DVD library so bring your own. If you're familiar with the Firmdale Hotels in London you'll feel right at home -- even the stencilling on the door is reminiscent of the Soho or Charlotte Street Hotel. But that's no bad thing. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to return.","London, United Kingdom","lunasuperelf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

After following the development of the hotel closely (it only opened in fall 2009), we were eager to try this new hotel option in the downtown area, after previously staying at the Mercer, the Gansevoort and the Soho Grand. Our experience at the Crosby Street Hotel was very enjoyable. The design of the lobby, rooms and restaurant is very appealing (think modern british with modern art objects here in there). The staff was very pleasant, everyone knew us by name. I do agree in part with the previous reviewer, as we also had some minor issues which were resolved quickly. However, with room rates almost as high as the luxury hotels around Central Park/5th Ave - which also include Virtuso amenities like complimentary breakfast - there should simply be no issues at all. We made all the more challenging arrangements with the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, so I cannot comment on their efficiency. Small requests were however handled professionally and to our satisfaction. In terms of F&B, the bar is very nice, but unfortunately hotel guests cannot reserve a table (I usually like to call from the room asking to the staff to hold the next available table - this works perfectly at the Ritz-Carlton and similar properties). We never ate in the restaurant, but breakfast (buffet and à-la-carte) was very good. Balthazar, an excellent french bistro/brasserie is right around the corner. Overall a very good experience, we are more than likely to return.","Montepulciano, Italy","livefromtuscany</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montepulciano, Italy</strong>",41,4.0

It fits very nicely into the SoHo scene and offers a warmer and more appealing décor than bland competitors. However, it's also staffed by the usual 20 somethings who think they offer service but more often than not miss the mark. When I checked into the Meadow Suite for two nights, I asked if I could extend my stay for a further night or two. The young man on reception said he could not confirm that, but he would speak to the Reservations Manager the next day who would call me. No call came. I also asked for a second key and was told one would be sent right up...No key arrived. This was the start of a pattern of very uneven service standards based on many promises but little delivery.The Meadow suite is a standard two room suite with a faux fire place that exists purely for aesthetics...It's main attraction is a ""private"" garden. However the back of the adjacent buildings all back onto the garden...so its neither private nor particularly attractive. At the time of my stay the ""meadow"" was just a rag tag bunch of newly planted shrubs...perhaps in a year or two it will justify the $1850 price tag for the suite. However in the meantime, its just a big disappointment. There's a set of outdoor lights to at least create an aesthetic appeal in the evening. However, there was no switch in the room or on the patio. An enquiry on the first night about how to turn the lights on met with enthusiasm but no solution. I was told they would consult the engineer in the morning and get back to me....As you can imagine, I never heard anything more and the garden remained dark throughout my stay.If the Crosby Street Hotel wants to compete in New York and charge their sky high prices they will need to try much harder...Needless to say I did not extend my stay and won't be returning to this confused little infant any time soon.",London,"arrowby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",27,3.0

We literally experienced everything that The Crosby Street Hotel had to offer during our week long stay with my husband (who runs a company in SoHo), my two young children and their grandparents.Upon arrival we knew we were somewhere special. The staff jumped out to open the door not just the first time, but every time we arrived (hands full with children and bags).The décor in the lobby of the hotel is like being in a museum without the stuffiness. The kids were never told that they couldn’t experience the art (though we kept a close watch on them). They very much enjoyed the dogs everywhere and the staff never once seemed annoyed by their bubbly presence (nor were any of the guests stuffy about them being there). A very wonderful crowd the hotel is attracting!The rooms were just as amazing. So much attention to detail and very spacious! We did have a two bedroom suite (well one bedroom suite with an attached room for the kids), but even the grandparents normal sized room was BIG for NY standards. The beds were cozy and we enjoyed the black out curtains being from the West Coast it allowed for us to sleep in. The showers and tubs have excellent water pressure and we loved the products that the hotel chose (which is usually hard on my long hair). The blow dryer was even exceptional☺ Room service was tasty and timely. There were plenty of options for us and they even had things the kids enjoyed! Something I especially enjoyed was that they got to know us very well and on the first morning I asked for salsa (which they didn’t have). The chef immediately made and every morning he made it for me from then on. You MUST ask for it, it’s amazing!!!The other thing that we thought was unique to this hotel was the housekeeping. I rarely even notice the housekeeping, but these women were EXCEPTIONAL! They would clean the kids toys, fold any clothing left on the floor and never forgot even a glass! Excellent attention to detail.Concierge was right on the ball setting up car service for our different dinners, theatre and out on the town outings. They also were a great asset to us in getting dinner reservations and spa services. I was able to utilize the gym during my stay and found it very well stocked with all the latest equipment, water and towels. There were a few glitches that were to be expected with a hotel that just opened. The DVD player didn’t work well the first night and they had some problems turning off the air in our room for about an hour one night, but both problems were worked out and didn't even really upset us because the staff was so friendly about it. We travel to NY frequently and will only use The Crosby Street Hotel from here on out!!!","Pacific Palisades, CA","CAtravel39</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pacific Palisades, CA</strong>",25,5.0

I have stayed in lots of luxurious hotels in NY and none have come close to this fantastic hotel! When we got out of our car, we were immediately greeted by Daniel, our doorman. Also at the reception desk was David and Elyse whom we continued to have a unbeatable friendship with during our stay. Our room as well as the entire hotel was beautifully decorated and had a personal touch. The owners of this hotel did an impeccable job! Every night we enjoyed ice cream in The Crosby Bar down in the lobby and each morning we had trouble leaving our hotel room because it was so amazing. Also, the drawing room provides a fantastic spot for afternoon tea. Everything about this hotel is spectacular from the service to the linens on the bed. I know that I will never stay in another hotel in NY but The Crosby Street Hotel.","Charlotte, NC","crosbylover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlotte, NC</strong>",1,5.0
