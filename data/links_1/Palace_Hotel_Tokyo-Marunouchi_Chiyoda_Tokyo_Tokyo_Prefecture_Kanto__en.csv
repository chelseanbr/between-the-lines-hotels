Got upgraded to corner grand deluxe room - has walk in wardrobe and larger bath - with view of Imperial Palace Plaza. Nice welcome tray of fruit for our wedding anniversary. Room was well appointed with luxe robes/slippers. Large ensuite bath with best washlet during our stay in Japan. Nightly turndown service with hydrating sleep masks provided. Daily breakfast was provided with the FHR program - the property's Grand Kitchen had a wonderful breakfast - had the choice of a la carte, set Western or Japanese menu, or buffet. I highly recommend the buffet as it offers both Western and Japanese food. Fresh, quality, tasty, and unlimited! On property also had dinner at Sushi Kanesaka - omakase only; and dessert (a magnificent mango treat) in the Palace lounge with live Jazz. Swam in the indoor pool - swim caps provided. Well appointed locker room with robes, slippers, and shower. Overall, a magnificent property - great hospitality, location, amenities, food/beverage.","Orange, California","cyclopseye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange, California</strong>",32,5.0

We splurged and got the club floor rooms with the balcony. It was totally worth it. The club floor had a great breakfast buffet with hot options (pancakes) they brought to your table. The club had afternoon snacks, and drinks at night. The balconies on the rooms were the best, with an expansive view over the Imperial palace. I've attached some pictures from our rooms. The service was discrete and efficient. We ate at the kaiseki restaurant, Wadakura, and also at the Grand Kitchen when we'd had our limit of Japanese cuisine. Both were great. They had a nice wine list at the grand kitchen. The rooms were extremely up to date and comfortable. The bathrooms were gleaming. The location is right near a major junction of the subway lines, so you could directly get to many places without a change. My family really enjoyed it as a base to explore Tokyo, and we'll be staying there again the next time we visit. It was faultless.","Wellesley, Massachusetts","V340DBcraigs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellesley, Massachusetts</strong>",4,5.0

This is my 3rd stay at the Palace Hotel and it did not disappoint again!Although the gym and Evian spa could be upgraded, I thought the food and restaurant offering was spectacular. Some of the best restaurants in Tokyo are found in this hotel. My husband and I enjoyed the sushi restaurant, the tempura restaurant was spectacular with limited seating. Chinese restaurant was great as well.Location is perfect next to the palace, and great for park walks and fresh air. Easily assessable to Ginza area and could walk to shops.The staff were all very friendly and offered very good sanitization and hygiene kits to us. We thought the level of detail and room decor was very modern. We switched rooms in the middle of our stay. We had a corner room with a balcony which was amazing (see photos) but as our stay got extended we wanted to save money so moved to a room without balcony and it was as beautiful. I highly recommend the Tokyo palace hotel, it is one of our favorite city hotels. Designs are more modern than the Grand Hyatt.

The location next to the moat overlooking the Imperial Palace grounds is stunning and on a practical level, it is only a couple of blocks from the train station. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the restaurant is average for dinner (we ate dinner there twice), although the breakfast buffet is extensive and very good. One other thing is that they don't let you know that there are a lot of casual restaurants and noodle shops in the arcade under the hotel, down the escalator. Unfortunately, they were closed when we were looking for a casual meal, but it's worth checking out.","Bethesda, Maryland","Anna J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethesda, Maryland</strong>",13,4.0

We wanted something luxurious for the last three nights of our Japan trip and were not disappointed. The service level were top notch. The rooms were spacious and in very good condition. The staff at all level were very attentive and responsive.The location of the hotel is very good, a short walk from Tokyo station. Don't walk underground to and from the station though unless really necessary or raining as the underground network is practically a maze. Furthermore Tokyo station is an incredibly busy place with lots of people walking in a fast pace.Breakfast were great although the buffet spread is not big. A la carte items more than make up for it. You can also order a Japanese Bento box. Quality of food is excellent. The staff at the Grand Kitchen provides good interaction.A note for folks with kids. It is not necessary to add an extra bed even for two kids unless they are really big. Kids are children below 11 by the hotel definition. The king size bed is really large. The largest that we have ever come across. Definitely sufficient for two adults and one kid of average size. The younger kid can use the day bed. Adding an extra bed would mean that you will be charged as three adults. If possible get a room with Palace view. I believe the view will be great.

And this time we were very lucky to get a chance to experience the great hospitality in Palace Hotel.Initially we booked Mandarin Oriental but were recommended to try Palace Hotel by our friends. We felt so grateful that we had made such a switch because Palace Hotel did exceed our expectation.From pre--arrival, I had been in touch with the hotel and could already feel the excitement. Upon arrival, our family was warmly welcomed by GM Mr Watanabe and Director of Guest Experience Mamiko. It did make an impact of how you felt from the first impression.We were then escorted to two adjoining rooms which were perfect for my little son so he could run between both to look for family. He was small but did love the space especially he got to try many wonderful properties for his previous 7 trips.Room was actually spacious for Japanese standard and both rooms had a great balcony overlooking the park. Special amenities had been set up for us including a little dog doll for my son and also the personalized card printed for our visit to Mount Fuji. Lovely thought indeed!Bathroom was quite transparent to bedroom but could be blocked by sheer and doors. Other hotels always had the same issue where the bath mat blocked the door of the shower cubicle but was annoying but this hotel worked perfectly fine. You may think that's a little issue but it meant the hotel did pay attention to small details like this.I personally liked rain shower which was relaxing and this one also worked much better than our recent trip in China.It was a pleasure to enjoy a nice breakfast before the day start at the club lounge. Team there was particularly friendly and made us feel comfortable even though I was slightly afraid of the noise from my little one disturbing other guests. Selection for hot dishes, pastries and salad were sufficient for lounge standard where we could also order different options of egg as well as Japanese set breakfast.We all liked the juice blender where we could made our own fruit juice, something I didnt see in other hotels.Three nights stay at Palace Hotel Tokyo were memorable and we all look forward to returning one day, hopefully not having to wait for another nine years!","Hong Kong, China","dabawing</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",50,5.0

Yes in a second - it’s in a perfect location, great facilities, amazing service and the Evian spa - wow!Location Located right next to the Imperial Palace grounds, this hotel is only 0.3 miles away from Tokyo Station (5 minutes in a car and less than 10 minutes to walk) and 2.5 miles from Ueno Station (about a 15-20 minute drive, depending on traffic). The hotel is situated above Otemachi metro station (escalator down from lobby into a small shopping area that connects by tunnel) so makes it really easy to get to most places. We found Uber very expensive in Tokyo, not like elsewhere else it seems in the world, but in Japan it was normal taxis that were using Uber only, not private cars. We went to Teamlab Planets in Toyosu (only about 3.5 miles and 20 minutes) but that was as JP¥ 3,050 (about $30 or £24) for the single journey.AccommodationThere are various room types (Deluxe w and w/o balcony, Grand Deluxe, Club Deluxe w and w/o balcony then Grand Club Deluxe) and six suite types. We were in a Deluxe with balcony on the 14th floor with great views across some of the Palace grounds and the cityscape, with the Tokyo Tower in the distance. The room was incredibly spacious with an entrance hall (with stool and slippers to remove your outer shoes), a large walk-in closet, large bedroom and sitting area with a spacious balcony. There was also a large en-suite bathroom with a deep soaking tub right up at the window and wet-room style overhead shower, single sink in a large vanity unit and a separate WC with of course the expected Toto Washlet toilet.The room was serviced twice-daily, was spotlessly clean and everything was presented so perfectly - high quality Japanese hotels seem to offer every conceivable bathroom amenity, not just shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. As well as an amazing welcome (wine, mineral water, fruit and chocolates - also Evian water spray, hand gels etc.) every evening we were left pyjamas on the bed as well as a self-heating relaxing eye mask.Food & DrinkNext to the main lobby is the Grand Kitchen (open 6am to 11pm daily), this is where breakfast is served; either in the main restaurant area, the conservatory or out on the covered balcony. There was a fantastic choice of both Western (fruits, yoghurts, bakery, cereals, juices, hot dishes) and Japanese buffet items and various eggs and other hot dishes available to order too. Service was exemplary as was food quality, breakfast here was an amazing start to the day. On this trip we didn’t eat in the hotel (other than some delicious cakes from the in-hotel Deli/Patisserie/Cake-shop) but on a previous trip we enjoyed a delicious meal at the Michelin-starred (Chinese) Amber Palace restaurant - this is open for lunch and dinner every day - great views from the 5th floor and amazing ambience in the evening.Other than these two eateries, there are a number of additional choices for dining and various bar options too; all of the highest quality and incredible design throughout.Facilities & ServiceThere is a great indoor pool and jacuzzi, but our highlight was the Alpine-inspired Evian Spa, adjacent to the pool and gym area. We opted for an afternoon treatment of massage and facials, we were so lucky to have one of the couples’ treatment room (Mont Blanc) - the therapists were excellent and treatments couldn’t be faulted. We started off by relaxing in the men’s aqua area - here there was a dry sauna, heated baths, hot reclining bath and a cold plunge pool too. The changing rooms were filled with fridges of Evian mineral water and huge fluffy white Evian towels and oversized bathrobes. After our treatments we went to the men’s relaxation area where we were served herbal teas, dried fruit and nuts. What an amazing relaxing afternoon with superb service.The facilities in this five star hotel were second to none - from the deluxe in-room toiletries (Anne Semonin) and service from all staff (from welcome to departure) nothing could be faulted - we had another amazing stay in what is an incredible city. ThePrivateTraveller’s top tips (any areas for improvement?):I am quite a fastidious person but think I can honestly say there is nothing I would change here, or look to be improved!ThePrivateTraveller’s absolute highlights:The Evian spa - Mont Blanc double treatment overlooking the Palace moat and gardens was exceptional.Breakfast on the terrace - fantastic service and great food, such a good start to each day.You can check out my blog and other travel information on my website (link in profile), ThePrivateTraveller dot com.

There is really nothing to complain about. If you're a tourist - very accessibly and centrally located for quickly getting to all the interesting Tokyo neighbourhoods. The hotel area is a classical downtown that has literally nothing but the businesses in it. Not much personality - a very well run international luxury hotel.

If I were to return to Tokyo any other time, this is the place I would pick, although admittedly the Tokyo Station Hotel (where I also stayed and enjoyed) is probably more convenient to a train station.

No other hotel even comes close in this regard. Its strategic location at the doorstep of the 5-line Otemachi metro interchange station means you can get to most (if not all) of Tokyo's main attractions (e.g. Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza, Ikebukoro) within 20 mins, usually without even having a swap a line. The Tokyo Station, which is within walking distance, facilitates cross-country travel and is in itself a gold mine for food and shopping. So you get the accessibility and convenience to pretty much all of Tokyo while being blissfully cocooned away from the crazy crowds. Location-wise, this is as perfect as it gets. Rooms Refined Japanese luxury and elegance at its finest. Guests will easily appreciate the eye-pleasing living space crafted from the tasteful combination of space, great views, quality amenities, and the harmonious blend of modern and traditional decor.The crown jewel of the room is the balcony overlooking the Imperial Palace grounds and/or the cityscape. Similarly, this balcony feature is pretty much unique to the Palace Hotel so we strongly urge that you consider at least a balcony room when booking a stay here. It is a real difference-maker to your hotel experience. ServiceWarm, attentive, and efficient, with good command of English to boot. Get used to being greeted with warm smiles and respectful bows by the staff throughout your time at the hotel. This is Japanese hospitality at its absolute best. Food The Grand Kitchen offers a wonderful breakfast each morning, which pairs a comprehensive buffet spread with a special menu for made-to-order dishes (e.g. egg benedict with crab meat). Guests additionally get to dine outdoors overlooking the Palace moat. We can't think of a better way to start the day. Be sure to have breakfast included in your room rate, or you'll certainly be missing out on something memorable.Other facilitiesThe hotel pool within Japan's only Evian Spa is worth highlighting for its beauty. It is large enough for meaningful laps and remains lightly used for the most part, providing a refreshing respite to guests weary from a day in the bustling city.Overall value-for-moneyLuxury travellers are not short of top-tier hotel options in Tokyo. They are all excellent and for the price, the Palace Hotel is right up there with the best of them in terms of providing top-notch quality and service. But what makes the Palace Hotel stand out are all the features that only it can offer. We are talking about the exclusive location, the unrivalled views that come with it, and the unique balcony that brings those nice views to life. And we should also not forget its rich heritage - this is a hotel with a storied history that very few Tokyo hotels can boast of having. What this means in short is that you will be residing in a special place, and indulging in an experience that transcends luxury. Exclusive, exquisite, exceptional. This is the Palace Hotel Tokyo.",,720ricc,28,5.0

After waiting 20 minutes to check-in, I asked the front desk clerk, Kamae-san, why it was taking so long and if there was an issue. Her respect nose was ‘wait for some more minutes”. Eventually she admitted that the room was not ready and would not be ready for about another 30 minutes. We were escorted to the lounge as a courtesy and ended up waiting a total of 1.5 hours until we got into our room at 5pm.Once in the room and waiting for our luggage, someone barged into the room without knocking and then quickly ran out. We had booked under the American Express program but not once did anyone explain nor honor the benefits. In fact, we had to call and ask where breakfast was served, times etc.Breakfast on Easter Sunday was another awful experience. We were seated at a table to find dirty napkins from the prior guests still on the chairs. To add insult, the coffee was cold. Not once did staff even acknowledge it was Easter.

The Palace is a hotel for those seeking a serene experience surrounded by beauty. The grace and kindness of the staff is, in my experience, without equal. The attention to detail was amazing. Every time we got in a taxi they had the driver map out our destination before leaving. As a result of a knee injury I needed ice every evening. In less than five minutes it arrived,every night without exception.We had a club room with a view of the Palace Gardens and a terrace. I loved watching the sun move over the Fall leaf color at different times of the day. It was like a tapestry.I really booked the club floor for the combination of the view and the rate at the time. Little did I know that we would enjoy the experience of the club floor as much as we did. It includes a breakfast buffet, that is amazing. We had breakfast outside on the terrace with a view of Mt. Fuji on clear days. In the early evening we enjoyed wine and appetizers, which were delicious, overlooking a view of the city, so lovely. In the evening in the salon, on the first floor, there was a fabulous pianist and a great jazztrio. We were taken aback by the restaurants. We read quite a bit and booked several on our own. We booked a very prestigious and expensive tempura restaurant and were astounded that that meant all you get is tempura, no vegetable, no salad. That's a lot of fried food for $200 a person.The concierge recommended an Italian restaurant within walking distance and it was fabulous. We also loved our dinner at Madame Toki. It is a bit of a hike from the hotel but absolutely wonderful. The chef is Japanese but trained in France.

It really was perfection. The hotel is located in a quieter area of Tokyo, which we really appreciated. It was close to Tokyo Station and a couple of Metro stops, so we could explore the busier and crazier areas of the city and come back to the tranquility that the hotel and surrounding area provided. It was also a nice walk to the Marinucci Building and Ginza, with great shopping and many (and varied) places to eat. Our room was very spacious and had a wonderful balcony with a fabulous view of the gardens and incredible sunsets. All of the various amenities in the room seemed very carefully selected--beautiful tea pot with ceramic cups, crystal glasses, teak boxes, nespresso coffee machine with china cups, etc. The bed was one of the largest I have ever seen (much larger than a standard king) and was so comfortable. The bathroom was amazing. A large tub, with bath salts provided, a beautiful waterfall shower head, extra-large counter space with razors, brushes, tooth brushes, etc. provided. The staff, cleaning both in the morning and those who provide turn-down service at night, did not overlook any detail. At no point did we ever want for anything or feel that anything was missing or neglected, and turn-down service included pajamas and warm eye masks. I was really impressed by the level of service from the entire hotel staff. Everywhere we went we were greeted and often asked if we could be assisted with anything. We regularly used the concierge and one woman, whose name I sadly no longer have, went above and beyond what I've come to expect from this service. We had the daily buffet breakfast, which was fresh and delicious, with many healthy Japanese and American options, and the pastries rivaled any I had in Paris. Breakfast was served both inside and out and both provided a beautiful environment and was just a great way to start the day. If there was any disappointment, it was the dinner we had in the main restaurant. We normally wouldn't haven't eaten there as it was mostly western food, but we were there when a typhoon hit the island and we didn't want to face the rain that night. We ordered the prix fixe menu with wine paring, and the food was just okay, and the service just above that. The highlight were the wines chosen by the sommelier--they were unique, varied and just spot-on. The dessert was also notable.I also took advantage of the spa services and received a 90-minute massage, which was the best massage I ever had. I told the masseuse that I really wanted something deep tissue and she delivered(!), but checked in with me during the course of the massage to make sure that the pressure was what I was looking for. After a long flight, it really helped me get all the kinks out. Our only regret was not staying longer. We went to Kyoto and then spent 2 nights at the Hilton in Shinjuku when we returned, which was a complete and utter disappointment, especially in light of the amazing stay that we at the Hotel Palace.There are many reasons to return to Tokyo, but staying again at the Palace Hotel is certainly listed at the top.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nancy k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",10,5.0

It's a busy hotel with it's fair share of business travellers. In the evening the bar has jazz - a pianist and bass player - and a fun, bustling atmosphere. We ate in the restaurant in the evening and also took room service - both were of a high standard. I used the gym each day although for the size of the hotel I thought it was on the small side with just the average sets of equipment. So nothing spectacular here.If you're looking for somewhere nice to stay in the city this hotel is well positioned and provides great service - from the moment you arrive outside. As you might expect it is a very busy hotel and not just with business travellers - they had 11 weddings the day we arrived! So a popular choice for locals too.","Guildford, United Kingdom","Sue C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guildford, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

Its a fantastic hotel, only a short walk from Tokyo station and next door to the Imperial Palace. It has everything you'd expect from a 5-Star property but also a couple of really lovely touches that made the stay extra special.First was the Concierge (Mayako) and her team. This was our first visit to Japan and they went above and beyond in helping me plan in advance and secure some unique experiences. For example, we were able to see the annual Sumida River Fireworks from the Skytree Tower - something that was impossible to book from overseas and sells most tickets by a local ballot system. We were one of only a handful of foreign tourists there on the night. They were also able to help booking tickets for Universal Studios in Osaka later in our trip and were always on hand with advice.Second was the highly attentive service. As an example, we arrived early in the morning before our room was ready, trailing two tired children and looking like we had just stepped off the plane. Not only were we welcomed with a drink and a smile, no one complained when the kids fell asleep on the sofa and in fact staff actually brought them blankets to make them comfortable. This attentive level of service continued throughout, from the spa and pool to the restaurant.

I stayed in both the Club Grand Deluxe and then moved to a Club Deluxe with balcony; my assistant stayed in a Deluxe Room with no club access. The Club Lounge itself is quiet and relaxing, and has a formal and luxurious feel to it.Rooms are spacious and my balcony much appreciated, especially when it is summer. Amenities are good and though the room is a bit dated, it is comfortable and relaxing.I would recommend any of their restaurants. We tried virtually every venue. Tempura and teppanyaki, as well as the Chinese restaurant. However, the most impressive venue is their French restaurant Crown. A remarkable experience. It is delightful to see a Japanese Chef heading a French restaurant. Dishes are beautifully presented, the wine list better than expected and the service impeccable.The Evian Spa provides many treatments; on the two occasions I visited, service was attentive and my spa therapist was knowledgeable with excellent skills. Spa reception is careful in explaining the actual treatments to guests, and made good suggestions as to what combination of treatments might best suit my skin type.The Palace is for guests familiar with Japanese customs and style of service. It is a formal hotel as it welcomes many foreign diplomats as well as visiting royalty. Dress codes are enforced. If this is not the style one expects, then it might be better to choose a more relaxed venue elsewhere, rather than to be disappointed. I actually spoke to some guests who felt restricted and uncomfortable, and found the staff to be too formal or ""unfriendly"". I do not believe this is a hotel for young families.I would recommend this hotel to those who appreciate refinement and elegance.","Sydney, Australia","Grace S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",145,5.0

My wife and I decided to splurge on our last night in Japan last August, so we decided to stay here. Everything about the hotel was luxurious, and the staff had a genuine warmth that made us feel right at home.There is one specific incident that I'd like to mention, as an example of their dedication to service.We had booked a sushi dinner at their restaurant for our final night, we were departing the following afternoon. We had looked forward to it for the entire trip, and we couldn't wait to spend some time in luxury as we were embarking on our flight from Okinawa to Tokyo,however, this was not to be. A few minutes after take off, our plane had to turn around due to mechanical issues. We were informed that it's be hours before we could go to Tokyo. My wife and I realized that we would not make our dinner reservations and were quite sad to say the least. I emailed the concierge to cancel our dinner plans, telling them how disappointed we were and that we would pay the cancellation fee if necessary. This is when the Palace hotels dedication to service came through.Not only did they wave the cancellation fee, they even booked us a lunch at the restaurant the following day before our flight. There must have been 15 emails between the concierge and I as he kindly and patiently made new plans to salvage our ruined ones. The concierge single handedly turned an awful day into a wonderful one.The other reviews and photos here will show you how beautiful and comfortable the hotel is. I wanted to share what amazing service and dedication the staff here showed. A special thank you to Natsumi Kozaka. Since the day was so busy, I never had a chance to thank you...

As I came and went, the staff knew and greeted me by name, and were very welcoming and helpful. As many of the other guests have said, the hotel is very modern with elegant, refined decor. A calm oasis in the middle of Tokyo, adjacent to the Imperial Palace, right off the Otemachi stop (which connects to 5 subway lines) and about a 10 minute walk from Tokyo Station for the shinkansen and every other metro line.What I liked best that will bring me back to Palace Hotel next time: - Great, calming views of the Imperial Garden. I had a king deluxe room that faced the Imperial Palace, with views of the gardens from the ""fishbowl"" bathroom suite (with an oversized tub that offered a view of the gardens, if you did not draw down the power blinds).- Very quiet rooms. Not a peep from the neighbors or traffic on the street during my stay.- Super comfy rooms with good amenities. - Thoughtful turn down service, with Palace Hotel pajamas, eye masks that automatically ""warm up"" when removed from the packaging, and bath salts.- Excellent concierge assistance! The folks at the concierge desk (Mr. Kazushi in particular) were key in making lunch and dinner reservations for me at restaurants where I would not have been able to book on my own. I also received some great Tokyo city tour recommendations, including an ""insider"" sushi-making workshop at Tsukiji Market, which turned out to be terrific. - Thoughtful service generally. When I checked out for the last time, one of the bellboys helped me take my bags down to the concourse level so I could board the subway.- Terrific restaurants within the hotel. Sushi Kaneseka, two Michelin stars, is in the hotel and will also do a room service sushi box until 10pm each night. Tatsumi, an excellent tempura spot, is also in the hotel. There is also a Palace Hotel pastry and ""cafe"" of sorts in the concourse level for breakfast and snacks. Those were the places I tried and loved, but there are a handful of other quality restaurants within the hotel. Hard to go hungry if you prefer a quieter night in.- Pool and jacuzzi for the early morning and/or wind-down in the evenings.- Convenient location. Otemachi subway stop connects to 5 subway lines that will take you anywhere in the city. Tokyo Station is about 10 minutes walk away or 2-3 minutes by taxi if no traffic.

The room was large with a great walk in wardrobe area (see pictures). Normally, we wouldn't be bothered about a balcony in a city hotel but I would recommend a balcony room here as the hotel has open views towards the Imperial Palace and made a great place to sit and have a drink or lunch (see pictures). The hotel has a very nice small pastry, deli shop in the basement which was great for taking something back to the room to have lunch or a snack.Location wise it is excellent, just round the corner from the Tokyo's main rail station and the hotel also connects to the metro via a series of underground walkways (albeit it is a bit of a walk and easy to take a wrong turning). It is also directly opposite the Imperial Palace Gardens. We found it an excellent base to explore Tokyo.This is a large city centre hotel so whilst the service was not as personal as in a small hotel, we found all staff to be professional, courteous and helpful. The breakfasts were good (Western and Japanese choice) and you could sit outside (subject to availability) as well which is a bit of a bonus in a city.When we were there the bars and main restaurant in the hotel were quiet and perhaps lacked a bit of atmosphere.I would stay here again, I have not rated the hotel excellent as whilst it was good I wouldn't say it delivered more than you would expect for a five star city centre hotel.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Huntsy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",65,4.0

It is close to the subway/metro lines. We had trouble finding places to eat outside of the hotel until we realized that there were a lot of restaurants inside of an 8 storey mall nearby.

He immediately took the luggage and asked for my name. Then he led us into the beautiful and peaceful lobby area to check-in. The receptionist at the counter was very pleasant and the check-in process was quick and painless. We were also handed the details of the restaurant reservations I had made prior to arrival. The bell attendant then led us directly to our room. It was large for a Japanese hotel room with a beautiful view overlooking part the of the Imperial palace grounds. The roll away bed I had requested was already in the room. The toiletries were high end and each family member had their own slippers. Each night, with turn down service, a set of Japanese pajamas sized to fit each family member was layed out with a pair of new slippers. The bed in this hotel is the best I have ever slept on. I slept so well each night which is unusual for me. My family also commented on how comfortable the beds were unlike the beds at the Ritz-Carlton. Even the rollaway bed had a very thick mattress and felt much nicer than a typical roll-away. My wife also raved about the awesome and expensive hair dryer in the room. She ended up buying one during the trip as she said it was the best hair dryer she has ever used. Every morning, upon exiting the elevator, a hotel attendant was there to greet you and help you with any requests. When it was raining one morning, the attendant immediately ran to grab a couple of umbrellas before we set out for the day. The hotel is connected to the Otemachi subway station and Tokyo station. Unfortunately, it does require a lot of walking underground to reach the subway but you are at least sheltered when it rains. You pass the hotel's underground arcade on your way to the subway and there are several restaurants, Tully's coffee, the hotel's own pastry shop, and a 7-11. The hotel provides free bottled water and coffee in the room everyday but it was nice and convenient to be able to pick up drinks and snacks. The pastries and desserts were delicious but somewhat pricy at the hotel pastry shop. The hotel rooms all have unobstructed views of the city of the Imperial Gardens. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the balcony every morning drinking coffee from the Nespresso machine and looking out at the view. It was great to be able to walk across the street and stroll through the Imperial gardens. The only downside to this hotel besides the long walk to the subway trains is that it is a business oriented hotel. The majority of the clientele are business people but I did see a few families. However, our family of 4 including a 13 year old and 8 year old always felt welcomed by the staff and they were always very attentive to our needs. We did witness a family with a crying child that was asked to move to another part of the lobby as the hotel was receiving a large party of high level government officials. That father was angry but I felt it was appropriate as there were other places in the lobby to calm the child and not make a scene. Overall, it was a wonderful 4 night stay and my family cannot wait to return.","Irvine, California","DavefromOC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, California</strong>",11,5.0

Obviously housekeeping found it while cleaning and thought it belonged to us. This means they didn't thoroughly clean before we checked in, since the item was left after the first day. Housekeeping left us an apology and small gift, which we really appreciated. I'm sure it was an innocent mistake that led to an awkward situation.

It’s nearly impossible to find a room that is not affected by these two things (I tried - I looked at four different rooms) If screeching ambulances and loud drilling doesn’t bother you, then this could be a great option.

We looked forward to the nespresso machine every evening after a busy day of exploring the city. The breakfast spread was inviting and delicious and we enjoyed eating a leisurely breakfast every morning in the sit out by the moat. The staff was ever so courteous and eager to help. The hotel is conveniently located about 8-10 minutes by foot from Tokyo station and right in front of the imperial palace. Needless to say, we will be staying here whenever we are in Tokyo.

Clearly, the chef here sharpens his knife once a day' his knife being his partner. I strongly recommend the Evian Spa. Enjoy your visit. Tokyo is a FANTASTIC city.

I will tell you all of these things hold true! We all loved the hotel, it's beautiful modern design and the top-notch service provided by each and every employee.

The wait staff in the lobby dining facilities went out of their way to make sure we could eat at a reasonable time.

Rooms were completely insulated from each other and I never heard another guest. It has a pool for guests located in the Evian Spa. My biggest complaint about this property is that children under 15 cannot swim outside the hours of 9-5. I understand if the kids are rude or disruptive, but the constricted hours made it very hard for my respectful 10 year old to enjoy the pool whilst we were also trying to sightsee in the city.

Can’t recommend a hotel much more than this as far as the property itself goes.One piece of advice though: I may be in the minority here, but sometimes I don’t formally check out at hotels and just depart on my final day (if the hotel has my credit card, there are no charges to review, etc.). During this stay, we left around 10 on check out day to go do some sight seeing and left our bags with the concierge. We were cutting our train close and I told the concierge guy that I’d check out later in the day when we returned from our sight seeing. When we got back around 7 pm, I went to formally check out mainly to get a copy of my invoice, and they informed me that I had been charged with another nights stay because I “hadn’t checked out on time.” This wasn’t a trivial addition to the cost of the bill. I debated the point briefly with the front desk staff, and after a few minutes a manager came out and said they would remove the charge, but advised me not to do the same again on another stay. I thought this whole situation was a bit odd and it put me off slightly. RECOMMENDATION here - make sure you formally check out, on time, or you may get charged with another nights stay.

Exactly 5km. 5. Very nice hospitality team. Received simple juice bottles (wrapped with ribbons) and nice card for welcoming back from the marathon run.6. Stunning gym and pool. In short, definitely will come back to the hotel.

What really shocked me was a surprise welcome back from Hamano san at the Grand Kitchen during my visit for breakfast. I last stayed Sept. 2017. That restaurant must have thousands of visitors a year. This wonderful surprise, prompted me to write this third review of this hotel.I sometimes feel like going back to the Shangrila, because of the location , next to Tokyo station. The Palace ,besides being a great five star hotel., is also an excellent value. I was at the JR Tower Hotel Nikko Sapporo, before the Palace. That hotel cost about the same and the room was much smaller.Everything works perfectly for me at the Palace. The staff, room, breakfast, even the packing box I buy every trip is just the right size.

A notch above the Mandarin Oriental, we think, which is impressive. Book the CLUB LEVEL for an immersive experience. ENTRYA bit confusing, as you must walk down a long, large hallway past elevator banks to the reception area. It seems as if you are in a public space belonging to the entire building that is not necessarily just the hotel. Staff seemed more like they were guarding the hotel than welcoming guests, but perhaps that is due to the nature of the location? We found someone at the front desk who was very fluent in English and who made our initial entry better. The reception area is large, grand and very well furnished, but quite busy. (We were getting in a bit late, and just off of much travel across Japan on the bullet train, so our experience might be colored by that a bit.)ROOMWe booked this property from a train station THAT day, and could only get a 'standard' room for our first night, which was just a bit small, but luxurious. CLUB DELUXE ROOMWe were able to move to a Club Deluxe room w/ 2 double beds the very next afternoon ~$650 + ~$120 taxes, and worth every penny, without hesitation. Hotel staff moved our luggage and belongings while we were out -well done. 485 sqft, free WiFi (no lag, no drops in service), refrigerator, well stocked mini bar, small Nespresso-type machine, tea & electric kettle, luxury robes, slippers, even pajamas for the whole family, Egyptian cotton high thread count beddings. The rooms are generously sized with copious storage, utterly silent and completely dark with the blackout drapes, and have expansive city & park views -a restful retreat. Everything -furnishings, fixtures, decor, amenities- is top of the line, exceptional quality. THE CLUBThe Club itself sets this property apart even more. It is a tranquil sanctuary from travels and busy outings. You are warmly, quietly greeted at the entry desk, shown to the lounge or dining area, and brought whatever food, beverage, etc., you would like. There is also a gorgeous outdoor terrace with quiet, lush seating areas and breathtaking views. Floor to ceiling windows in the lounge and dining areas provide stunning, expansive views of the city, and park. The decor is clean, yet luxurious, with highest quality furnishings. Service is exceptional -never intrusive, but you never want for anything, an empty dish never lingers on your table, and expectations are exceeded. They make happy hour very congenial, and we had great conversations with other guests who became dining companions and friends.The club food was unexpectedly exceptional -absolutely fine dining, while ensconced in the quiet comfort of the club, with highly personalized service. The presentation, selection, and taste, all exceeding expectations. Individual items were artwork, and were displayed together artfully, with an array of choices, never crowded, yet never lacking -the sign of an exceptional staff working quietly in the background. See our pics of sushi, appetizers, breakfast items, etc. ... and this is just a small sampling of what is offered. The cocktail hour selection was also excellent with an array of choices from quality spirits.SPA / FITNESS AREAWe did not use the spa, as we spent our time experiencing the city and being with our children. We did all use the pool, which is quite large, with a spacious incorporated jetted hot tub and a shallow/ shelf area. There is a generous tiled deck with plenty of lounges, a pool side shower to rinse off, soaring ceilings, and floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows giving a breathtaking views of the city from two sides.LOCATIONThe property is located right in the city, a few blocks from the bullet train station (in a very, very upscale retail mall), and directly across from the Imperial Palace Gardens and Edo Castle. From the hotel, you merely walk to the corner, cross the street and walk down the entrance to the Palace grounds. The Gardens are expansive with endless gorgeous and varied venues, as well as the castle remains. It is immaculately clean and manicured, you are surrounded in natural beauty, and there are some wonderful views. A must-see.

As with most Japanese hotels, the room (including linen and towels etc) is clean. The grounds around (palace and moat) lend an air of peace and tranquility, and a touch of Japanese tradition.

I booked through AMEX and was promised a rather large room. When we check in around 6pm, we were given a small room. The only thing that was large was the balcony. The room was not nice and smelled of stale smoke so I went out in the hall to see if I could smell smoke, but realised that only my room smelled like smoke. I called the reception to see if they could change a room for us, the receptionist who answered was unhelpful and doubted what I said. She wanted me to check if there was smoke in the hall too or only in the room. I did not know what the point was but did as I was told and told her that only my room smelled of smoke. She then told me there were no rooms available and that I could leave the hotel if I was not pleased. Shocking service. She did not even offer to bring a air freshener into the room. As I was in a hurry to dinner, I told my secretary to deal with this and to find me another room at the same hotel while I was at dinner. But my secretary told me that the receptionist told me to move out instead since they could not come with with a room. I was horrified at this and decided to move out. I would not recommend this hotel to anymore. I cannot believe that the Palace hotel, with such a history in Tokyo would offer such sub standard service. I am terribly disappointed and will never stay at this hotel again. And to add, I was offered a coupon of $150 to be used at the hotel, but was hotel that I would not be able to use it at almost all the restaurants at the hotel. The only staff who were doing their job was the lady at concierge. She was the most courteous and was able to assist my restaurant bookings. A the end of the day, I moved to the Ritz Carlton Hotel, offered a suite of 1200 square feet at the same rate as a 500 square feet at the Palace hotel.","London, United Kingdom","FamilyTravel1205</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",33,1.0

Right next to the Imperial Gardens, with astonishing view of the area – you can see the photos are just like Photoshop’d and most of them are made with just my Samsung Galaxy S8 !We stayed in 2 different Deluxe Rooms with Balcony and let me tell you in this place YOU MUST HAVE A BALCONY ROOM! Simply do not think it over; there is no such feeling to go out on the balcony with this magnificent view, in this magnificent city!!! It is worth every single cent!Our two rooms were in the 12th and 14th floor and the view was different as the layout of the rooms but both were absolutely great.Modern facilities incl electric curtains, automatic toilet (Japanese high standard) multiple electrical sockets suitable for our European plugs and so on.Free Wi-Fi with very fast Internet service is available throughout the hotel. Not a single fault.The bathroom is fantastic and very big for Japanese standards, great amenities and the water pressure was just astonishing.In the evening you have free water, free eye mask that are heating and help you sleep and they had the most amazing slippers.What was the most important thing however is the SERVICE. The service here was even better than the service in some Four Seasons hotels. The concierges they were so brilliant that I cannot describe and rate them high enough. They booked me everything in advance. First class train tickets for the Shinkansen to Kyoto, all the restaurants I needed. They prepared and printed every program, provided you with every brochure. They are so polite that you cannot imagine. Smile, Smile and again Smile after smile. What a lovely people (as Japanese in generally are) .Bell service, waiters everything is running like a Swiss Watch (or Japanese Watch). Taxis are always available outside the hotel.Location over the Otemachi station and Tokyo station is really close within walking distance as well (few blocks away). Dining option are countless in the area and Ginza is only 1000 Yen away by Taxi.We have dined in the hotel in GO Grill (teppanyaki) the food and service is brilliant and also at SUSHI KANESAKA where at lunch the value is fantastic. This is one really top sushi places in Tokyo. We had breakfast every morning in the Grand Kitchen and is also very, very good. We had fantastic autumn weather and you could have breakfast outside and the good Japanese hosts were providing heating, so you could be comfortable.End of October and Beginning of November is really top season in Japan and we could see for 10 days how the color of the trees was changing.In 10 days we had only one rainy day so the weather was absolutely gorgeous. We use to go shopping in Ginza and Maranouchi, visited Robot restaurant (that is crazy place you can not find anywhere in the world), Shibuya for kid toys, Shinjuku for shopping also, Akihabra for electronics, Ginza and Maranouchi for clothing. We visit some great teppanyaki places in Tokyo such as Biftek Kawamura Ginza (one of the best steak restaurants in the world, Misono Ginza Kobe beef teppanyaki and so on. I have to recommend to every European visitor in Japan to hire from SoftBank Pocket Wi-Fi and for less than 10USD a day we had absolutely unlimited fast (4G) Internet for 4 devices during our entire stay in Japan. The devices even work in the Shinkansen all the way from Tokyo to Kyoto. Japan has Amazing quality of mobile communications at very affordable price. You can take your pocket Wi-Fi directly from the Soft Bank kiosk at the airport and also return in the same way. Another must for traveller to Japan is the PASMO card that we also purchased at Haneda airport. Basically this is one of those Japanese inventions that are super smart you can travel with that on all the trains and you pay on very low price. You can pay with the Pasmo in taxis, shops and so on, so the just like debit card. We are really happy with that service as well.We also went to numerous bars in Tokyo as we were enjoying with my wife our time without kids and I have to say the bar on the 6th floor Lounge Bar Privé is probably one of the best in the city. Superb service and drinks. We like this bar better than the Aman bar (which was disappointment for us) and better than the famous Peters bar (at Peninsula Tokyo hotel).All in all we had absolutely amazing time in Tokyo. We stayed in one of the best hotels, we had such a lovely weather and this was one great break for us from our kids. We felt like singles again and the Palace Hotel Tokyo surely was immense part of our incredible journey in Japan.","Sofia, Bulgaria","ivo_k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sofia, Bulgaria</strong>",537,5.0

When inquired, it was promptly returned along with a bowl of chocolates (as an apology but with no clear explanation as to why the bottle was taken in the first place). During our most recent stay, it was an aggressive interaction with the concierge that gave us pause. We had a reservation at a sushi bar (one we had been to a couple of times). We asked if we could make it earlier due to a work call scheduled for a little over any hour into our reservation. The concierge informed us that the reservation could not be moved earlier and that the meal would run two hours. Given that the cancellation fee was the full price of the meal ($300 for 2 persons), we decided we would go and at least eat an hour’s worth of food. However, the concierge “insisted” that we cancel (and incur the fee) if we could not stay the full two hours, because it would be “disrespectful” to the other guests. We ignored this, went to the restaurant a little early and finished our meal in time to make the call. Indeed, as we suspected, there were guests who were there before/after us and left before/after us. I don’t think anyone even noticed when we left. When we returned to our room, a letter from the concierge iterating her insistence that we cancel the reservation if we could not stay the full two hours was slipped placed under our door. It’s unfortunate given that otherwise our experience with the concierge staff was fine. We would still recommend the Palace and would probably stay there again (if only for the balcony rooms). However, I may be more inclined now to try out the Shangri-La or go back to the Peninsula, which is also on the Imperial Gardens and is more conveniently located to Ginza.Other things to note:1. The gym is 24 hours. The pool is nice.2. There is outdoor dining in the Grand Kitchen3. The hotel is connected to the Otemachi subway station4. We had a ""club"" room for one of our stays.

The concierge had managed to pre-book tickets for the Sumo wrestling on our behalf which we very much appreciated so instead of waiting at the hotel for our room to become available we headed off early to the Grand Sumo Tournament. The concierge also gave us comprehensive directions so that we could navigate our way on the public transport system to get to the Sumo stadium.

It is the combination of the best of western and Japanese hospitalities - from the design of the rooms to the staff - this is by far one of the very best hotel I've stayed in, and one that I'll always return to. The staff notices the smallest details- we decided to walk from Tokyo Station to the hotel (10 mins max), one of them spotted us when we walked in through the back door and immediately got another staff to help with our bags. After the check in process etc, we missed the official afternoon tea time by 10 mins, and when we called the bar to see if it is still feasible, they made it happened. Some context of why this is a big deal- Japan is very strict with rules and they seldom make exceptions. We are super grateful as this was one of the most creative afternoon tea that we've ever had. The rooms are spacious and we had one with a balcony overlooking Hibiya park. The sleeping area is clearly separated from the bathroom and lounge area - it's subtly done. Simple and classy decor.

The highlight of the room was the bath which was situated in front of a huge window so that you could take a long, hot soak whilst gazing out at the views. Breakfast was a feast, so well worth including in your booking. We enjoyed drinks at the Royal Bar on our first evening. Intimate and cosy, with just the right level of lighting, and they do a mean Martini. On the second night we ate at Crown, their French Michelin-starred restaurant on the 4th floor. It was a special occasion, and they didn't disappoint. See my separate review if you're interested. For our final evening the concierge recommended a traditional Japanese Sushi restaurant which was simply perfect.

The approximation to the JR and Metro demonstrated its convenience for tourists. The clerks were polite and zealous when we checked in. The room was modern and terrific; when I asked for kid amenities, they prepared right away. All the amenities were thoroughly equipped. The view outside depends on the location of room. However, Imperial palace was next to the hotel ; seeing the scene was a pleasant experience. We enjoyed the breakfast in Grand Kitchen, with a view of river surrounding Imperial palace. The food was delicious and fresh although the variety of buffet was relatively limited. I really love this hotel; nevertheless, there was an incident during this accommodations. I left my glasses on the bed but I can't find it when I came back to the room. I thought it might be wrapped into the bed sheets when cleaning, so I informed the counter clerks and the on-duty clerk visited. They promised they would call the laundry on the next day. Since I planned to stay in Disney Sea hotel on the next day, I left my email address to the counter and hoped they would inform whether the glasses are found or crashed. Unexpectedly, I've got no answers even after I left Japan. Prolonged use of contact lens made my eyes dry and reddish. It was so inconsiderate as one of the top hotels in Tokyo.

Sure for those who find a 15 minute walk too much to shopping areas may not favor Palace' s location, but hey it's a holiday I got loads of time.

They also put out Pajamas and slippers. It was a very nice touch. Most of the staff members were able to speak very good English and were all very polite and respectful at all times. The concierge staff were all very helpful with information, tours and dinner reservations. We had the breakfast buffet every morning. The food was fresh, good and kept fully stocked at all times. There was a good variety of many types of food. We had one dinner at the restaurant on the main level of the hotel. The food was very tasty. The area around the hotel is very walkable. I sat out on the balcony often and could see many people walking and running by the palace grounds across the street. Transportation is very easy. There are always many taxis at the front of the hotel. The metro station is a short walk from under the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with giving us maps and telling us which stops to use. We found the 7-11 under the hotel to be very wonderful too. We did a currency exchange at a machine there, and got some snacks for the room. The only thing that I felt could be improved would be more storage for clothing in the room. I do like to unpack and put my clothing in drawers. There was enough storage room for one, but not for both of us. My husband won and unpacked his clothes and I lived out of my suitcase. The closet did have enough room for my dresses and his suits. One other thing to note. The Wifi is amazingly fast. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with almost all aspects of our stay at Palace Hotel.

Because of the buildings architecture, the view isn’t expansive, but it’s lovely. Higher rate rooms on the other side of the building do have better, more expansive views. The rooms have everything you expect to find in a 5 star hotel, but the Palace does them just a little better. There’s a U shaped piece of fabric on the wall that the blackout shades fit into, so there’s no light leakage on the sides. Instead of a nightlight in the bathroom, a few lights are on a dimmer, so you can control the light you want at night. In addition to robes, the nicest nightshirts we’ve ever worn are laid out at turn down, and because we’re both men they put out two large instead of the typical large and small. The towels were amazing too, and both towels and nightshirts can be purchased in the shopping arcade downstairs.Food and service in the bar and restaurant were as good as the room.

My stay was excellent overall, there is not a single thing I could possibly complain about.My stay was not during a very busy time of year for the hotel (first half of December), I don't think there was a shortage of rooms. I was given a top floor room with a lovely view of the palace gardens and city. It had a balcony with some balcony furniture, and fortunately the weather was nice enough to be able to go out on the balcony, and the sky clear enough to see Mount Fuji.The room was quite large, especially considering average hotel room size in Tokyo. It had a modern, glass-encased bathroom sort of in the middle of the room, with a separate toilet and shower stall.My favorite thing in the room was the tea setup, with a kettle, a teapot, and a few varieties of tea. It had a Nespresso machine too, but I didn't use that.There were little extras in the room that made my stay just a little more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been: small snacks, and weather forecast cards (which perhaps aren't entirely necessary in the age of smartphones, but still). I'm also a fan of the robes and ""pajamas"" in the room. Basically, the room had everything I could want in a hotel room.I did not have dinner in the hotel, but I did eat breakfast at the buffet every morning, and was quite pleased with both the selection and quality of the food. There are US and European style options in addition to more local fare. Personally, I was a big fan of the small pastries. Not the waffles, though There was real maple syrup to go with those, which is always a big plus, but the waffles just weren't great. There was a different curry every morning, which was delicious, although I only sampled it because I'm not a fan of curry in the morning.The staff was excellent.The hotel's location is pretty good, too. It's walking distance from all kinds of things, and connects directly to the metro via the underground mall. Very convenient.All that said, I probably wouldn't have paid full price for this hotel. I booked through a third party seller because they had a special. I normally like to book with hotels directly, but in this case, that would have cost me almost twice as much! The price I paid was reasonable, but the regular price seemed a bit excessive.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","lotgottod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",14,5.0

We booked the Fine Hotels & Resorts rate several months prior to our stay.The location is amazing, just opposite of the Imperial Garden, very close to Tokyo station, Ginza and the subway runs just below the hotel. The check-in was the best we received in Japan. Super efficient, attentive and friendly.The room is rather modern and very large for Tokyo standards. The size of the bathroom alone is a full room's size elsewhere. Although the FHR rate may contain a room upgrade (if capacity available) we did not receive any. I am OK with that. But even contrary, we received an (obviously) ""accessible"" room on the lowest possible floor (8) with no separate shower - although stated otherwise for this category on their official website. Additionally all facilities like sink, tub, etc. were super low mounted. Considering the ¥ we paid for this night this was more than underwhelming and I am not sure why one would treat a first time guest this way.We both had dinner and breakfast. The dinner (main restaurant) was good and the staff attentive but not overly welcoming. We felt a bit alienated.After that we went to the bar on the sixth floor which has amazing views but lacked in service - we had to wait roughly 20 minutes after being seated to place the order, 15 more minutes for the (two) drinks. That felt a bit long for 5***** standards. The breakfast was also very good, amazing location and very good spread. Service was also more friendly on that occasion.The check out again was picture perfect, helpful staff, very good front office team - that's how we had wished for our entire experience at the Palace Hotel Tokyo.All in all the Palace Hotel Tokyo is a good hotel, but our experience and the price/value ratio was not.","Berlin, Germany","passportandpalmtree</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",42,3.0

It is the perfect urban hotel. It blends the luxury and polish of a 5-star hotel, while still feeling connected to the city. In many cities nowadays, the idea of staying in a typical large ‘business’ hotel feels stale. Tokyo; however, is a largely modern city noted by its meticulousness. Staying at a hotel like the Palace in some cities may feel removed from the city life and sterile; however, here, Japanese business men and women utilize the lobby and its restaurants for meetings, the host of restaurants on site, are top notch, including Michelin starred Sushi Kanesaka with its approximately 12 seat counter feels far from a typical hotel restaurant. In fact, in Tokyo many of the cities fine restaurants are located on upper levels of buildings in Ginza and other posh neighborhoods around town, or even subterranean (some of the cities most storied ramen shops are below grade in Tokyo station). The property also is connected to the Ottemachi metro stop, and is a 5-minute walk from Tokyo station which makes doing both business and sightseeing from the hotel a breeze. Also of note, the hotel fronts the imperial palace (near the entrance of the gardens, open to the public). Another great way to feel connected to city life is by taking a jog around the palace, just out the front door of the hotel. The property provides a jogging station with water, cool towels (for upon return), and maps, although the route is fairly self-explanatory and very safe. As an anecdote highlighting the level of professionalism on site, one afternoon I returned from a jog and was talking towards the front door. In the distance appeared the water bottles at the ‘jogging station’ had been removed for the day, as most people run in the morning, or were all out. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a bellhop running hurriedly across the driveway into a room. He emerged out of another door before I could reach the entrance of the hotel with a bottle of water and a hand towel. I would have been fine just grabbing a bottle in my room, but this level of anticipatory service is what the palace is all about. Another service highlight, upon leaving While the Palace has a long history in the Tokyo hotel scene, the current iteration is only about five years old, so its design is fresh, but one gets the impression that even after years have passed the attention to detail and high quality finishes will keep the place feeling luxurious for quite some time with artful touches everywhere, down to the over width guestroom corridors that while likely unnecessary even from a handicapped accessibility standpoint, lent an even more luxurious feel to the place. The room service food, Sushi Kanesaka, and Grand Café lobby bar/ and breakfast buffet were all top level. The gym and indoor pool are fantastic as well, and complimentary for guests. The only minor caveat I have is to use the spa ‘facilities’ consisting of a hot sauna and three plunge pools of varying temperatures, a guest has to pay 2500 Yen. While this is a great remedy to jet lag after a long day of travel, these items should be complimentary to hotel guests in my view as they really weren’t that extensive. If they were grander in appearance and offering I could understand the charge. While beautifully decorated with lovely public spaces, and beyond comfortable guestrooms with top notch technology, the level of design for the true design snobs is not quite up to the level of the new Aman Tokyo down the street. I was happy to visit the Aman for lunch and tea, two days in a row and take in the gorgeous sky lobby and view. I would certainly love to stay there some day; but even just visiting the lobby the Aman feels more pristine and museum life, and less connected to the daily life of the city. What I liked so much about the Palace was the perfect balance it struck. The Palace is a hotel that will provide comfort and luxury for anyone who visits.","Los Angeles, CA","Evan K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",98,5.0

So of course when I left my bags in the hotel and my wife checked in afterwards, they miraculously knew she was my wife and had the bags delivered to our room. Piece of cake!Of course, on the second day, the lounge knew that I liked my pinot noir and it arrived without my having to ask anyone - expected, please! But the concierge's figuring out what we would like and not like at Tsukiji fish market - telling us to wake up leisurely and eat at the outer market because, unless you're an aficionado, going at 3 am to watch tuna being auctioned in an unfamiliar language leaves a lot to be desired - that was useful. Location? Utterly fantastic. There are no less than 5 Tokyo metro lines that converge at Otemachi station which is almost directly under the hotel, which means that you are pretty much connected to all of Tokyo from there. If you're like us and you haven't figured out that tourists can get a 3 day unlimited pass for Y 1,500 at the airport, well the helpful concierge will tell you to take a short walk to Yurakucho station, the Bic camera store will sell you one, and you're off!I do have to warn you about one thing. The path back to the hotel from the train station takes you past the hotel pastry shop called Sweets and Deli. Do not, repeat, do not stop at that shop early in your trip or you are truly doomed. I don't care where you come from - the chocolate and pastries are sinfully good. I was reduced to eating a single dark chocolate truffle by the end. Look the room's alright, it's not the most modern room you will find, the hotel amenities are adequate - the gym is convenient if not completely kitted out, but the little touches and the convenient location, make this an absolute gem.","Singapore, Singapore","NarayanPant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",3,5.0

I was wrong. This hotel deserves all the praise it gets and much more. I have stayed at many hotels over my 10 years plus of trips to Japan and this one beats them all. The reason? Many. The hotel rooms are beautiful and spacious, leaving you feeling an immense sense of relaxation. The views are incredible and the access to a balcony unique to this hotel in Japan. We were so enthralled by the view that we purposely got up for sunrise and had breakfast in the room to take advantage of it. The room service and restaurants we tried (Amber Palace and Lounge Prive), where excellent. The spa is stunning and most of all, all the service given and staff is first class. Everyone was so polite and happy and they even waved us goodbye. We were so sad to leave and going forward will make this our first choice in Tokyo.

I love Japan - so after my 2 week Asia trip, I decided to stay in Tokyo and this time I wanted to choose Palace Hotel because of reviews.All the other reviewers told about the room and cleanliness, while I appreciate them, if you are a 5 star hotel, you have to deliver that. All Top 10 TripAdvisor 5-star hotels will deliver that.The difference between 5 star hotels is made by Senior Staff and Details. Because Senior Staff decide how to manage the hotel and details.From really below average in-room dining / breakfast, to not answering or 1h delayed answers to simple requests like extra cleaning material like towels, there are many small details I can share but this box won't be enough to tell all of them. If the room is enough for you, then please stay here, I sincerely tell you: their rooms are really nice.But, if you're like me, small details and approach to the guest is important for you - then you should not stay here, please try another top review hotel. You will be disappointed - and a few days / weeks trip you do once in a while and expect to be enjoy that, you won't have it here. I could'nt find enough time to write a review in generally - but Palace Hotel changed that.

The location is great, in walking distance from Tokyo Station and direct access from the hotel lobby to Otemachi metro station (exit 13B) which is linked thru underground passages to Tokyo Station and other major office buildings. On the hotel site you will find that it is accessible on foot (8 minutes) from Tokyo Station and we’ve done so, but if you have more than a cabin bag it is highly recommended to take a taxi. It is not so easy to roll your cases on the streets or underground passage-ways with lots of busy people around.Our room was a Grand Deluxe with balcony overlooking the Imperial Palace.

I would highly recommend a deluxe room with a balcony - the rooms are larger and the views incredible. Sitting on the balcony watching the sun set with the city and imperial palace as your backdrop is pretty incredible. We also had executive lounge access and although the lounge itself is lovely it simply doesn't compare with the Four Seasons offerings. More should be on offer for guests throughout the day. My only other slight criticism is the fact that the SPA charge you extra to access the sauna - there is no charge for the fitness centre or pool which are by far the best bits so the extra charge for the sauna and steam seemed a bit silly/unnecessary. It should be available to paying guests.If you want good value luxury in the very best location with a modern yet elegant vibe then this is the hotel for you.

The rooms are the most spacious, the bathrooms are over the top, the bathtub is opulent, the views cannot be beat. The bar near the lobby area is a special preserve of forest and lake in the otherwise concrete jungle of Tokyo.

Oh the food! Oh the polite people! Oh it's sooooo clean! Do try the toilets!!!Can one country truly be that amazing?? I had high expectations needless to say, plus I spent over a year planning and researching (that is even longer than I took planning my wedding!).We travelled as a family with two children 8 yo and 10 yo. Most places will not allow a family of 4 to share a room as the maximum is 3. I was on a mission. I wanted 5-star plus I only wanted to book ONE room!After checking out numerous websites I narrowed it down to 3. Palace Tokyo came up trumps! I rang them directly, the reservations person was lovely, very understanding of my requirements - one room with king bed and a rollaway, plus breakfast included. Despite the language and pronunciation barrier, they had my booking spot on! (Even some hotelsin Australia get it wrong)The rooms are luxuriously appointed, bedding, amenities, numerous tea & coffee selections and even a balcony! I believe that all rooms have the same view of the gorgeous lake and water fountains we had just based on the positioning of the hotel. Two swans (Romeo and Juliet or so I'm told by the general manager Ian Jordan) cruises by each morningwhilst we have breakfast at the restaurant terrace. Breakfast is a scrumptious buffet with a good western and traditional Japanese mix. We had the rice and Japanese curry six mornings in a row. I can honestly say that all staff are very personable and would gladly spend time chatting with you. They genuinely take interest in what you do and offer assistance when required. Nothing is too difficult and theyare always, I stress, always, calm and smiling.On weekends, beautifully dressed Japanese ladies and smart looking gentleman grace the venue. It's more business clientele on weekdays. At certain times of the day, kimono clad waitresses serve afternoon tea. The fact that the place is frequent by locals tells us that they also approve and enjoy both the food and ambience. They are a culture that strives perfection so we are in the right place.The Otemachi train station is conveniently located just below the hotel, the escalator takes you down where the famous Japanese 7-ELEVEN convenient store is located. There are also additional shops and restaurants around the area. The Tokyo train station which is the central station for all train lines and Shinkansen trains is just 10 minutes walk away from the hotel. Ask the concierge and he will direct you to the side door of the hotel which leads you directly to the the closest exit to reach this station.The main restaurant for daily buffet breakfast has four seperate areas plus a private room, 1. the terrace with fresh air overlooking the waters and to the right is the famous Imperial Gardens, 2. a glasshouse with hanging baskets with greenery (I'll nickname this the greenhouse), 3. the lounge with low comfortable sofas which is also near the bar and each night a smiling pianist plays beautiful melody on the Steinway and 4. the room where the numerous food stations are.Also adjoining to this is a private room which I saw was used forbreakfast meetings. I can't fault the food served. Juices arefreshly squeezed and by day 3 they have already preempted that I'd like green tea even before I had told them. Pastries are fluffy and buttery, I love the four sectioned plate (you will have to go and check it out for yourself) so that your food selection will not mix and taint its original flavour, there are many other dish selections if this doesn't suit your needs (I am amazed), the fruit bar generously overflowing with a good selection considering how expensive Japanese fruits can be plus others which I did not even try as I always head for my Japanese rice and curry. The chef serving knows me and we smile, greet each other and he sees me again the next day.Ian Jordan the general manager is warm and friendly, he takes the effort and time to check the weather when he asked our plans for the day. One morning he came by just to bid us farewell as it was his day off the next day. You can tell that he takes pride in the place. All other encounter with staff were also very positive. Once I had to ride the lift up to the room because the staff was so kind and had walked ahead of me to press the lift door open just as we came through the main hotel doors. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I was heading down to the 7-ELEVEN store as the kids were tired and hadwanted a quick bite to eat in the room. We had spent the entire day at Disney Sea.We also tried the Kaiseki (multi traditional Japanese meal - 15courses in total for us) and shabu shabu (hot pot with thinly sliced meat and veggies in hot water) dinner at the hotel. The meat had this melting quality in your mouth. Some dishes were too beautiful to eat and some we didn't know where to start as the beauty is also edible.The verdict: A centrally located hotel, top notch staff, clean andvery luxurious spacious room, good food, very zen indeed. I strongly believe that Palace Tokyo Hotel had enhanced our overall experience in Tokyo. We will definitely return.","Melbourne, Australia","Hillofgrace</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",93,5.0

We were facing the gardens so had an amazing view. All the luxuries of Asian five star hotels were included. A lot of attention to detail. Only quibble was that international channels were pretty limited, especially on entertainment side.

The bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious and the bathroom was brilliant: a huge bath, with separate shower and loo, twin vanities - everything you could possibly ask for. The Club floor I can highly recommend. It's a much better place for breakfast than the main cafe downstairs - very peaceful and pleasant. The Club floor also offers beautiful canapes and French champagne gratis in the evenings - something we enjoyed most days. The hotel has a variety of restaurants, both western and Asian, and we tried some of them, although most nights we dined out - Tokyo restaurants are fabulous: don't miss the opportunity.The location is brilliant - as good for business people as it is for tourists. The Imperial Palace is on your doorstep and the subway is below the hotel. It's very efficient and easy to use and will take you to all the sights.

The view - my room comes with a balcony directly overlooking a garden and the river surrounding Imperial Palace. The expansive view of greenery and the blue sky was pleasing every morning and city lights and the starry sky fascinating in the night. Something you would not expect to enjoy in a bustling city like Tokyo (attached pictures tell it all!).2. The staff - friendly, helpful and efficient. First, the young man who took our luggage to the room with us was very well mannered. He explained the functions of different devices and appliances to us in good English (a surprise in Japan). I was about to tip him for his good service but did not do so because I read somewhere that tipping is not expected in Japan (correct me if I am wrong please). Second, we asked for a few items in certain occasions and they were all sent to our room promptly. Third, we asked of directions/suggestions for visits at the concierge and the staff was patient and very helpful every time.3. The room - spacious and, as I mentioned, with a decent-sized balcony. Very clean everywhere (even my wife who is very sensitive in this aspect was satisfied). Two double beds sleep two of us with two kids quite comfortably - I couldn't find another 5-star hotel in Tokyo that allows / can accommodate 4 people in a standard room. The bathroom is of a good size with a separate shower. There is only one sink though.4. The breakfast - high quality, good variety, not too busy, and again, friendly staff members greeted us and helped with coffee and egg orders. Enjoyed the high ceiling and good distance between tables too.5. The location - very good! 3-minute walk to a subway station and 10-minute to JR Tokyo Station - if you know the direction. All underground. It can be confusing with so many walkways and platforms, so it took us 20+ minutes to find the hotel the evening we arrived by Narita Express.

From the check-in (room ready despite it being 6am in the morning) to late night cocktails in the Royal Bar the service is personal and friendly. Our room, Deluxe with Balcony, was lovely, both spacious and comfy. The windows and balcony on a corner facing in two directions provided views of the Imperial Gardens and the City. The room seemed to be serviced every time we went out with an unlimited supply of towels, dressing downs and pyjamas. It was great to get back every day after a lot of walking and sight-seeing. Neither my wife or I had been to Tokyo for over 25 years and really enjoyed rediscovering the city and its people. The transport is fantastic and you can do most of your sightseeing yourself, but hiring a local guide (from tours by locals), provides a broader perspectives and a few local surprises. We hired a guide to guide us around the Senso-Ji and the local Asakusa taverns. Food was a real highlight for us. From the taverns of Asakusa, to the local ramen, steak and tonkatsu restaurants to fabulous sushi and teppanyaki meals. The Concierge at the Palace recommended and booked Ginza Kuebye a sushi restaurant for us. This was a fantastic meal, not just eating and learning about sushi, but the restaurant is also a special event restaurant for the locals. We were seated (at the counter on 1st floor in the main building) between two Japanese couples, on one side they were celebrating their 51st wedding anniversary and on the other a couple celebrating their 11th anniversary – the younger husband (3 years at boarding school in Orange NSW) and the chef both spoke English and helped to create a fantastic experience. At the hotel we had dinner at the Wadakura GO teppenyaki restaurant. We had the Premium Matsusaka fillet beef menu – the beef and accompanying wasabi (freshly grated) was amazing – as was the whole teppenyaki experience. They also have a great wine list – we drank Japanese white wine by the glass. The Palace Hotel is ideally located for getting just about anywhere in Tokyo, there is direct access to the Otemachi metro station (just be prepared to walk a bit) where there are four metro lines going in almost every direction. Changing trains as needed is also simple with ample signage in English.","Sydney, Australia","SWKA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",105,5.0

The highlight was the Japanese sushi restaurant. Please make reservations because there are only 13 seats in the place. It is a price fix menu. The sushi is made fresh right in front of you. We have not tasted better sushi anywhere. Since we could not get into Jiro's in Ginza (one month in advance reservation needed), this was a spectacular experience in ints place. Kudos to the hotel and the restaurant for providing such a exquisite culinary delight. In the lower level of the hotel, there is a shopping area. Don't miss the sweets shop. It has excellent desserts and candy. There are some restaurants, a convenience store, a some other shops as well. Very handy place. As another bonus, there is a subway station connected to the hotel as well via a tunnel. The hotel is a great option for the luxury traveler in Tokyo.","Bristol, Connecticut, Usa","Thomas M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, Connecticut, Usa</strong>",36,5.0

They also helped me with booking a dinner reservation even though it was for a day when we were no longer staying at the hotel. When we checked in, the concierge gave us our sumo tickets and asked if there was anything else we were planning on doing and we said that we were planning on going to a baseball game and they offered to help us get tickets for that and explained the best seating areas at the game and again we got great tickets with their help. The concierge also helped out when the portable wi fi we rented from an outside company didn't work. The maps that they provide for the area around the hotel and the Tokyo subway system were excellent and clearer than the 4 other subway maps that I had! It was also very convenient to have the Otemachi stop in the hotel basement. The room was lovely, the bed comfortable and lots of space in the bathroom.

BUT, we had a free night on hotels.com, and opted to use that for our one night in Tokyo and only had to pay a little less than half what the normal rate would be. With that being said, this room was HUGE for a hotel in Japan. I had traveled to Japan before maybe a decade or so with my family (four of us), and the typical hotel room sizes are tiny. We selected this hotel because of its proximity to Tokyo station, and for having a view of the Palace across the street (and moat). We were only staying in Tokyo that night as we were heading to Kyoto the following morning, and we did not get into Tokyo city from Narita airport until about 5pm. Additionally, we would have liked to visit the palace, but we were not able to as it is closed to the public at 4 or 5pm, and closed on Sunday, which was the only other time we would have been in Tokyo heading to Haneda Airport.  From Tokyo Station, the walk was a mere 10 minutes, and check-in was easy. Upon arrival at the front desk, a bell-hop took our bags while we checked in and then proceeded to lead us to our room. Once at our room, we were given a tour of all the amenities within such as the electric blinds on the window overlooking the palace, the blinds to the glass window into the bathroom, location of outlets (international standard, so no need to carry the bulky converters), and finally asked what time we would like turn-down service.  After a 12hr flight, the room was more than enough to get us back ito energetic vacation mode. The only problem was that the room was so nice, it was difficult for us to get ourselves out of the hotel to enjoy the few hours we had in Tokyo.

Upon arrival, there were night-shirts laid out for all four of us, and slippers were also available - which was a very nice touch after a long-day travelling and hauling luggage from Tokyo Station. In the end, our eldest daughter (7 years old) decided that her slippers were too large, and that she would prefer the smaller sized pair. One quiet word to the front desk, and it was all sorted. Our youngest had Palace Hotel pyjamas, and was in her element when back in the room each evening.I have stayed here previously for business, and know the standards to be very high. However, staying with family made me appreciate this even further: the buffet breakfast was superb, with a wide range of choices for all palates, fresh fruit, made-to-order items if you wanted, and attentive (but not intrusive) service whilst everyone was seated. The Evian Spa was a fantastic little oasis - families are welcome to use the pool from 9-5, so best to make use of it before you start your day of exploring (it was essentially deserted when we used it mid-week).We dined elsewhere, but the restaurants looked to offer very good options, and there is also a small shopping arcade directly below the hotel, where you can also dine (more cheaply, of course!). That mall also has a 7-Eleven, with an ATM that will take foreign cards, so handy to know if you are burning through JPY cash.We got a discounted rate when the Palace Hotel was having a sale, and the full rack-rates will set you back quite a bit.

I did not feel they went out of their way to be gracious but the service was still second to none. The hotel feels very swanky when you walk in and because we had chosen club level we were taken up to club level immediately and given a warm welcome with herbal tea and cakes. This club room has amazing views over the Palace and grounds and is great for afternoon tea as well as glasses of champagne in the evening. The bedrooms are huge with massive beds and electric curtains which open on to a balcony with gorgeous views of the palace and its lovely grounds.

Wine by the glass selection was poor.Had breakfast at the nearby Aman Hotel to check it out - it was cheaper than breakfast at the Palace and it was infinitely superior.If you are traveling with a family look out for some odd quirks. If you are under 16 years of age you can only swim in the pool from 9am to 5pm. What international hotel does that anywhere in the world?! I'm yet to find it. We'd punished the kids shopping with the promise of a swim back at the hotel only to be told no swimming at the Evian Spa at 5.30pm. Just a stupid rule for no apparent benefit.Front desk staffer Suzuki looked after us with a translation issue at the Pokemon center. He did a great job and we were very appreciative as did the Spanish guy from Catalan in the foyer. Good people.So what does this point to? A discourse between senior management decisions and the staff perhaps? There are so many issues in room style, design and policy that let the great staff down.

I had stayed here before in 2013, shortly after the hotel had reopened but I had failed to remember how amazing the hotel is. The decor is classic modern - open spaces, lots of natural light, not too cluttered but everything harmoniously working together. The room I had booked had a terrace and while I couldn't fully profit of it because of the January weather (although it was a very mild winter, not warm enough to sit outside) it had some beautiful views to the moat surrounding the Imperial Palace and provided tons of natural light into the room. The room was incredibly spacious for a hotel in Tokyo and again, the decor and furnishings were understated yet very chic. Also, almost everything in the room is automated - for instance the blinds and curtains as well as the privacy blinds for the bathroom. The bathroom has a bathtub, a shower room and two hand basins (including a small TV embedded in the bathroom mirror!) and comes with all the amenities - from bath salts, to hair brushes to mouth wash. I am sure if you lacked any amenities the hotel would be happy to provide them.Breakfast is served in the Grand Kitchen and is buffet style - there was tons of choice and the service was impeccable. I had tried the sushi restaurant Wadakura on a different occasion and would definitely recommend it for a special occasion - while pricey we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and worth every penny (especially since we sat at the counter).I am sad I only stayed one night this time but I will definitely book this hotel for my next trip to Tokyo!","London, United Kingdom","Ayako A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

I suggested Palace Hotel as I had used this hotel last year for work, and was quite happy with it.We arrived via the Shinkansen at Tokyo Station, and after getting our bearings, we took the surface route out from Marunouchi North Gate. The walk is about three blocks down towards the Tokyo Imperial Palace. We could have walked underground too as this area is well connected, but I found navigation easier on the surface.The entered the rear of the hotel via the side walk that separates the moat from the buildings. Once in the hotel lobby, bell hops offered to take care of our roll-on luggage. Check-in was quick and efficient. English is spoken and the front office staff confirmed that our two luggage had arrived via Ta-Q-bin, and had been deposited in our room.The bell hop then took us up and showed us the functions in our room. The blinds and lights are remotely controlled via a console beside the bed. An extra bed was placed for our young man, and we moved this further up closer to our bed head so that I could place one of the luggage on the table. The room is good sized by western standards and is trimmed in luxury. The carpet still looks new and the cupboards, table tops and seats are well kept. The large cupboard near the main door could fit out large suitcase in it. It also housed the safe, bedroom slippers for three occupants, shoe horn and suit brush. Next to it was a cushioned bench for us to put on our shoes.The bathroom is an open concept. However, sliding doors and mechanically operated blinds ensure privacy for the shy ones. The bathroom has a luxurious feel to it. Lots of mirrors around the single sink with in-built lighting. Polished sand-coloured granite to walk on. A separate bath tub and walk-in rain shower cubicle. The toilet has its own cubicle and is fully automatic, save for the auto seat. Lots of bathroom amenities, soaps, bath gels, shampoo and conditioner are placed around the toilet. A hairdryer is also within reach. Fluffy towels and bathrobes are under the sink. We had a King bed and it was just right. Charging stations can be found beside the bed and on the long table under the TV. A large flat screen TV is hung on the wall. I was disappointed to find that they only had Fox channel for entertainment. Would have expected one or two movie channels for a five-star hotel. There are a couple more English news channels, though.Next to the TV, and in a standalone white cupboard is the liquor cabinet, the assortment of cups, glasses, kettle, snacks and fridge filled with soft drinks and beer, on top of the small bottles of hard liquor. Only the bottled water, tea and coffee is FOC [Free Of Charge], while the rest is chargeable.Free Wifi can be received in the room; it is a one-time connection for the duration of the stay.We had breakfast downstairs in the Grand Kitchen. My wife was impressed with the home-made jams and fresh breads. She was equally impressed by the wet and tasty scrambled eggs; just the way she does it. My son and I loved the ham carving station, smoked salmon, sliced smoked meats, fruits and sausages.We also did some shopping in the basement of the hotel. There is a bath towel shop that sells really soft and luxuriant towels, and a museum-like ceramics shop with a fresh and simple way of displaying its plates, bowls, vases and other ceramics. There is also a 'fish shop' here that specialises in serving fish dishes, but also has some chicken and beef. We had two meals here and quite enjoyed it.I like that the hotel's public toilets also have warm toilet seats, full bidet and flush functionalities and warm water to wash your hands. This hotel knows how to win potential guests over. The concierge team is excellent, particularly Ms Hashitani. She called ahead to the shops {Issey, Super Potato} that we wanted to go to, to make sure they had stocks; then printed the directions for us and/or the cabbie. The hotel also made reservations with Sukiyabashi Jiro on our behalf.The hotel has a perpetual line of taxis waiting for customers, and is also well-served by 5 train lines. There are ample shopping opportunities between the hotel and Tokyo Station.If you are sporty, the hotel's Evian spa has an indoor pool and a well-equipped gym, besides the spa menu. The gym instructors speak English. The hotel was kind enough to let us take a quick shower here before our late night flight. If you are inclined to go for a run, the Imperial Palace run route is quite doable. It is about 5km. Lots of runners run the route in packs or individually. The route is right outside the hotel's front door.We had a very easy-going stay here, which made it very enjoyable. The staff are all well-trained and have lots of initiative. The hotel environment is also very conducive to just chilling and taking it easy; which made it great for our vacation-base.","Singapore, Singapore","Jamie575</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",203,5.0

The location with its proximity to the Imperial Palace, Tokyo station, Marunouchi shopping district and Otemachi metro station with 6 different subway lines can't be beat. We also like that it's in an area that feels serene and calm - this is not for you if you are looking to be immersed in the energy and buzz of an area like Shibuya. The hotel has an elegant feel and the rooms are comfortable and warm. The deluxe rooms have a view of the Imperial palace gardens while the larger ones have a balcony that overlook the palace grounds and Marunouchi.There we a good number of high end restaurants in the hotel though we haven't tried most of them given the number of excellent offerings in the city. We can though recommend breakfast at the Grand Kitchen - when weather permits it's lovely to sit out on the outdoor terrace. The indoor seating is also lovely especially if you get a seat next to the fireplace in the winter. You get all the usual items in the buffet spread and the coffee is pretty good. Service is enthusiastic and efficient. The Grand Kitchen is also a cosy spot for evening drinks. For an old fashioned Mad Men type experience, the Royal Bar is highly recommended. It's a small and elegant wood panelled bar on the ground floor where you can still smoke if so inclined. The bartenders are smartly and formally attired as are most of the patrons.For running enthusiasts, the track that around the Imperial Palace is a very popular exercise spot. We have used the hotel gym a couple of times - the equipment is well maintained and of sufficient variety. You also get a view of the palace gardens. And if you have a few hours to spare before your flight, we would recommend a visit to the spa for a tune up.Extra points for remembering we read the FT and having that delivered without us asking.","Singapore, Singapore","lchan289</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",96,4.0

The Palace Hotel Tokyo is a blend of Western Eastern that eases anyone into the intricacies of Japanese culture especially if one arrives at 5 am. The hotel staff apologized for not having a room available at 6 am because it was the morning of a national holiday and after a busy weekend. They also apologized that the spa would not open for another 45 minutes but we were welcomed to shower there when it did open. We decided to start our morning with a walk around the Emperor's palace across the street, with the bellhop providing us with a jogging map. When we returned they apologized that we were few minutes too early to visit the club lounge for a snack. We visited the spa first and decided to go for a morning swim and soak. They rent swimsuits for about five dollars but the bellhop brought our suitcases up to the spa. The spa provides slippers, a shoe bag, lockers and many other amenities. At the expansive indoor pool you are greeted by another staff who asks what you would like to do and are graciously directed to a large rainfall shower to the side. The pool is slightly shorter than the standard American 25 yard lap with wall to wall and ceiling to floor glass views of the park. There is no chemical like chlorine in the water, it is electronically filtered and the pool water tastes like tap water.The gym is well equipped and also has great views. There are cultural differences in tapping control panels so you may need the assistance of staff to learn to operate the treadmill. If you need something do not hesitate to ask, it is likely they have what ever you desire.All these amenities were free of charge because we took advantage of the American Express Fine Hotel program. Given how expensive food is in Japan, you may want to consider this if you are traveling with a growing adolescent boy. The club lounge provides a light multicultural breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés.The rooms are generously sized even by American standards but unfortunately the hotel does not allow more than 3 to a room if your children are above age six. The website gives a good detailed accounting of room amenities but somethings worth mentioning include Japanese pajamas in addition to robes and slippers. The most luxurious rainfall shower head will make you feel a tad bit guilty. Powered curtains are floor to ceiling and wall to wall so you may never realize it is morning. Sensors detect when you enter the room for temperature control and the lights: room may feel warm when you enter but the air conditioning will start to cool the room down quickly. Most of the hotel runs warm for American tastes especially during Cool season.The interiors were renovated in 2012 with dark, modern Asian tones and dark wood. Areas are sectioned by automatic glass partitions which create an incredibly quiet ambiance even in the expansive spaces. The balcony rooms overlooking the moat and garden are definitely worth the extra cost because of the views, since there is little greenery in Tokyo. Our room on the south side had a view of Mt Fuji on a clear morning. This was a free upgrade with Amex program. The club lounge situated on the 19th floor may have views of Mt Fuji on a clear morning if the fog abated. Traveling in Japan remains daunting and making pre travel arrangements to popular destinations like Studio Ghibli was difficult and ""sold out"" per web but the concierge service was extremely helpful via email obtaining tickets, arranging private tour guides, and recommending signing up on the web for the tour of the Emperor's palace. Our all inclusive package included daily buffet breakfast in the main restaurant. The service was top notch and food selection multicultural. I would definitely try all the different meat offerings since meat in Japan tends to be expensive but also quite different from American meat. The eggs and chicken tasted like free range raised on natural feed. Our son noticed that the yolks were much more orange which is the signature of chickens fed a natural diet. Since our rooms also include a $100 food credit, we mistakenly decide to try ""Go"" for lunch. Let's just say that one 40 gram mushroom costs $20. We could have done the $90 prix fix seven course lunch for less than what we spent but it was good to choose what we wanted especially if you are trying to stick to a low carb diet. Watching them make the fried garlic rice was entertaining but the extra calories are better saved for dessert. Despite the cost, it was worth the unique cultural experience of having an almost private room with your own personal chef, making art from small pieces of mushrooms, vegetables, beef and prawns. If you like shrimp with the head on, I highly recommend the prawn. The chef carefully carved a single large prawn and sautéed the head to crisp perfection, served with a small side of greens, mushroom and rich butter anchovy sauce. Afterwards you can head to the club lounge and finish feeding your adolescent boy.The hotel offers an all around spa resort experience with impressive Japanese attention to details and service. The English fluency of most of the staff insures a stress free vacation. The Concierge staff's knowledge of accessing events and special tours is well worth the 10 percent surcharge especially since credit cards are still not widely accepted for certain transactions.","Sacramento, California","blue1966davis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",31,5.0

You have to either use the master key near the entrance and then walk through the darkness back to bed or turn off lights one by one. Very rare design default for a hotel at this level. This is the only reason for it to be marked as 'very good' but not 'excellent'. Hope the hotel will be able to find a way to fix it. ",,Tony Z,84,4.0

We considered the Imperial Palace Hotel but in the end decided to go for the Palace Hotel as it's much newer and based on all the reviews we have read so far, they have nothing but praise for this noteworthy property.Our first impression upon arrival was that it has ""WOW"" factor in terms of the location which is very green and the grand lobby entrance. We booked the Club Deluxe Twin room with balcony overlooking the spectacular park. All the amenities were spotlessly clean and located in the right spots, especially electrical sockets.The furnishing in the room is very 'ZEN' without feeling spartan. The balcony is the pièce de ré·sis·tance as it is very spacious and could easily sit 6 people or more; rarity in Tokyo hotels. The concierge and front desk were extremely efficient when a request was made. It was not just the efficiency that impressed us but the level of courtesy extended to us. Apart from explaining some directions we were inquiring about, one of the nice ladies from concierge even escorted us to the hotel's taxi stand and explained to the driver where we were headed. That was service well and beyond our expectations. Our summation is that this property have invested heavily in training their staff.The Club Lounge located high in the building is well presented and maintained. The art decor furniture is new and comfortable and the views from the lounge overlooking the park are to die for. It also afforded an outside garden area but nobody used it on this occasion as it was rather windy and the weather was not so conducive. The staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much to ask for. On a more critical note, we found the breakfast selection in the Club Lounge to be quite disappointing and without any variations everyday in terms of variety. One can also order cooked meals but there was no menu to show what is available. It would be great if they can introduce a little menu on the table so that the guests know what options are available apart from the buffet spread. Generally we found the selection of food to be small even for the cocktail hour and afternoon tea.I was surprised that Club Floors guests were charged 300 Yen for 15 minutes of internet usage on their PC and 150 yen to print a sheet of paper in color. That is a highly unusual practice. I have never come across this anomaly with all the hotels I have stayed in. Whenever one chooses the club floor, one automatically assumes all these facilities are complimentary. Perhaps they need to consider changing it. Most people use the free wifi anyway, so I see no point in making the guests feel awkward in this area.We ate twice at the Grand Kitchen for dinner. The ambiance is reminiscent of a French/Italian eatery. The great height of the ceiling made it feel very opulent and grand with several different and nice seating areas to choose from. We particularly love the huge and long fireplace. The only disappointment was that the food was quite bland and tasteless. We had the set menu which cost around 7600 plus yen per person. My Cesare Salad, Mushroom Soup and Fish main course were terribly disappointing in terms of taste and presentation. My companion also made the same observation with his food selection. On the second evening we ordered from the ala carte menu and the duck confit was a huge improvement over the previous evening. However the staff were extremely well trained and helpful to us on both evenings.Having said that, these are only 3 very small 'improvements' I would suggest. This hotel is as perfect as a hotel can be. I would definitely not hesitate to stay there on my next visit and highly recommend it to anyone.",United Kingdom,"Khylune T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",152,5.0

It was great relief to have a nice cool drink after a long drive from Narita Airport to Central Tokyo. My wife love the afternoon tea and the evening cocktail very much. The staff were wonderful. One more benefit for staying at the Club floor is that parking is complimentary. Yes its free to park your car in the centre of Tokyo!The location can be a disadvantage if JR is your main mode of transportation. I tried to walk to Tokyo station through the underground tunnels. This is not something enjoyable. However if you use the Metro then that will be another story because the hotel is directly connected to Otemachi station which is served by 6 Metro lines.

There is separate shower and tub. The gym is small but empty the few times I visited. The breakfast buffet is extensive with a good selection of western and japanese items. There is seating available outside. I really loved this hotel from the artwork in the lobby to the rooms.

My two criteria were to have an amazing buffet breakfast and a pool. This place ticked both my wishes. Firstly the buffet breakfast is amazing and especially for its western style offerings which included a egg station ; omelettes, poached, fried whatever you like, smoothie/juice bar, pastry and breads, waffles etc and inclusive coffee from the coffee machines. The only thing I had wished for was a pancake or crepe station and possibly having chai lattes (Melbourne style) but you can't have everything.Secondly the pool was slightly disappointing especially as I was dreamed of splashing in cool waters and instead it was 35 degrees, so no swim for me unfortunately, but my husband did use it once and said the view from the indoor pool was special.The rest of the hotel is pretty lovely, the lobby smells divine all the time, and there are comfy couch areas to sit if you need a break. There are water bottles on leaving which was handy in 35 degree heat and of course 2 free bottles each day in your room. There are always 5-10 people greeting or farewelling you as you walk through the lobby which can be a little annoying and I wonder what these people are meant to do. As tourists we did feel a little out of place when dressed casually and heading out to see tokyo as it is largely a business orientated hotel. But our money is as good as anyone else's so we didn't let it bother us. The room we had was pretty special with a balcony with spectacular views by day and night, two large single beds and a bathroom that could be closed off or open with bath, separate rain shower.The concierge and reception speak impeccable english and helped us with a few recommendations. Even booking a Sumo training training tour on our last day - which by the way was unreal.Room service was good and one day not feeling like heading back out for dinner we got a burger and pasta which were a good as any mid-range restaurant back home.Handy location to metro and a 7-eleven in the base of the building and various shopping malls - mostly underground. A good find was Serafino the pizza and pasta place - handy after several crazings for western food.","Melbourne, Australia","Dee_Kiss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",81,5.0

You're paying for its worth. The room was of pretty reasonable size, bathroom was big with a nice bathtub. The water pressure is one of the BEST I've had in any hotels (I still miss it lol). The staff service was excellent, they're forever smiling, attentive and make sure you feel welcomed. Truly 5 star service. It's about 5-8 mins walk to the Otemachi metro station via an under passage or maybe 10-12 mins walk to the JR Tokyo station. I would say however if you are arriving into Tokyo JR station with luggage then the walk to the hotel might be a bit demanding for some. I would recommend taking a taxi which would probably only cost you the basic meter fare of 730yen. Trust the other reviews when they said breakfast is not that good. I had room service for breakfast one morning and was quite disappointed at the quality. I stayed in the room that doesn't have a balcony, even though they say you get the 'palace view' you're really facing it at such a strange angle that there's barely any 'view'. I read other reviews highly recommending paying extra for a room with balcony or ask for a room on higher floor, I completely agree with both. Due to flight reasons I was delayed for a day and end up having to stay one more night after I've already checked out of my old room. I was given a room 38 on a slightly higher floor but was a bit disappointed that this room is actually quite a bit smaller than the rest of the rooms of the same type (all under the same price tag of course). I guess for others who's there for the first time they may not realize the difference but I've just stayed in another room for the past 5 nights so it was a rather big difference to me. I just think if the hotel is charging every one of these rooms at the same price there shouldn't be one that's probably 10-20% smaller than the rest.. But having said that, the 'smaller room' is already above your average hotel room size in Japan and I would still highly recommend this hotel to anyone.","Hong Kong, China","HappyHajara</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",35,5.0

In the very impressive Japanese way, every single detail has been thought out in the design and service at this beautiful hotel. Be sure to read up on the artwork in the hotel in the coffee table book in your room and take the time to walk around and appreciate the art. Some gorgeous work. I came to Tokyo for a business trip and for the business leg stayed in a super efficient little inn in Yokohama. Being my first time to Japan I thought I would indulge myself for the weekend I added to my trip to see a little of Tokyo. Selecting this hotel was ideal as you are located right next to the Imperial Palace and you feel like you are in a Palace. Overlooking the Imperial Palace Gardens, you can walk out the door and stroll or take the jogging trail right around the Palace admiring it's beauty. The jogging trail is 5.3kms (3.3 miles) round trip. Be sure to jog anti-clockwise to go with the flow. Alternatively there is a shorter course and walking tours of the Palace itself you can take. It really is a green oasis in a big city. There is a Tokyo metro station accessible from an escalator in the Palace Hotel, making it easy to get around. Tokyo jr Station to catch the bullet train to and from the hotel to the airport or further out is only an 8 minute walk. I had a big suitcase and the hotel said it is fine to catch a taxi that short distance too. Just have cash though as it really is a short distance. Maps provided by the concierge and their advice on where to go and what to do is really valuable. If you want to do the fish market tour and sushi making lesson though, book in advance and note that the market is closed on Sunday. Was bummed I missed out on this experience. Staying in a Club Room I had access to the Club Lounge and the benefits are extensive. The breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktail hours - food and beverages and service are exceptional. Being a wine lover it can be a little difficult to get a really nice glass of wine at a lot of the casual restaurants around town, so to come back to the hotel after a day out and about and be offered up a really beautiful, bottomless glass of wine in the Club Lounge, alongside delicious canapés, was heavenly. If you are a light eater you really wouldn't need dinner after cocktail hour which runs from 5.30pm to 8pm. Booking a Club Room is worth every cent. The amenities in the room are top notch. you feel like you are in a luxury spa in your bathroom. The language barrier can be a challenge in many places so to have a hotel team that speak English really well is invaluable in helping you prepare and navigate the rest of your activities. As a female travelling on my own I felt so comfortable and well looked after here.

I have stayed at several 5-star hotel club rooms and there is usually a choice of lounge or main restaurant for breakfast. I was really looking forward to the food selections of the lounge, but it seemed to be lacking compared to the Conrad Tokyo. The lounge at the Conrad is much smaller,but has hot food during the cocktail hour and surprisingly ice cream during tea time.. I do not drink, so the value of alcohol is wasted on me. I enjoy club lounges mainly for the food and a nice quiet place to return for a juice or soda after a day out in the city.I also feel it would be nice if they could recognize past guests.

There was no non-slippery pad provided by the hotel and he slipped down right in front of his dad watching him! He was seriously hit in the back head and bleeding. Hotel staff called ambulance which took us to a nearly hospital for emergency care. Fortunately with God bless, my boy was stable after doctor check up and several stitches on head. After we returned to hotel from hospital, I asked the hotel to bring in the non-slippery pad for the rest of our stay. And that's all the hotel did after this incident. There was no consolation and further checking in on my son's situation. there was certainly no apology. The next day, per our request, we set up a meeting with the housekeeping manager, and gave them the hospital bill (which btw was only a bit more than 1-night cost in this hotel). I thought it's fair that the hotel should take some responsibility for failing to keep guests safe and having flaws in its facility supply. To our greatest surprise, the first response from the hotel after 8 hours consideration was that they refused to take any responsibility and they agreed only to take out 10% service charge as a courtesy. I must say, this was beyond my imagination to have such a cold and arrogant feedback from a Japanese 5-star hotel well-known for its service!!! The next day, as I filed a complaint via my hotel booking agent, the hotel vice general manage met me again and raised his offer a little bit more than 10% service charge. I was very disappointed and angry that they treat this with such an annoying attitude. They made it look like we were exchanging our son's pain for just a little penny money! It's their cold attitude and lack of sympathy hurts us the most. The vice GM did not even bother to give us his name card during our two conversations, which to our knowledge, is extremely disrespectful in Japanese culture. We checked out on the 3rd day and paid our full bill. During the checking out, no staff came up and said any apology words to us. We just left with a heavy heart full of disappointment.

We selected a Club Deluxe Room with balcony as we find the facilities in the 'Club' rooms in hotels to be very useful when we are touring. The room itself was pretty spacious, with an excellent range of amenities and a wide view from the 22nd floor over the Palace Gardens towards the city and Mt.Fuji (we were lucky enough to see it on most days).The location for us was excellent - a few minutes walk to Tokyo JR Station, a direct subway connection to Otemachi station, which is one of the best connected subway stations, and within walking distance of Ginza. We really enjoyed our 7 night stay, in fact we are back there for another short stay in a couple of weeks time.All of the staff were absolutely charming, though on the Club floor perhaps not as sharp as one finds in the hotels named above, but I put some of this down to language difficulties. One young lady from the 6th Floor Restaurants - Christine I think - spent some considerable time with us, adapting the menus in the Teppanyaki and Tempura for two meals we had there, to cater for our dietary needs. She was absolutely superb, as was the lady who served us on both occasions - thank you.The one element that we thought was lacking both in quality & range was the food & beverages at the Club floor, particularly when compared to the western chains mentioned previously. The breakfast was pretty basic,and often not particularly well cooked, and the drinks offered during the cocktail period were mostly of a quite low quality, particularly the wine. (Mr Manager - a trip to the Ritz Carlton in Singapore may give an appropriate benchmark !).Notwithstanding the few negatives, we enjoyed our time at the Palace Hotel and think that on the whole it is a very good hotel indeed - there are just some parts that could do with improving to make it great. The owners and management has done well in creating a beautiful hotel and recruiting some very nice people - there are just certain aspects that are not really world class and need some improvement.We very much look forward to our return.","Oxford, United Kingdom","Keith M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",82,4.0

We stayed a total of two times over the course of two weeks for about 7 days total. On both visits we booked the standard room with club lounge access. I'll start by saying that the club lounge provided excellent value and service for what I felt was a very reasonable premium. Access includes a lovely breakfast, afternoon tea service and evening cocktails with heavy canapes. The food services were just lovely and the evening cocktail service was a perfect way to end the day and start the evening. Additionally, the lounge staff (led by the incomparable Ms. Matsunaga) was exceptional in helping to book train and restaurant reservations and in general ensuring that our stay was comfortable. The rooms themselves are truly a study in contemporary design yet able to retain that certain Japanese character which makes them so special. The beds had the most amazing linens and pillows dressing them. You would have thought you were in Italy but I checked and in fact the bed linens are made in Japan. So soft and smooth and cool! The bathrooms were a highlight with the best shower pressure I've experienced, great design, Toto washlets (of course) and really nice bath products from France or England depending on your type of room.The entertainment and electronic controls in the room were second to none. Numerous English channels as well as the option to connect your own device or listen to internet radio through the system. The electronically controlled curtains worked beautifully and were able to completely blacken the room (important when jet lagging!).Probably my favorite part of the room was the tea service provided and refreshed daily. The iron pots are made in an area of Japan that is well known for this and the teas themselves were awesome. There was no better start to a day than to brew a cup of strong green tea and sit on the balcony overlooking the palace (and Mt. Fuji on a clear day). Of course there was also coffee provided if green tea isn't your thing.Housekeeping was done at least twice per day and had to be the most thorough I've seen in my years of travel. Not one thing was overlooked or not replenished.The gym and swimming pool area were both well kitted out and very nice for a hotel gym and pool.Food in the Grand Dining room and in room dining were excellent quality and a good value for the yen. In particular the food in the Grand Dining Room was absolutely excellent for both breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. The menu is of more of a Western nature but the quality was excellent.Bell services were on time and perfect. Front desk was very helpful. Wifi was fast and free (about 15 mgbs up and about the same down). On a nice day it's about a 10 minute walk to Tokyo Station but there's also the Otemachi metro station in the basement which connects to 5 subway lines making it extremely convenient to get around. The basement of the building contains a 7-11 (important for Americans as this was the only ATM that worked for me) but also included a number of well priced boutiques for buying clothing, textiles and other items along with a wonderful deli style sweet shop with awesome fresh breads, pastries and savory bites.In summary, absolutely every person we encountered (really the standard in all of Japan) was helpful, pleasant and was just nice. Based on location and quality of the facility as well as the superior service this is the place to stay in Tokyo.","Miami, Florida","Miamiboys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",77,5.0

I asked the concierge if there was some place I could buy a plastic bag for my liquids and gels, but she was unable to find one close.

There is much to like at this recent rebuild of a Tokyo classic. The rooms are relatively spacious by Japanese standards with decent ceiling height, well equipped and good bathrooms. It is worth paying extra for the rooms with balconies that look out towards Hibiya rather than the standard rooms which have strangely angled windows designed to prevent you from seeing too much of the Imperial Palace. The location is good if you have business in the area or you need access to Tokyo Station but the district is somewhat lifeless in the evenings and at weekends.Although in many respects the hotel has most of the attributes of an international 5 star, I was disappointed by the service. Two of us arrived early but after a twelve hour flight from London I was hoping that they would show flexibility on giving us our room. We were told that we could have our room at noon and the check-in staff then kept to that schedule. When we asked if a room was available before that time they said the ""inspection"" was not complete. Restaurant recommendations by the concierge desk were disappointing. I was particularly annoyed by the attitude of the maître d' of the main all day dining restaurant, Grand Kitchen. I was trying to explain to the lady at the front that I wanted a table outside for lunch rather than join the waiting list for tables inside for coffee and cakes when he came over in an aggressive fashion and told me basically to wait my turn. When I explained what I was actually asking for and that there were at least four empty tables outside he did apologise but why had he behaved in this fashion in the first place. The next day he showed complete disrespect because I had invited to drinks two Philippinas who had worked for my family many years before.I always think the acid test of any review is would one stay again and in this case I believe the answer is probably no.","London, United Kingdom","PJW22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",131,3.0

There are also a lot of shopping malls nearby manourouchi. 20 mins walk to Ginza. There is an underground link below the hotel to go to other nearby malls, and some shops. Do try their patisserie shop at the lower ground floor. We tried their seasonal Sakura patisserie and it was a delight. The main reason why we kept coming back here is the Evian Spa! Prior to the treatment, you can use the sauna and hot spa. You can drink as much evian water as you want while at the spa. Good detox. The swimming pool is also lovely for lap swimming.The only ate food from the room service and the lounge area. Both were good.I would highly recommend this place when visiting tokyo.

The location is great--only 10 minutes to walk to Tokyo Station and just a few minutes away from the Marunouchi shopping and business district. Rooms are very large by Japanese standards. My room was very clean, comfortable, and had top notch amenities. I also was lucky enough to get an upgraded room with a view of the Imperial Palace grounds. There is a small shopping area in the basement of the hotel and a walkway that connects you to the subway. There are several restaurants in this area (udon, pizza, Irish pub, Tully's Coffee, etc.) and a 7-11 convenience store, which is open until 11pm each night. They also have a handful of gift shops that sell high quality Japanese merchandise. If you decide to purchase any gifts here, be sure to let them know that you are a guest of the hotel and they may offer a discount. . In addition to the subterranean dining options, there are several higher end restaurants on the 6th floor of the hotel. We ate at Go (teppanyaki) and it was fantastic. The only negative experience I had there was shortly after I checked out. I had a little time to kill before I needed to leave for the airport and decided to grab a quick lunch. I picked up a sandwich at one of the underground restaurants and was in the back of the hotel lobby on a bench by myself. It was extremely hot outside, so I decided to eat my sandwich on the lobby bench. Within a few minutes, a female hotel employee approached me and told me that I was not permitted to eat my sandwich there. She said that she knew that I was a guest of the hotel and was wondering why I was not eating in my room. I explained to her that I had just checked out and was leaving for the airport soon. She very rudely told me that I needed to take my sandwich elsewhere. I certainly did, but I was really upset at how rude she was, especially in light of the high level of service that I otherwise had received at this hotel. I felt like she should have been a little more tolerant of my sandwich eating or at least more polite with her request in light of the fact that my company had spent more than $10K at their hotel that week. Oh well.

Examples - the hollandaise sauce at breakfast is extra (although you pay $37 for a buffet breakfast), spa access is extra (unless pre-negotiated as part of the room rate), roll away beds are $100+ (we had 3 rooms and needed one rollaway but did without as it was a ridiculous price). Service is also not up to snuff for a hotel at this price point. The night we arrived they told us they could not commit to room service as they were very busy.

The amenities were luxurious and supplied plentifully. The air conditioning was quiet and very efficient. A freshly laundered sleep gown for night time was just one of the thoughtful touches this hotel supplied. Beds were very comfortable, so after a busy day out, we always felt at peace and rested inside the hotel.For our second stay we had two Deluxe Balcony rooms - these were also very comfortable, however my preference would be for the Grand Deluxe room because of the added space, and unique bathroom.Breakfast was also a highlight - the buffet was a wonderful combination of English/ American breakfast favourites, however there were some Japanese touches - Seaweed salad, a dark green freshly squeezed juice with spinach, omelettes made to order, and good espresso coffee etc etc. The breakfast set us up well for the day.The service (and I speak for all of Japan) here is superb, the concierge desk was always polite, and helpful - and went out of their way to help. Some restaurant recommendations may be on the pricey end, so check prior to going if that is a factor. Cleaning staff were discrete, and punctual - to be asked what time we would like turn down service, and for that to be adhered to for our entire stay was quite exceptional for a busy hotel. Check in and check out were swift - and the many porter staff, always there to greet you, or to help with transport.Another bonus for the hotel, is that it is situated on top of a subway station (not that you'd know it), and we travelled by subway most places, as you avoided traffic that way.

Whilst they replied that they will try to keep the room ready early (but said that it was already overfull), i had made up my mind to drop my luggage and come back at 3, but on arriving at the hotel, i was pleasantly surprised that the room was indeed ready for check in! 5 Stars to the reservations team to accept my request (and it was a complimentary early check-in)The room was breathtaking with amazing views of the Imperial Palace Gardens! The bed was super comfortable and the room was super spacious! Only one grouse that the storage space for luggage was limited (but my bad as I was in Tokyo for 10 days with family, so was overloaded to the gills!).The buffet breakfast at the GRAND KITCHEN was F.A.N.T.A.S.T.I.C, No words can describe the awesome spread laid out every single day!One word for the in-room dining agents! My wife wanted to make Indian style porridge for my baby, and requested them to cook it our style (and proper instructions were given), they did it with a SMILE and made it to perfection! Further, at any point in the day, they were obliged to heat up baby milk for us as well. It saved us so much hassle!Location wise, this hotel is situated in a fantastic location (walk able distance via underground Link with the Otemachi Station (almost all lines converge at the Otemachi) just a stones throw away from Tokyo Central Station. I would definitely recommend one and all to stay in this fantastic hotel!See you then!","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Bharatravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</strong>",39,5.0

I was in that plane. From Narita I directly went to Palace Hotel. My great experience in staying in this hotel on January 5-8th, 2014 is the main reason I came back to this hotel. The checked in process was so efficient. I arrived at the hotel check in counter around 11.45 am. Once I pronounced my family name, the reception immediately said welcome back Mr. Kadiman. Your room is ready and she handed to me the access card to the room. Before leaving my Jakarta office, my private assistance said that I can only check in around 2pm. The room was nice. It is located on 9th floor, it has a balcony with two chairs and a coffee table and from the balcony I enjoyed the beautiful view of neat gardens, ponds, pedestrians, birds and ducks of the Imperial (The Emperor) Palace. In fact, the name of the hotel I believe is determined by its location that is being a ""neighbour"" of The Palace. The wi-fi signal in the room and coffee shop is strong. Personally, I was feeling like working in the office. As well as a coffee shop and a western restaurant called The Grand Kitchen, in 6th floor there are Japanese and French Restaurants with many private rooms. Its very convenience venue for family and business dining. I invited my ex Indonesians students, Japanese apprentices and business partners to have lunch and dinner in the Grand Kitchens and Japanese Resto. The variety and quality of the food and beverages are excellent. The service is very effective and yet friendly. I wanted to jog and enjoy the pedestrians around the Palace unfortunately Tokyo was mostly raining during my stay. So, I enjoyed the fitness center in the Evian SPA located in 5th floor. I forgot to bring with me my sport shoes but it did not stop me from doing some physical exercises, sport shoes are availalble for rent. The concierges are very helpful. All information and helps I asked for were delivered satisfactorily.The check out process was also very efficient. It was completed within minutes. It is really a nice hotel: great scenery of the Palace, nice outdoor, neat and clean and a very effective and yet friendly services.","Jakarta, Indonesia","Kusmayanto K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jakarta, Indonesia</strong>",23,5.0

But of course, it was full so we decided to stay at the Palace Hotel since they said they underwent a new renovation. Everything I would have to say was perfect. From the arrival, which I did not even touch my luggage or a door knob once, to my departure; everything was handled professionally and cordially.Some highlights1.) My mother forgot her scarf on the plane so we talked with the concierge and he said ""no problem."" The next day, it was neatly folded on top of my mother's bed when she got back to her room. Service like no other I would say.2.) When we asked them to store the luggage, I accidentally forgot my hat in one of the luggages. Before I was able to tell them which luggage it was, BAM all 4 luggages was in front of me. My mouth was opened wide at all this attention to service.3.) When you leave the hotel in a car/taxi, they have attendants standing all along the driveway, as you drive pass, each one bows (like you are someone important or something) though it may not seem much, it shows how much respect they show for you.The roomThe rooms have automated almost everything. From the blinds, to the curtains, to the blinds in the bathroom. The rooms have an excellent view of the imperial palace too since the other side of the hotel, facing away from the palace, is usually used as an office building so all the guests should have palace view rooms. The hotelThe hotel itself is very grand, with high ceiling entrances and a breakfast buffet every morning and it should be included in the price. They ""say"" that the Otemachi station is located right beneath the hotel and they would be right but… the place where you actually get on the train is like a mile away, but they did dig a tunnel from the hotel all the way to the ""real"" station and called it the Otemachi station. I love Japanese sweets so good thing there was a 7 eleven downstairs in the basement, cause I stocked up on my sweets for months to come!! Too bad it closes at like 10:00pm though… not like the 24 hour 7 elevens.OverallThis hotel is usually for business men, as I see them roaming around the lobby in great numbers. The service is what really astonished me here, and I would come back just for the service itself! The rooms are also great and no complaints about the room. But the service is what outshines everything, even the Lamborghini that's parked outside.","Walnut, California","kainp2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walnut, California</strong>",9,5.0

The hotel is also located about 10 to 15 mins walk to the Tokyo station, which is one of the major subway / train station in Tokyo. If you need to go to the International Forum, it's about 15 mins walk from the hotel.The area around the hotel is nice, quiet and safe. My room overlooked the Imperial Palace Park with a nice green view (please see photo). You can also find nice restaurants nearby while walking toward the Tokyo station. We also tried a few of the local food stalls near Tokyo station (under the bridge). The rooms are surprisingly spacious give the hotel is located in the heart of Tokyo. The bed was comfortable. Most of the things are automated including the curtain and were controlled by a central panel next to the bed. Free WiFi was available in the room.Staff were generally helpful and polite. Breakfast was good with a reasonable selection of choices. Personally I liked the fried beacon which was crispy and tasty. I also suggest to try their ""exotic"" greenish juice (which I forgot the name). Sweet and slightly sour, help my appetite at the start of the day.The hotel rate was slightly pricey, maybe we stayed there over a conference period.All in all, Palace Hotel Tokyo is a nice and comfortable hotel if you don't mind the price.

In fact, it gets our highest recommendation. As you may have noticed, though, there is nothing thrifty about the Palace Hotel. Our dinner at one of the hotel restaurants has the dubious honor of being the most expensive meal I've ever purchased. Although this hotel is close to the train station and subway, don't think that you won't be needing to walk much- often the train platform is quite a long way away from the station (sometimes by a half mile or so).

It's five star facilities, many good restaurants and central location to the subway, Ginza and Roppongi hills works well in it favor.We arrived as a delegation at this hotel, and were greeted by the hotel manager. Check in was pre-arranged, and was thus fairly quick. Most of us checked in later in the day, but some, who had requested for early check in, received their rooms early to freshen up.The hotel lobby is grand, full of marble, and carpet and soft leather sofas. Lifts are card controlled, adding to the security for hotel guests. Cards will only take you to your floor. Rooms are very spacious and generous. My room had a king sized bed in the middle, with all the blinds, curtains and lighting control in modern control console on the bedside table. A sofa takes precedence next to the balcony window, and a round dining table sits beside it. A nice swivel chair is on the opposite side of the table. This would be a perfect place for in-room dining, if one should opt for that. There is a long table ledge stretching from the window to the red drinks cupboard. A large flat screen TV is hung on the wall. Lots of local TV channels as well as cable TV and news. The red drink cabinet houses all manner of small bottled alcoholic beverages, snacks and the usual assortment of fizzy drinks and beer. Near the door of the room is a large cupboard with an in built ledge for your roll-on luggage. However, if you are using a large check-in luggage, you'll have to find another place to store that.Carpet in the room is soft and new. The bed is semi-hard, and the sheets are relatively soft and nice. The turn down service leaves a bucket of ice in the room. The bathroom is open concept with two entry ways. There's inverted L-shaped toilet ""corridor"" with a large bath tub on one side, and the large single sink on the other. Lots of toiletries, including bath salt bottles, hair brushes, cotton buds and facial squares are available. On the shorter part of the L shaped corridor are the toilet, and the rain shower.The balcony is also accessible via a large sliding door. Outside, I enjoyed the fresh air and the view of canals running perpendicular to the hotel. The Imperial Palace is further to the right of my room.The room was very comfortable and more than adequate for the fussiest customer. Downstairs in the basement, I found more shops and food outlets. I enjoyed dinner in an Izakaya-themed soba restaurant. Very noisy with salary-men having a drink and dinner before heading home.In the morning or evenings, one can also head out for a run along the road that circles the Imperial palace.

We stayed for 5 nights and although the rooms were great, we felt the service from the reception desk lacklustre. It was manned by an off mix of individuals, at times a little nervous and other times cold and stern. Also, the lounge chairs had so many stains on them and i was a little surprised that a hotel that did so many other things right did not see to them and expected guests to take cocktails and dine in these conditions. On the other hand,the bellhops were probably the most welcoming than any other hotel we've been to and we travel plenty. They were very well informed and much more of a delight to interact with.

I went to Tokyo again a few weeks ago. For this second trip, I made reservations at the Park Hyatt figuring that I should check out the competition. However, as the trip approached, I realized I really wanted to go back to the Palace Hotel based on my prior experience, so I decided to go for the Palace Hotel again. I'm glad I did as I had another great experience at the Palace Hotel. Location is great being right next to Tokyo station, walking distance to Ginza and sitting on top of the Otemachi subway station that provides access to four subway lines that gets me to everywhere I need to go. It is also the only hotel literally right on the Imperial Palace grounds. It was just an amazing experience to have breakfast every morning on the hotel restaurant terrace overlooking the Imperial Palace moat where one can enjoy the imperial palace grounds with the occasional fish, ducks and even swans leisurely swimming by in the moat. It is hard to believe that the hotel is literally at the center of a 30+ million metropolitan area. As for service, I can not imagine better service, especially the service provided by the ladies at the club level lounge, including Ms. Suzuki (I hope you enjoy Manhattan this summer with our restaurant recommendations). When checking in at the club level, I was first greeted with a warm ""Welcome Back"", and then I was handed a bag with a bottle of contact lens solution and a nice cloths hanger that I left behind in my room six months ago. They kept my things for six months without me even asking. I was flabbergasted and totally sold on the hotel at thatcpoint as I have not had any similar experience anywhere else. It didn't hurt that I was upgraded both times, but I think I would have enjoyed my stays even without the upgrades as most rooms have good sized balcony overlooking the Imperial Palace grounds framed by Tokyo skyline. Design of rooms and common area are top notch as they were modern but also very thoroughly uniquely Japanese at the same time with no details overlooked as far as I can tell. The result is that the hotel has substantially more personality than other five star chain hotels, which is something that few modern hotels can pull off. It's difficult to convey in words, but one gets the feeling that this is a special place.

The club lounge was a wonderful place for both happy hour and breakfast. Happy hour included wonderful drinks and excellent draft beer, with appetizers and salad that would easily have substituted for dinner.

I can't say enough wonderful things about the hotel and the staff. The hospitality is unparalleled. Everyone from the valet to the receptionist to the restaurant staff was genuinely warm, courteous and wonderfully helpful. My double room was exquisite - luxuriously comfortable and spacious. The attention to detail was incredible. The bathroom was stunning and spacious (by American standards) with a jacuzzi-size bathtub, bidet (with warmed toilet seat), a small flat tv built into the bathroom mirror, high-end toiletry products, and baby-bottom soft bathrobes! I had a lovely view of the Imperial Palace grounds from my room, as the Imperial Palace was literally across the street from the hotel. Speaking of convenience, the hotel is only walking distance from the amazing Marunouchi restaurants and shops and Tokyo station, making all of Tokyo easily accessible.I can't recommend it strongly enough, other than to say I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.

It is centrally located in Tokyo and on top of the C13b exit of Otemachi station. Which itself is 1 stop away from Tokyo station. Pros: This hotel has all the normal top notch facilities of a luxury hotel. The rooms are large, modern, lovely, and well equipped. With cable and satellite TV in the bedrooms. And also in the bathroom. And free wifi everywhere. There is a bountiful and sumptuous morning brunch buffet which serves a yummy and wide selection of food which includes an egg station and very attentive, courteous and professional staff. However the over-whelming PLUS of this hotel is the staff. This place probably has the BEST CONCIERGE staff in the world. I was at the Palace Hotel for a business trip. And no matter what problems I had. The concierge staff sorted it out promptly, knowledgeably and with a smile. Need to confirm a reservation with an obscure local Japanese restaurant? No problem! Got a friend who is sick in hospital and needs cheering up? No problem! The concierge sent some wonderfully happy yellow and white cheerful flowers which brightened up an unhappy and sick woman in pain in a Tokyo hospital bed. Got a strange and delicate package that needs to be sent half-way around the world on a weekend? No problem! The staff magically knew the best and safest way to send delicate items by courier around the world. Even at the weekend when the post office was not open!But the most impressive thing I found, was the sheer dedication, competence and sense of pride and honour among the concierge staff. I asked for directions one Monday morning to go see the Currency Museum at the Bank of Japan. No problem! The concierge said it was a few stops away on the Hibiya line. Unfortunately he later found out that the museum shuts on Mondays. But he could not tell me as I had already set off to the museum. He tried his best to contact me, but alas, I was already on the train and could not be reached. When I returned from the ""now known to be closed"" Currency Museum, the concierge staff were incredible and had of their own volition and sense of honour and decency, bought me a lovely and tasty hotel Mango cream-cheese cake to say sorry for their tiny little oversight in missing the detail of the Currency Museum's opening hours. I was very impressed. There was no need for them to be so sorry, but I was deeply touched by their sense of duty and honour to their guests. Cons: None really. This hotel is not cheap. But then, what do you expect for a luxury hotel? In summary, the Palace Hotel has probably got the best hotel staff in the whole of Tokyo. I congratulate and salute the wonderful hotel staff of Assistant Chief Concierge Yuichi Hoshino and the exceptional team of Mai Hashitani, Kanako Honda and others at the hotel concierge and reception desks.To conclude, my stay in Tokyo was transformed by the wonderful staff at the Palace Hotel and I would happily stay at the Palace Hotel again. I cannot recommend or commend the exceptional staff of the Palace Hotel highly enough. The staff do great credit to their country and people by showing such superb hospitality and service to visiting travellers from afar. A job well done!

When compared to good hotels in other cities in the East Asian region, this is a bliss. The hot and cold water mixers in the shower works perfectly.The system pays real attention to the details.

The food and the service are among the top quality service like a 5-star hotel. Indonesian and Japanese food are available on the menu. The selection of musics and movies are plenty. Arrived in Narita Airport. We purposely selected the limousine bus service from the airport to The Palace Hotel, Tokyo. In our previous trips we tried train and taxis. The bus gave us a great travelling experience in the middle of Japan winter. We arrived and warmly welcomed by the doormen of Palace Hotel, Tokyo. The checked in process was so efficient. The room was on the 10th floor. We can enjoy the scenery of surrounding. We were amazed by the tidiness and the cleanliness. Perhaps, the top one from these two measurement. Choices of food are so wide from the coffee shop, lounge and some up scaled restaurants. We can also easily walk to the trains subway station. Plenty of selections of traditional Japanese cuisines around the stations. Bookshops and giftshops are also available. I and my wife stayed 4 days and 3 nights in Palace Hotel, Tokyo. A great experience. In short, Palace Hotel is so suitable both for business and holiday. The only not so positive point is that one shall be ready to dig his/her pocket deeper.

I stayed frequently in the old Palace but this was my first visit to the new version and how impressed I was.The new Palace Hotel has gone very much upmarket, making it perhaps the best hotel in Tokyo, in my opinion. The treatment of guests from arrival at the front door to delivery to room is impeccable and laced with traditional Japanese good manners – what a pleasure after what one gets in Europe and the US in similar establishments.The room (mine was on the 11th floor with a side view of the Imperial Palace) was absolutely peerless, roomy and spotless. All that you could ask for is provided and I cannot see what anybody would need to pay extra for a Club Floor room (where I normally stay) other than, perhaps, the use of the 14th floor Club Room. It seems to me that the hotel offers so much that the Club Lounge is rendered pointless. Really – the room is probably one of the best I have ever stayed in and is at least as good as the Tokyo Shangri La, which is also of very high quality and which I reviewed previously. The problem with the Shangri La is that it does not have the Palace view and facilities.So many restaurants are available that they are too many to mention – the food is excellent and beautifully presented in those we did eat at. A word of warning – with the Yen at its current value, the hotel food outlets are very expensive – I suggest that you pay a visit to the franchised food outlets in the Basement, including an excellent Irish Pub, which offer much better value.I did not use the Spa with its exceptional pool but my colleague who did tells me it is excellent.Internet is free for unlimited kit and lightning fast – what a pleasure!

As such, I expect nothing but perfection, esp at the prices you can pay in this city for a decent room. Read a few reviews about this hotel and really have no complaints. Rooms were great, view uncompromising and the lighting system not at all difficult to master! Not quite sure what others were having difficulty with! The only complaint I had was breakfast - but the one thing I never have high expectations for in Japan is a western breakfast. They just cannot do it right. When in Rome! Hubby had a superb Japanese breakfast, but they couldn't even toast my toast today. I would recommend that u take the buffet, despite the price tag, as u can go and get what u want and not be baffled by what is given to you. The descriptions in the menu are very misleading for the a la carte items, so if u want a bowl of cereal, for example, just ask if u can choose it directly from the buffet. The 10grain cereal is actually puffed wheat (yes, as in the kids fave) and not at all what u would expect. Other than that, very very nice hotel.

The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds, well-laid-out and well-appointed bathrooms, nice views of the palace grounds if you get a room facing that direction, and great sound insulation. The service is generally as good as you'd expect for a hotel at this price level. It's the sort of place that tempts you to lounge around in your comfortable room all day instead of going out into the city.But it gets knocked down from 5 stars for a few reasons. The breakfast is pretty lackluster for a hotel of this class, not much selection and nothing especially delicious. Breakfast was also the one time we experienced poor service during our stay; the staff asked if we wanted coffee and we said yes, but after ten minutes no coffee had arrived and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for it again. Nitpicky but at these prices you get to nitpick.The location is convenient if you're visiting the Imperial Palace or you have meetings in the surrounding office buildings. But for general sightseeing, it's a bit of a hike to several of the subway lines that in theory are right nearby, and I found myself thinking it would have been better to choose a hotel a couple blocks closer to the train station just for better subway access. If you take taxis everywhere it won't matter as much, but the subway is usually much faster than getting caught in Tokyo traffic.There are restaurants and shops in the arcade under the hotel. We ate at two of them and weren't impressed; the same quality food is available at much lower prices within easy walking distance, as is much better food at similar prices, e.g., at the ""Iyo!"" shopping arcade a couple blocks away. Those restaurants aren't part of the hotel per se, but given their location they factor into my impression of the place.The #1 thing that irritated us on an ongoing basis, though, was the lighting controls in the room. The overhead lights in the dressing area are on a dimmer, and we wanted to leave those lights dimly lit and turn off all the rest of the room lights at night. This turned out to be a nontrivial undertaking that required a fair amount of trial and error -- the bedside lighting controls, for example, will turn the floor lamp on, but won't turn it off again, so you have to flip the physical switch on the lamp if you want to turn it off while any other lights are on. Again, this is something I wouldn't bother complaining about in a budget hotel, but for the amount of money they charge, I expect them to have thought through common scenarios like wanting a non-pitch-black room at night.That's a bunch of complaints but really none of them were deal-breakers and we enjoyed our stay a lot. This hotel isn't perfect but it's pretty darned good, even at the price.","Sunnyvale, California","SteveAtLarge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",16,4.0

They had a bellboy take our luggage up to our room and gave us a tour. We were on the 18th floor facing the Imperial Palace. It was such a nice view. Our room was very clean. It looks like it just went through a remodel. The rain shower head was a great. The bidet was a nice touch. The location of the hotel is on the Otemachi Station. You can get to any part of Tokyo easily. We used the concierge every day to plan our day or schedule a reservation at a restaurant. The only negative is the breakfast buffet.

The hotel is located in one of the most prestigious Tokyo areas, Chiyoda, right opposite the Imperial Palace and close to the gate to the Palace's East Gardens. It is a mere 10 minute walk or a 5 minute ($7 cab ride) from Tokyo Station where the Narita Express from the airport arrives. The service in the majority of hotels in Japan is first class and the Palace was no exception - caring, courteous and very helpful. Our room was a good size, beautifully furnished, fabulous bed, nice bathroom with separate shower and exquisite toiletries, with towels that put the fluff in fluffy. Tokyo is a very easy city to get around and the Otemachi subway station, just minutes away, can be reached without going outside the building! The tourist open top bus service that runs 3 routes around the city is just a 5-10 minute walk away close to the station so for us tourists the Palace Hotel was extremely conveniently located. There are plenty of good shops in the Maranouchi area close-by and a Dean and Deluca if you are missing your coffee. We only ate in the hotel restaurant one evening and that was the more casual ground floor eaterie. We had some delicious tapas and 4 glasses of very nice red for a total of $75 so definitely weren't blown out of the water by the expense.

We chose the Palace after looking at the top 20 hotels in Tokyo, then refining them by the standard of rooms, design and levels of service. We wanted to avoid staying at a Hyatt, Mandarin or Four Seasons, so the Palace Hotel was a great option. It's also brand new and very modern. Being a Japanese owned hotel, it's standard is of the absolute highest level. Much like the Halekulani in Waikiki is of a superior level to the other multinational chain luxury hotels, we found the same at the Palace compared to the other bigger multinational hotels.The hotel is close to the JR station (Y1,000 taxi ride) or 5 - 10 minute walk if you have carry-on luggage. If you're arriving from the Narita airport JR train, follow the yellow Yaesu Central Exit signs for the taxi rank to get to the hotel. Upon arriving at The Palace after a 14 hour + flight from Melbourne, Australia, we were weary yet excited to explore Tokyo. We requested an early check-in but knew our chances were slim arriving at the hotel at 10am on a busy Saturday morning. To our delight, the check in staff apologised for the 1/2 hour wait - our room would be ready at 10.30am! The best apology I've ever had from check-in staff. This was the beginning of a faultless smorgasbord of world class, friendly, attentive service from the moment we arrived until well after we left (more on that later).We booked a Grand Deluxe Room which all come with a very large balcony, and the room is absolutely huge. There is a walk-in entrance, large walk-in dressing room (lots of hanging space, drawers, etc), very large area around the bed and then a day bed, armchair and table opposite the chicest mini-bar you'll ever lay your eyes on. The bathroom is absolutely divine, floor to ceiling marble (in muted tones), with clever mirrored walls throughout to make the bathroom appear huge and bright. The obligatory spaceship grade toilet is hidden behind a frosted door allowing the rest room to again be bright and welcoming. The bath and shower area is breathtaking, with the bath having a corner window to look out over the Tokyo skyline and palace gardens below. The Toto taps and shower heads are both excellent (sadly not available back home - I've already checked!), and tech heads will love the TV seamlessly built into the mirror (the funnest morning shave I've ever had). If you have a tendency to pilfer the amenities, you're in for a treat, provided you have a large luggage allowance for the flight home. The bath products are French Anne Semonin products used in the spa and I found them to be both luxurious and gentle on my sensitive skin. There were 8 individual bath products left in the shower and bathroom, and these were replaced twice daily where needed. There was also a long list of other amenities, wooden hair brush, razors, toothbrushes, hair bands and all the other usual items. The towels deserve their own award, they are Imabari towels made in Japan and the softest you'll find in any hotel in the world (albeit typically small in Japanese fashion). If you fall in love with them (guilty as charged) they are sold in the friendly towel shop in the world in the underground Palace shopping complex.The television in the bedroom is huge, the bed is incredibly comfortable and the block out curtains (all electric) and blinds mean the room is pitch black at night. All the room furniture is of the highest standard and beautifully designed. The carpets feature a cherry blossom pattern which lifts the slightly masculine feel of the room. This is by far the best quality furnished room I have stayed in globally, and the design is classic yet modern chic. Everything is brand new from the floor up - a distinct advantage over the Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula and Imperial Hotels.The room service was of a high standard, and although I'm not sure it was intentional (probably was knowing this hotel), we had the same incredibly friendly staff member each time we ordered a meal. The other meals we had were also of a high standard in the hotel restaurants. We had dinner at the Grand Kitchen (my least favourite meal purely because I wasn't crazy about the table design and chairs and it was on the cold side seated right next to the windows - the food however was excellent) and coffees in the main lobby.Another highlight was Privé, the restaurant bar on level 6. The room is intimate and beautifully designed with a jaw dropping view of Tokyo and the gardens below. The service here was absolutely faultless, the female front of house who seated us each time was so lovely and elegant, we couldn't wait to go back each time, and we did go back, 3 times. At lunch they offer a 3 course meal of soup, main and dessert for only Y3,000 excluding drinks. At that rate, and with a great meal and dessert included (my favourite from my whole trip - a cherry blossom themed light vanilla dessert with raspberry) we splurged and ordered Cristal (2008) by the glass at Y3,300 (the Louis Roederer NV is a relative bargain at Y2,000 a glass), which compared to what that would cost in Australia, was an absolute steal. The bar was quiet most of the time, however for dinner on the Tuesday night, as we were leaving it was filling up with salary men who were ordering martinis by the table - so might have been fun to stick around. Indeed we found the lounge and lobby very busy on weekends but virtually empty on weekdays, whilst the on-site restaurants downstairs and upstairs were very busy on weeknights and quiet on weekends.In terms of other services, we utilised the laundry service with excellent results. I would recommend calling housekeeping to have an iron in your room for your stay if you want to save on the cost of having your clothes pressed. There is also a very well stocked (and super friendly) 7-11 downstairs (with a foreign ATM) which sells juice and soft drinks for well below the cost a few floors above. If you can bring yourself to drink Y1,200 bottles of wine, you'll find that too!When it came to check out, we were travelling to Tokyo for two days and couldn't bare to take all our luggage with us. The bell desk didn't blink an eye at our request to hold onto 8 bags for a further 48 hours. And that's the way it was at the Palace Hotel. No matter what the request, there was always a 'yes'. Nothing was too much trouble. There are too many small examples to mention of this however I would say that all the staff we met took absolute pride in the service they provide. There were some previous reviews that (fairly) described the service as overwhelming or over-the-top, but once you realise the staff are passionate about service, and are the best at what they do, you can really get used to it without the guilt. A returned bow and thank you in Japanese will always be appreciated by the staff also.In terms of location, you need to decide what's important to you where you stay. We were willing to trade being in the thick of it (Shinjuku / Shibuya / Ginza) with the more relaxed, elegant atmosphere of the Imperial Palace views and corporate buildings near by. You will feel 'out of the action' at this hotel, but it's only a train stop away (2 minutes). We found this the absolute best compromise - walking and jumping on trains all around Tokyo each day till our feet were literally bleeding, and then coming back to the Palace Hotel, pouring a champagne and lying in the bath watching the Tokyo skyline from afar. We met friends staying in Shinjuku and frankly the sheer amount of people everywhere meant you were dodging people the moment you left their hotel. I would also recommend booking a tour of the Imperial Palace grounds with the imperial household agency, there are a limited amount and you need to book up to 2 months in advance. We also got PASMO universal train cards that you can use on any tokyo metropolitan train line (subways and JR lines) from Concierge.The train network is something else, as you can expect, and we mastered it in a day or two thanks to a couple of fantastic iPhone apps. The best thing to do is order a b-mobile data SIM before you arrive (they will post it to your hotel the day before) so you can use google maps on your iPhone, it will plot out which trains to catch and where to change stations.The downstairs shopping precinct was dead on weekends but busier on weekdays. The shops downstairs include the exquisite Imabari towel shop, a spectacular (but minimalist) pottery/crockery store with very reasonable prices along with the amazing sweets & deli shop and a number of all small gift stores.As we returned from Kyoto and then picked up our baggage and moved onto another Tokyo Hotel (Capitol Hotel Tokyu - great hotel but not even close to the Palace in any respect, although the Capitol is much more affordable), I could not forget the fantastic experience we enjoyed at the Palace Hotel. In fact, on our last day in Tokyo, five days after checking out of the Palace, we went back and had lunch Privé one last time before our flight home (complete with Cristal!), bought towels and crockery from the shops below and then sadly jumped on the subway headed to the airport - we just didn't want to leave! Finally on my way home, I recalled the Palace sell the unique essential oil scent that features in the hotel lobby spaces, and I had forgot to pick some up from the Concierge. I emailed the hotel the day I returned to Melbourne and asked if they would post some out to me (for the cost of the oil and postage of course) and sure enough I received the essential oil a few days later in the post.We will definitely be back to The Palace Hotel. Until then, we'll have to make do with the essential oil scent, the towels, the crockery...and a few cheeky amenities!","Melbourne, Australia","ABMJRC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",23,5.0

As befits a great 5-star hotel, the design, atmosphere, rooms, service, location and dining were all top-of-the line. The Palace was completely rebuilt and re-opened just in 2012, so everything still feels new and fresh. There is an element of classic yet ultra-modern design and art infused in every area of the hotel from the restaurants to the lobby and rooms. The architect clearly took advantage of the natural setting of the Palace right beside the Imperial Palace grounds and moat. While Tokyo in general is a fairly tranquil city, the tall glass facade that overloos the palace moat in the lobby, the use of green and off-white hues and the separation of the more active restaurant areas from the check-in lends the Palace a remarkable air of luxurious tranquility right in the middle of the world's largest city. Service was always prompt, fluent in English and on hand whenever needed. I've stayed at other 5-star hotels in Japan and it has not always been this easy to communicate in English. What separates 5-star hotels from 4-stars tends to be the level of service and number of staff. In this regard, the palace never disappointed. I never had to wait in line for anything and there were always several staff members on hand who I could turn to for service.The room was of generous size and the beds were of top quality. Possibly the greatest asset of the rooms are the balconies with stunning views overlooking the imperial palace and Marunouchi skyline. Even the lower floor rooms will benefit from this view. It was a very welcome introduction to the city and great to wake up to every morning. As the hotel is new, the technology in the room is all up to date. Of course, all the usual amenities are provided, but there are also a few extras too. For example, there is a built in flatscreen into the bathroom mirror which was quite nifty. Also, the bathroom is designed open plan so you can open it up to the main room. It includes a separate walk-in shower and large soaking bathtub. I was in Tokyo on business and the Palace hotel's location adjacent to the Marunouchi financial district was a huge benefit. We were able to walk to many of our meetings while also enjoying the scenery in the parks on the way back. This will suit travellers on leisure as well! While the hotel benefits from many restaurants, I mainly dined at the main all-day facility for breakfast. The Breakfast buffet was not huge in variety and quantity but more than made up for that in quality. As in many Japanese things, the focus was on providing a smaller selection of great quality items instead of more of everything. The roasted potatoes and sausages were some of the best I've had! In short, the Palace is what 5-star city hotels should all aim to live up to. Service, design, atmosphere, tranquility, luxury, large rooms with up to date technology... everything was flawless.",South Pole,"Tanagan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pole</strong>",109,5.0

Posh, pretty and prime, guests will be accorded 5-star treatment with true Japanese hospitality in a contemporary space. Positives:1. The rooms are huge, and by Tokyo standards that already has a lot going for it. 2. If i am not wrong, all rooms have balconies that open up to awesome views of either the Wadakura park and skyscrapers of Ginza, Minato and Ropponggi or the Imperial Palace. Lovely vistas night or day. 3. The room is decked out impeccably. Comfortable beds, a settee, lots of mood lighting. Very clean.4. My room had a open-concept bathroom, with doors and screens or could deploy for privacy. There was a standing shower and a bathtub. And my God the shower! There's a rain shower option that shoots wonderful jets of spray from the ceiling. Alternatively, the massage options on the shower head plus the super water pressure should be sufficiently pleasing. 5. There's a TV screen built into the bathroom mirror so that one can be entertained while lounging in the tub or brushing teeth. 6. The turn-down service crew comes around in the evening to refluff your pillows, lay out a set of pyjamas, and restock water and other disposables. They also leave bedtime candies and the breakfast menu. 7. Location - some would argue it's off the main fun areas of Tokyo. I figure it's a respite from the hubbub, noise and lights. Otemachi and Tokyo stations are pretty close by. It's great for business trips into Marounochi and Chiyoda areas. Tokyo has the convenient Airport Express to Narita. 8. The hotel can arrange a shared bus to Narita or Haneda airports. The bus picks up travellers from other hotels so it takes a whole but it's way cheaper than getting a taxi. Negatives1. The selection of TV programs is sort of boring. Not enough family/popular entertainment options. No HBO. (Well it is a business hotel really.)2. I couldn't figure out how to control the main corridor light from the door. It seemed I could only do so from beside the bed. 3. Inevitably, such an awesome stay at a fabulous hotel is pricey. Regular rates are something like US$380 a night at the least. Hotel breakfast is about US$40. We opted for muffins and coffee at the nearby Dean & Deluca.

Our 18th-floor room had plenty of natural light and overlooked the moat and garden area across the street. Lots of toiletries are provided, along with nightshirts and the usual robes and slippers. The mattress was very comfortable and the hand-held shower head was the best ever - I want one for our home!We paid for access to the club level, and it was well worth it, at least for the one night we stayed. The club room is nicely decorated with a view overlooking the Imperial Palace grounds as well as the park area south of the hotel. Service was excellent. We arrived in time for the afternoon tea option, so had a quick coffee and scones. Later we enjoyed the cocktails and canapes, which served as a light dinner. The lounge wasn't crowded, and it was pleasant relaxing over a glass of wine and looking at the city lights. Breakfast the next morning was more than sufficient, if not the huge buffet we'd had elsewhere. At checkout, they presented us with a souvenir photo they'd taken of us on the little terrace the afternoon before.As others have noted, the location is quiet but only about 3 blocks from the main train station. If you want nightlife, it's very easy to take a train to Shinjuku or subway to Roppongi. It was even convenient to walk to the station with our luggage (wheeled) to catch the express train to Narita when we left. Though the hotel is not cheap, we felt it warranted the price and would love to stay there again if we return to Tokyo. A few minor quibbles:1. Why are so many hotels going to using all-in-one duvets as bedding? I applaud the replacement of gross bedspreads with duvets which are laundered every stay, but they are too hot and heavy for me. Please also provide a separate top sheet.2. When we checked in, the clerk asked if the normal noon check-out time was all right for us. We responded that our train was at 2:30 and if we could stay until 1:30 or 2 it'd be greatly appreciated. She left to check, and came back with 12:30 as the latest they could allow. This was fine, as we hadn't counted on a late check-out, but I'd suggest not raising the possibility of an extension if it isn't available.","Chicago, Illinois","NSsummerset</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",30,5.0

This time the Imperial was full so I stayed at the recently opened Palace hotel. Which is better?1) Price. For a nine night stay the Imperial is quite a bit cheaper and in my view represents better value for money.2) Location. Overlooking water and the Imperial Palace yet within walking distance of Tokyo station I can't think of a better location for a Tokyo business hotel. Palace wins. (Having said that the Imperial is also in a superb location).3) Food. I don't dine at either hotel's fine dining restaurants but just have simple light meals in the evening at either hotel's ground floor cafeteria-style restaurants. The Imperial wins hands down. (I didn't think The Palace's food was anything special at all).4) Service. I have never stayed anywhere in the world with service as good as the Imperial's. The service at the Palace is excellent but not on a par with the Imperial's.5) Rooms. Refurbished rooms in the main tower of the Imperial are excellent as are the Palace's. Score draw.6) Sauna etc. Imperial club members receive free use of the Imperial's sauna and pool whereas you pay Y3,000 for a sauna and Y2,500 for a swim at the Palace. The Imperial's sauna and relaxation room has a wonderful clubby ambiance whereas the Palace's seems 'dead'.7) Telephone. Phoning home from the Palace is a rip-off while phoning home from the Imperial is reasonably priced.Next time I'll try to check into the Imperial before trying the Palace.....having said all of the above if you're with a colleague, and if you've got a healthy expense account, you could have a great time at the Palace.

The bathrooms are very luxurious, with great water pressure in showers. The staff is superbly attentive, as you would expect from a 5 star Japanese hotel. I have been a frequent guest at, and a huge fan of, the Four Seasons Marunouchi, but I tried this hotel on a recommendation from a friend. Despite my high regard for the Four Seasons, I find this hotel even better, primarily because of the wider selections of restaurants, the great breakfast (which can be included with room), and the more convenient walk to the office buildings.

Staffing levels and service standards are so high that, for us do-it-yourself Americans, walking through the lobby felt like running a gauntlet.

My trousers ripped at the airport and they were my only pair. I had a pretty important meeting the next day at 9am. I called the hotel and pretty calmly they arranged for a tailor to pick up the trousers when I arrived which was around 10:30pm. The trousers were then mended (the rip had been total and very embarassing) and dry cleaned for the morning at a cost of around double the price for dry cleaning - so pretty good value at the same time. This maybe says more about Tokyo than the hotel but i think there are some other 5* hotels in Tokyo that would not have been quite as acommodating. 2) the rooms are ecellent. I would say marginally smaller than the rooms of the Mandarin and in a similar style but feel more homely. Also they have balconies in addition and my one was large enough for a full outside table and soft chair. Everything in the rooms is electric as you expect in tokyo and the TV in the bathroom (built into the way at one end of the full length bath) is the largest I have seen in Tokyo. The room also had a big tv and a dvd player as standard. The selection of TV stations was also better than most Tokyo hotels including some movie channels such as wowwow and discovery so overall entertainment was great. Room service was delicious although the after 10pm menu was a little limited.  3) the view is right over the imperial palace grounds and because of the expanse you can see all the way to roppongi with Mori tower very evident as well as Tokyo tower. Of course somerooms dont look in that direction but pretty much all of them have some sort of view over the palace grounds. the location was also to die for - yes as someone said its not right in roppongi or ginza but compared to the shang or mandarin its just as good and its so close to tokyo station you can basically go anywhere. 4) the staff even by tokyo standards are insanely perfectionist.  5) the pool , the Evian spa (yes it sounds pretentious but its amazingly good ) and the chapel are all lovely as is the gym. The lobby is expansive and beautiful. 6) there are three high end restaurants - french, japanese, and chinese as well as an italian themed casual restaurant on the ground floor with a terrace overlooking the moat of the palace.I stayed in the old Palace Hotel often when it was still a 6 story building built in 1961 (indicentally there is a book detailing the history of the hotel for your perusal in each room which you can take home) and it was a good hotel if flawed.

A beautiful property and wonderful staff. Located across the street from the Imperial Palace with great views. The room was large and well appointed with a ""spa like"" bathroom complete with amazing shower and great water pressure! The only downside - and very minor- was breakfast buffet lacked variety of more ""western"" style fare. Overall - a true 5 star experience.","Copenhagen, Denmark","TravellerH55</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",13,5.0

Marunochi area is a bonus being great for shopping and eating. JR train station and the main Tokyo station isn't far away. Great renovation. Nice and modern feel but definitely not cold. Homey is the perfect description. Reasonably priced in my opinion. I love to eat, relax and read a book by the outdoor seating area overlooking the Palace. The lounge is perfect for sipping tea or drinking beer. I also enjoyed eating breakfast at their lobby outlet. Ate there for two straight days trying both the traditional Japanese breakfast and the usual continental buffet. Rooms are big and new. Great view i must say. Staff are very polite. I like this hotel better than the other five star hotels in the area.","Manila, Philippines","dorycook</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",109,5.0

Adjacent to the Imperial Palace grounds and East Garden, it is somewhat removed from the crowded action of Tokyo and more geared to business clientele rather than tourism. However, the Otemachi subway is a block away and the Tokyo station is an easy walk (or 710 yen for a taxi). A line of taxis is always waiting. The Marunouchi Building is a short walk offering dining and shopping, and the Ginza is just minutes away. Citibank is down the street for banking needs. The hotel interior is bright with a contemporary edge and designed very well with a large lobby- front desk, concierge, and bellman on one side and a spacious lounge and restaurant with terrace dining overlooking a moat on the other. The atmosphere is relaxed and not stuffy. The lobby restaurant and lounge menus offer a nice selection and the cocktails are very well made. A restaurant in the park is also open for lunch, but we did not eat there so i can not speak for the menu.An escalator from the lobby leads down to an small arcade with small specialized shops, a 7/11, a few Japanese restaurants, and a Irish pub which offers a relaxed small pub atmosphere with Quiness and English pub fare (although not smoke free). The hotel's formal restaurants I feel need improvement. They were rather pricey as expected but I was just not that impressed with my dinner. Other close dining options (of all prices) were a good alternative. The hotel breakfast, however, was very good either ala carte or buffet with a Western selection for a full English breakfast of sausage, bacon, grilled tomato, sauteed mushrooms, potatoes, and eggs made to order; stations for bread, danish and fresh toast; fresh juices, milk, and cereals; another for a charcuterie of cheese, meats, and pickles.The rooms have very comfortable beds, and a nice design with the standard large TV on the wall, a room bar, and large closets. The windows are large and designed to have good views with automatic room darkening drapes. The bathrooms are very large and luxurious with an open glass bath, separate shower, sink with a mirror TV, and separate toilet with heated bidet features. Blinds provide privacy for the bath. Perhaps the Palace's best feature, however, is the service provided by the staff. Room service is just minutes away. Everyone treats you like royalty, and a walk through the lobby will never go without someone asking at least once if you need anything. Doormen always take care to explain to the taxi driver exactly were you are going. The concierge is extremely knowledgable and helpful, came to say goodby with bottles of water as we checked out and accompanied us to our taxi. There is no question we would return.","Rumson, New Jersey","Tricia H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rumson, New Jersey</strong>",84,4.0

Very convenient location for business in Chiyoda and also not too far from good shopping in Ginza. However, not a very lively location at night or over the weekend. The views of the imperial palace are obviously great and make this a very unique place - my favorite spot was the terrace of the lobby restaurant - just so relaxing and great atmosphere any time of the day.Hard to find faults - if anything, pricing of some of the services seems a bit off; unless staying in a club level room, guests have to pay for both using the pool (JPY 2,000) and the spa (JPY 2,500), which seems unusual for a hotel of this class / pricing; also a simple coffee at JPY 900 and a continental breakfast at JPY 2,500 is quite steep. Selection at breakfast buffet (JPY 3,500) is good quality but limited.
