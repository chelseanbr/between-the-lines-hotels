The room is VERY small but all the essentials are there — including a wonderful soaking tub. The bed has very lovely down pillows, according to my husband. I'm allergic to down, but a staff member very kindly offered me a memory foam pillow as a replacement. I really loved that they include an electric tea kettle and mugs, and offer complimentary teas at the front desk!The staff overall was pleasant and helpful, and I really appreciated the complimentary lotions and face masks made available. The hotel itself is right by the Kinshicho JR station, which can be used to get to Narita airport with no transfers, and there are a number of great restaurants right in the vicinity.

We booked a room for 2 and it was small like a sardine can. Double bed is actually for 1, and is like a super single. Went to the counter to ask if we could pay for an upgrade, they said yes but charged us 7000yen a night. I told the guy that if that’s the case I’m better off booking another room because rates were low due to the coronavirus. He said “please go ahead and do”. “This is a business hotel and Tokyo rooms are small like this!”. Good lord, they are not even full and it doesn’t hurt to offer upgrade for a smaller sum.

My room, a Compact Single, costed an average of 55 dollars per night except on weekends where it increased slightly (nothing too ridiculous though).The hotel was just a 5 minute walk from JR/Tokyo Metro Kinshicho Station and featured a plethora of shops and restaurants to choose from (there's 3 shopping malls within a 10 minute walk + a 24H FamilyMart behind the hotel). The staff at reception were very kind and accommodating, and even though their English skills weren't that great they did the best they could. I had requested a Compact Single room in the upper floors of the hotel for a better view of the train tracks and they were able to fulfill this request (even though they had warned me the rooms might not be available during my stay). The room was small and my luggage didn't fit well, but this is to be expected by Tokyo standards so I didn't mind. One thing this hotel has that other Fresa Inns don't are free smartphones with unlimited data. While I had already rented a portable Wi-Fi router this could be ""handy"" for travelers on a budget. Speaking of the Wi-Fi - that worked perfectly fine during the whole trip (12th floor) and power plugs are plentiful (including one right next to your bed in a cubby hole). Bathroom was entirely plastic and had a bunch of amenities avaliable (the hair dryer was in one of the desk's drawers and more amenities could be found for free in reception). Minifridge worked even without the card inserted into the powerslot and kept decently cool. TV was entirely Japanese channels. The hotel also offers what they call ""eco-cleaning"" - they'll take out the trash and make the beds but nothing else, and you get a free water bottle for doing this.Breakfast was carried out in a dining area that (I believe) operated as a regular restaurant the rest of the day. Food was a mix between Japanese and Western meals, nothing too fancy taste-wise but not completely inedible either. Free coffee was available in reception.One thing I didn't quite like was how the whole laundry thing was handled. There were only two washing/drying machines on the second floor and they got filled up almost constantly the whole day. It should, nevertheless, be pointed out that the hotel does provide laundry service at a slightly higher price than the washing machines. Furthermore guests would leave their laundry in the machines and take their sweet time to pick them up (this isn't the hotel's fault). The vending machine in this room - the only one in the entire hotel - ran out of merch by the 4th day of my stay.Aside from that, however, my stay at the Kinshicho Fresa Inn was excellent. I would once again like to thank the staff for their courteous treatment during my entire stay (regardless of language barrier). Wouldn't doubt (and heck, probably will in the very near future) staying here again in the near future, not one bit!","Irun, Spain","Vasconium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irun, Spain</strong>",17,5.0

Cons - Extension hour is chargeable after 10am at ¥1,400 with no negotiation , staff need to be more attentive with guest check in , we were not allow to check in early (12pm +) even though we had a long night flight, as this is hotel policy so its fair enough. We were only informed that the room is ready when we approached the counter at 3pm and our luggage are already in the room, while we were resting in front of them all the time , they couldn’t even tell us that our room is ready early???

The staff were very friendly, genuine, and helpful.The coin laundry and vending machines were handy. For the price it would be nice if there were some more amenities, ex. a fitness room or sento.The location (near the station) was convenient and I liked that the neighbourhood was a bit quieter. Overall a good, basic, clean night's sleep – but next trip I would probably try a different hotel with larger rooms and more amenities.","Hong Kong, China","Ben M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",0,4.0

Sure hotel / hostel rooms are really small with tiny toilets as well . But this one had such a tiny space for a doubleOccupancy room . My husband and I barely could move with our luggage ( we only had 1) occupying partOf the entrance already. The bed had in fact only one side accessible as the other side is already pushed beside the wall . I suggest they convert this room into a singleOccupancy room that way they can put a single instead of a double bed inside the room amd therefore provide more space for the occupant to move . Buffet breakfast was the same all straight 3 days that we were there I hope something can be done to add varietyBig PLUS was the Filipina house keeping staff on the 5th floor . She cleaned our room really spic and span and had the most genuine and sweet smile for us . Other plusAlthough location is about 30 mins away from Shinjuku via train ride which is where all the action is , the train station was walking distance about 2 mins away . Restaurants , bakeshop , convenient stores , Life grocery and 2 other malls are just around the corner and all walkable .

The cheapest is subjective depending on how much you are willing to spend on accomodations.Location:The hotel is a 2 min walk from Kinshicho Station which is a station away from the Tokyo Skytree via Hanzomon Line 2 station away from Asakusa via Hanzomon Line, 3 station from Akihabara via Chou-Sobu Line. Shinjuku, Nakano and Shibuya is easily accessible with no line transfers required. The most convenient line in Kinshicho is the Rapid Sobu Line where it is connected to Narita International Airport which is cheaper than NEX and Skyline but the travel time is longer (est. 1.5 hour). At the basement of the station, there is a grocery store and a Yodobashi Camera from the Ground Floor up to the 3rd Floor. Please note that there are other facilities in the upper floor of the station.
