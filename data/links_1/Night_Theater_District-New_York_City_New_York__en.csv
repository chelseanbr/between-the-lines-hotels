So l asked them to change it twice since there was hair on the second robe too.And the carpet was spotty the bathroom faucets were lose.Bed linens were too old had scratch feeling flakes on them.There were too many holes in the closet.The room is too dark and it’s lack of lighting. I had trouble with adjusting the lights.There were facility fee which included gym outside the building but never instructed by anyone.When I check out I told the front desk about these issues but they only told me to email them.When I email them they refused to accept what happened and did not apologized.They keep saying that there were no evidence for that.So I will share the photo of evidence here.",,884crystall,0,2.0

You're right in the middle of all the action, and steps away from Times Square and all the theaters. I checked in a bit before 3pm (more like 2:30) and they did have a room available for me. It's a small boutique hotel with a sushi restaurant (Red Moon) right on the first floor. If you're walking by, and you blink, you may miss the entrance. Whoever is at the front desk could greatly vary from cold as ice, to friendly and welcoming. It just depends on who's working that shift. The decor is all black and white, so it's very bougie/chic with a nighttime vibe (hence the name). Yes, the elevators are a bit on the slow side, but if you get a room on the 2nd floor, the stairs on the left goes right to the floor. It seems like since this hotel opened, it's been run down by tourists. It'll always have business because of location, but my ironing board was missing, no bathrobe, and only 2 hangers in the closest (one of which was broken). BUT it's a good thing I'm a low maintenance person. All these people that left bad reviews are spoiled. It just took a quick phone call downstairs to get a robe and more towels, and they were more than accommodating to bring me whatever I needed. They honored the do not disturb sign on my door, but if housekeeping ran into me in the hallway, they'd ask if I needed anything. My answer was always ""no"". My room was perfect for a solo, but will be crowded for 2 people. There was no drawer space except for the 2 night stands on either side of the bed. The bed was like sleeping in a soft cloud, and the hotel was very quiet at night, since it seems to cater more to adults than families. The bougie black and white decor gave more of an urban feel, but the room stayed dark when all the curtains were closed.  I personally had a GREAT time staying here. It was close to everything, and it seemed like my own private getaway from the Times Square craziness. And it's great to have a staff that's respectful to my privacy. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!!","Los Angeles, California","AnneLuvabull</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",52,5.0

Our flight was delayed, so we called the hotel to let them know. My sister provided her name but the hotel desk person was very short with her and just said, ""we got it."" When we went to check in, we were put in a room on the 8th floor. When we got up to the room in the EXTREMELY slow elevator, the door looked like it had been broken into and didn't fully shut. The key cards we were provided didn't work, so we had to go back down with our luggage to the front desk. The front desk guy took us back up to the room, and the keys still didn't work. We were then moved to a room on the 7th floor with a door that also did not shut all the way. There are no amenities at this hotel. To make things even worse for our stay, the AC went out in the ENTIRE hotel our 2nd to last night. When we woke up Tuesday morning, our room was 76*.

While I was checking in, he noticed my Playbill for ""The Prom."" This opened the conversation to all the shows we've seen, our friends in the theatre, and New York sites. Of note, during the check-in process, guests walking in took time to stop by and just say ""Hi"" to him. He wished them happy birthday, conversed in Spanish, and never missed a single beat in our conversation. Check-in was not only seamless, it was enjoyable. The room on the other hand left a lot to be desired. To start, the only AC was a free-standing portable unit with plastic tube connected to the window. At some point prior to occupying the room, the hose had become detached. As a result, it was hot in the room and it never cooled down. Also, the smells from outside made their way into the room, which is unfortunate during the baked sewage heat of summer in Manhattan. In the bathroom, the shower curtain didn't fully reach the floor, which partially flooded the tile. This might explain why one tile was loose and rocked back and forth.

During check in, we learned we cannot use the refrigerator for our own use. Ok, that’s understandable. We check the refrigerator after check in to see the fridge does not even include any hotel snacks. What’s the point of having it in the room? Is that a part of the room decor or? Second, we tried taking photos in the lobby before dinner with a good quality camera, just to have the front desk say they don’t permit professional photography... really? We received a business card to the media team to set up a photo shoot. What a joke! Overall, the room is OK for a NYC hotel room- very tight. The sink however, is broken, and the elevator fits 3 people max. (Lol). Lastly, we requested new towels for the room just to receive one set (for two people) 30 min later...Can’t do this, can’t use that, what else can’t the guests do? I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",,Justine_jj721,1,1.0

But because we were there to sleep only as we were out all day/evening, it didn't affect us. We did know about this before booking so weren't shocked and hence it was fine.2) The room is small, but as per the reasons above, it was fine and I believe space is an issue in all Manhattan hotels.3) It was billed as having a safe which it didn't, but when we raised with reception, they sorted one out for us, but it isn't fixed in, it is portable so can be removed.4) There is no wardrobe/closet. There is a mini rail above the fridge to hang clothing on and we had to ask for more hangers. Not great, so we lived in/out of our suitcases for the week, but we did have an iron in the room so that helped. But we managed.All in all, it was a comfortable hotel, only 8 floors so not too vast and the reception team were helpful. The location of the hotel is its biggest advantage and it is opposite Planet Hollywood and at the end of the road is Times Square by the red Ticket Steps. Great for walking to a lot of the sights plus subway stations. I would stay there again and would recommend to others, but bearing in mind all the points I made above and then you won't be disappointed. If you do want more 'home comforts', then you may wish check out other hotels but then you will have to pay a higher price and may have to compromise on location. But all in all, it proved to be a great base for the type of trip we booked.","West Midlands, England","Annski1974</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Midlands, England</strong>",46,3.0

The rooms are nice, but small - which shouldn't be too surprising given that space is a luxury in the middle of Manhatten. Be warned: I'm 6'3 in height and I struggled to fit in our Queen-sized bed comfortably. The bed has a wooden end, which means you can't just stretch out and hang off the bed. Also worth noting is that you can hear everything on your floor. People coming back from a night out and making noise? You'll here it. Someone opening their door and closing it behind them? You'll hear it. However, other than that - the place is a gem.The look and feel of the place is supurb. It's not a coincidence that the place is called Night. The dark feel as you walk through the main lobby, or along the hallways is great; also creepy (as if in a thriller movie). The rooms are much the same in style as the rest of the hotel. The windows are shrouded with black curtains which do well to keep light out, and the bed is shadowed by an immense bedhead/art piece. The bathroom with its black tiles follow suit to the theme of Night.The location is outstanding. Right near Broadway and pretty much a breath away from Time Square; you are truly in a key spot to visit the rest of Manhatten from such a central location. We pretty much walked during our entire trip, except for when we used a hop-on/hop-off buss tour to visit the far ends. But, if you're up for a bit of exploring, its very easy and simple to do.If you're tall and looking at staying here, I'd simply suggest considering a King-sized bed.

When I read the reviews I was pretty nervous and disappointed, however when I got there and saw the room I was pleasantly surprised. PROS:- we had the one king bed room. I did not find the size of the room to be overly small like many of the reviews suggested. I was expecting a closet sized room but it was a comfortable size, definitely enough space for 2 people. - the decor is cool. Really modern looking, created a nice atmosphere.- Great location. Less than a block from Times Square, so you’re definitely within walking distance but you’re not subjected to the noise that you would be if you were staying directly in Times Square. - front desk staff were great - they use soap/shower gels/shampoo from a local company (CO Bigelow) which is based in NYC- very clean, very pleasant house keepers who do a great job. - bed was nice and comfortable - I got a great price through Priceline, (although it was still expensive.. it is Times Square!)- we had a mini fridge - 24 hour food and convenience store across the st and Connolly’s pub which is open until 4am. CONS:- my boyfriend was 6’3 and he couldn’t fit on the bed, his legs were hanging over the edge. - we found a very large, dead cockroach in the bathroom which the housekeeper promptly took care office - no coffee maker- had literally no view, when we opened the window it was the side of another building - depending on whether or not this is a pro or con, I think there’s an underlying risqué theme to this hotel as there was a kama sutra manual in the drawer beside our bed.

I arrived at 2:40pm and check in is at 3:00pm. The night before I called and ask if I can check in earlier if my room was ready and whomever at the time told me it was not a problem. So DANIELLA who was working the desk tells me I can’t check in until 3pm. I told her of my phone call from the night before and with the most smuggest dismissive attitude she tells me my room isn’t ready because I still have 20 minutes left to go….. Wow! I figured because they are in the hospitality business she would have checked to see if my room was ready but she couldn’t bother……So after I walked the streets for 25 minutes I check into my room because it was now “ready”. I have 4 guests arrive all mid twenties and BLACK. I get a phone call a few minutes later to ask me to come down to the front desk. First of all I don’t appreciate being summoned to a hotel’s front desk like I’m being called down to the principal’s office. So I oblige and I go. At this point it isn’t the smug DANIELLA it was some other gentleman. He takes it upon himself to tell me that I am not allowed to have a party in the hotel. I explain to him I’m a director here on business and he will see numerous people coming in and out of the hotel however it will only be 3 overnight guests. He said no problem. Now why he felt the need to tell the BLACK GUEST with his BLACK GUESTS that he cannot have a party, I am not sure. Not only wasn’t loud music being played, THERE WAS NO MUSIC BEING PLAYED AT ALL. I wonder if he gave all the other white guests that same warning……..So after more BLACK PEOPLE come in and out of the Night hotel. That became a problem and an investigation ensued…. I received another phone call from the principal’s office, I mean the reception desk. And now I am being yelled at by the same gentleman that called me the first time saying that I am having a photo shoot and I cannot do anything commercial. So once again I have leave the relaxation of my room to go back downstairs. The receptionist tell me that “my manager asked the people leaving my room what’s going on and they said they are coming from a photo shoot and you cannot do anything commercial here”. First of all the Night Hotel is too kind in crediting me the attendance of all the BLACK PEOPLE they see exiting their hotel to my stay. And what would make them want to stop all the BLACK PEOPLE and ask them “what is going on”? Was there too many BLACK PEOPLE there that you became alarmed??? So the manager that the receptionist was referring to was DANIELLA. So I explain to him again but now very sternly what I was doing. Yes I have to take headshots of people being I’m a director doing interviews. Then I start questioning him is it Night hotel protocol to ask their guest what it is they are doing in their hotel rooms or is this just a practice for BLACK PEOPLE?? Let me reiterate there are no noise complaints because there is no music or party going on. Fast forward this place double charges me for my stay. So instead of paying $800 for an offensive poor stay, I got the honor of paying $1600 and my bank account as I type this is in the negative. I called the Night hotel and DANIELLA did not want to accept responsibility for the double charge and told me to call my bank and hung up on me….. WHAT!? I called my bank and they confirm that they double charge me and I have to wait till tomorrow for them to refund me my money. So Night hotel, after that terrible racist experience you have given me, I wasn’t even going to write this. However! After you guys double charge me and DANIELLA was still rude to me and still didn’t try to fix my issue, well I can’t let that slide. You are not going to discriminate against me and then overdraft my bank account. The hotel NEEDS A BIG RENOVATION. The rooms have peeling wall paper, brown stained 90’s zebra tie-looking carpet. The TV was at least 10 years old, it did not even have HDMI port!I highly recommend everybody stay far away from this place.

The rooms are miniature. Some have minibars, some don’t. Some have robes, some don’t. The A/C is incredibly loud and no matter what I set it at, once the cleaning staff came in to tidy up, I’d come back and it would be blasting at 62°. The only thing going for it was that it was clean enough. The windows faced a brick wall. You will barely sleep because you hear every door on the floor shut as if it were in your room. It’s incredibly poorly lit. If you have plans to do your hair or makeup at all, best of luck. The overhead bathroom lighting is horrific and shadows your entire face. Restaurant/bar is tiny and super dark. There is one elevator that fits about 4 people. Staff was a bit judgy, but fine. WiFi didn’t work. I would never recommend this hotel. ",,Italia A,0,1.0

Bathroom under sink cabinet door opened, but refused to shut. One of three pillows had better nights ( eg smelled of other visitors ). No evidence where to turn off a floor lamp, so extinguished it at the socket. Bathroom floor/shower rug fraying. On the up side, linens were yummy.

I came here on business so I didnt have too many choices. Work recommended this hotel so I complied. I called early to see if I could get an early check in as I didnt feel up to roaming for 3 hours awaiting checkin. They were able to accomodate me but to an upgraded ""deluxe"" room for a small additional charge per night. Well I was like... 30 more for a deluxe room when I knew the rooms here were small to begin with? SURE! First impression of the hotel, the entrance is dark and recessed off of the street. Upon entering the hotel still dark, but this was expected. And also expected was the erotic art on the walls. I dont mind erotic art in the least, but if you're travelling with children, you may need to explain things you arent ready for. Checkin was super simple so onto the elevator.Ok this is small. You could get 4 people without luggage rather snugly. With luggage? Depends on how much luggage you have. 2 people and one carryon style wheeled bag can fit fine. Otherwise you'll likely want a solo elevator. The elevator is fast though.On to the room. Yes its a new york room, its going to be small. This room was no exception. It was small but functional. A few quibbles though with the room. There was no chair, only what appeared to be a stool at the desk. NOT comfortable at all to sit at to work but I managed. The bed was comfortable with a suitable summer duvet. The beds are short sheeted however which I noticed after tucking in for the night. I mean, its your mattress, you want feet all over it that have walked all across times square? The bathroom was well stocked with soft towels and nice shampoo and soap availableI did have an issue with the desk however. What is up with just having a stool to sit on at a desk? Not even a proper chair. This could have served as a footrest. It was hard and uncomfortable. I did come to this place for work,and I would have preferred going to the office than sitting on this uncomfortable stool chair. The staff were very friendly and accomodating, I asked for an early checkin and they stated that they had an upgraded room available. If this was the upgrade, I actually fear what my original room was going to be.People do complain that the rooms are dark. There are plenty of lamps in the room and they provided more than enough light for me, but I am fond of a more muted lighting, not the kind of lighting you can do surgery by. All in all, it suited its purpose. It had interesting decor and stuck to its dark theme. I cant beat its location for work though","Baltimore, MD","Burningisis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, MD</strong>",45,4.0

We asked for a pack n play months before arriving, 2 nights before arriving (note was never in the system), upon arriving - was not in room, and an hour after arriving! 2. The 90s music playing in the hallway is so loud! This was an issue for us because we had a toddler needing to sleep at 8- this may not be an issue for everyone.3. The light scones on the sides of the bed get so incredibly hot that you cannot turn them off from the light itself while in bed. Literally almost burned my finger! Beware. These need to be replaced.

There were knats on the bed pad which may have been due to open windows when the room was cleaned ( there are window screens that roll up/down to prevent that but ...) but it just felt better to start fresh and housekeeping was fine with that. Water pressure was good, air conditioner worked well but we opened the windows at night because the weather was great for it. The rooms are small yes but completely adequate for couples.

If your wanting to stay out of the hustle and bustle (hard to do in NYC) then this is not the location for you. It is walking distance to subway stations, Times Square, restaurants and theatres. Regardless, taxis are abundant in NYC and reasonably priced (based on Australian prices) so it is easy to get to where ever you want from the hotel. It's only 1 or 2 subway stops to Central Park. As for the hotel, it's lovely and very artsy. Front of house staff were a bit hit and miss. Sometimes they were pleasant and sometimes they were just really unhelpful. I was at this hotel in NOV/DEC 16 (however I have selected FEB 17 because trip advisor wouldn't let me select any 2016 months) and in a moon boot after a fall in another city, staff didn't seem to really want to help me grab the bags out of the taxi and the lady at the front desk was rude on arrival, her attitude came across as if she was superior. By about halfway through the stay they seemed to be a bit lighter in mood. I was staying there with my mum but if you were going to NYC with your other half I would highly recommend the hotel as its kind of hot and sexy in appearance and vibe.Rooms are small and the lighting is very low, so applying make up can be difficult.

The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. It was quiet on our floor, the only noise coming from the in-ceiling air conditioner and an air handling unit outside our window. We both had no problem sleeping even when we returned for an afternoon nap. There was no view from our window and we simply kept the curtain drawn.

But after 5 nights here, I am just disappointed. So lets start with what I absolutely love (aka the PROS:)-this place is Dark. Alot of people complained about the darkness of the rooms and the overall aesthetics, but if you are a fan of dark decor this place is awesome. I personally absolutely loved it over a bright airy room. The Black walls, and cool wall paper and overall vibe is awesome. -I like to travel without a lot of ""Pomp"" and prefer to be left alone as I come and go, so the fact that the stuff was not ""cheery and greeting me"" every time I walked through the door is fine with me. -I don't care about valet or parking when I uber in somewhere, so that was no issue. -Hotel location, for times square, pretty awesome. (Even though it says theater district, it's times square-My room was awesome(at first) I had a king room, and despite what many have said my room was plenty of size for me, and probably would have been fine for two. Bathroom good size, room comfortable. -IN short, if you want Westin, Intercontinental, or Marriott, then this is NOT the hotel for you. So the bad. (Aka the cons:)this is what sucks, cause I really really lvoed this place for about the first 36 hours I was here, then I started noticing things. -Housekeeping, they do not care at all. If I had to guess I would say they are allowed roughly 2-3 minutes per room for a turn. It was horribly inconsistent, and trash I accidentally left on the floor was not picked up. A take out food container bag, obviously garbage, sitting on top of the garbage can, was moved to the side of it and left. -Light bulb was burned out on arrival, ok, no biggie, they'll fix it on day 2. Nope. So I took the bulb out and placed it under the lamp, They put it in the cup with the wine key. Repeat this process everyday for 4 nights. Still no bulb. -Window, well I am pretty sure it is not supposed to fold down, also note that it could not close and latch this is two fold, one it made an incredible amount of street noise, and two, made the ac in-efficient. and then the ac...-Day 3 finds me back at my hotel after work. It is well over 80 degrees and blowing hot air. I call down and the front desk guy gives me a ludicrous story about cleaning the water tanks and it makes the ac stop working, but it will cool down shortly. Well it never does. Thankfully the window is broken, so I can at least get air, but god was it a hot, uncomfortable, loud, sweaty night. I complain via the expedia app the next day and about 4 hours later manager messages back saying it's been fixed and she credited my room, Im not sure how since I Prepaid on expedia, and have seen no refund. -Bathroom, well it has seen better days. The sink stopper was missing, but deep inside the sink is a toothbrush topper, so there is that, not to mention and earing on the shelf above. -if you have any kind of toiletry kit know the only place to open it is on the floor, toilet or in the bedroom, no space for anything in bathroom. -sink main faucet was loose and leaking and caulking job was horrible. -There are three light switches when you entered the room, 1 worked. The other two??? I have no idea. - There was a $5 bottle of fiji water when I checked in, I used it. They never replaced it once. -Furniture was a little beat up, but I could live with that. -as others mentioned, the walls are a little thin, and you hear every door, but really that's in most hotels. So I love quite a few things about this place, but as much as I would have given them 5 stars each day I stayed made this place less and less enjoyable. Aesthetics and style are 100% my style, I loved it, then sadly it showed it's colors. I would not come back here again. I would check out their sister property to see if it is as bad, but this one, sadly, I will not return. and just in case you are still booking, I was in room 68","Phoenix, Arizona","Clyde_Betts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",169,2.0

We had booked a Queen size room, but there had been an error with our travel agency who hadn't communicated our booking correctly to the hotel. For this reason the first night we were placed in a standard room (room 82) and then the hotel kindly upgraded us to a King (bigger than a Queen) for the following 2 nights. The standard rooms are tiny, the rooms as much as the beds, so if your partner like mine, is more than 6ft tall - don't even consider a standard room - you won't sleep as it's just too small and there's barely space in the room to have one large suitcase let alone two. Once we were in the right room, space was much better, as was light as the room was externally facing with two windows (room 57). I like the black and white theme of the hotel, it's different and very boutique - although it does make it testing to do your makeup in the morning lol. Front desk staff, particularly Patrick, are super and always there to help with any issues that you have (and share with you their hilarious renditions of overseas accents, his take on my British one was hilarious!) We didn't realise Breakfast isn't an option at this hotel as they only cater for evening meals, so if you want B&B option just be aware of this. Having said that though, as it's so close to Times Square, there are a mountain of options right on your doorstep for all types of eating options, we favoured Europa Café on the corner by the subway who do a great and reasonably priced breakfast.

I didn't receive a reply so I wrote back again and promptly received a response with an apology about a week before I left stating that I would be upgraded and I would also receive a complimentary bottle of red wine. When we arrived everything was in order as we had been promised. We did wait until 3pm for our room to become available but I expected that. Our room was spacious, very clean and beautifully decorated. The whole place has a very sleek and sexy vibe. I enjoyed the low lighting. The king bed that we were upgraded to was great but it was a little shorter than a normal bed... I hit my foot on the footboard a few times so taller people may have a hard time. I also found it odd that while in the shower, every two minutes or so the shower would start to turn off and then come back on... No big problem, just strange. The toiletries they provide are all natural and great. I would caution people from dining at the restaurant ""the red moon"" as it is deceptively expensive with very small portions. Dinner with one drink each ran us over $100 and the quality, while good, was not as great as what you could find for cheaper on nearby restaurant row. They also add on a service charge. Robert, who checked us in was really wonderful. He was very personable and friendly and took his time to chat with us and offer suggestions each time he saw us. One member of the front desk staff we encountered when we first tried to check in seemed quite snobbish and pretentious... Thank goodness his computer froze and we ended up with Robert... Much better service. It's not fun to pay a good bit of money to stay somewhere and then feel like you are looked down upon by the establishment you are paying. Thank goodness Robert understood that. My only other concern is I have been home for 4 days now and the payment has still not been debited from my account. I've stayed in a great many hotels and have not experienced this before so I'm quite sure it isn't my banks fault. Other than those minor concerns we really enjoyed our stay and had a wonderful time. I would recommend this hotel to my friends or anyone looking to stay near the theater district and would return in the future if the price is right!

Thankfully after discussing this with the front desk, I was not unnecessarily charged but it made me question the cleanliness of the establishment.

I couldn't recommend the gentleman who checked me in any more highly. He helped me sort out my room and was fantastic. The room ended up being very nice and quiet. It was great. THEN....I realized i hadn't remembered my US charging plug for my iPhone. And then it began....""We have lost too many of those""""You can leave your phone here at the front desk""""I'm sorry I can't let you take it"" These were some of the comments from the afternoon/evening person. I offered to leave my license. To leave an extra ""hold""'on my room in dollars to cover the precious $5 item I couldn't find in the surrounding shops that evening. Clearly disturbed, he exasperatingly have it to me and said ""clearly you aren't taking no for an answer"". ""I'm a grown up. I'll bring it back"" was my reply. So instead of relaxing in my room, I checked my charge to be sure he didn't have a stroke. Instead of recuperating from my travels, I checked my phone to see if I was fully charged. So the poor guy didn't have a stroke. Instead of enjoying my evening, I checked over and over and had to ration my battery life. I returned the plug about an hour later and was again told (by a new person) it wasn't possible for me to keep it overnight. I asked him to make sure the other guy knew it was back. After all, I wanted him to sleep well and not worry. So that evening, instead of being in touch with business and personal contacts, I rationed my charge. Not cool. To make it worse, on check out, they ASKED ABOUT THE PLUG. So, not only were they overwhelmingly concerned about the plug, the failed to note when it was returned. Despite my offering my room number upon return. So that's that. What began with a helpful and super efficient check in was completely ruined by someone with a bad attitude and disinterest in being helpful. Maybe you should realize travelers stay and want to rest. We sometimes forget things. In this case it was a super inexpensive item capable of making my stay more relaxing. Instead, it became the focal point of worry for me as i spent the evening charging and then worrying about work emails.The room- fairly clean. A little rough around the edges with the paper cover to shelf in bathroom coming off. Overall ok. Service score reflects a 5 for check in and a 1 for the other person.

It had the usual amenities (hair dryer, ironing board, iron) and free WiFi which worked fine for me, but no coffee maker. My room on the 2nd floor was quiet (faced an inner fire escape) from street noise or noise from other patrons. I heard nothing. The staff was friendly enough, but somewhat self-absorbed (e.g., I had to wait for them to look up from their phones to get checked in or to answer a question when I came to the desk). Nobody seemed to have a lot of energy to be helpful. The main issue with the room had to do with the ""night/goth"" theme. Everything was low lighting and dark. It made the room feel very dingy and difficult for me to read or to do work in the room. The HVAC was very erratic--either extremely cold or extremely warm. The thermostat seemed to take hours to adjust and was very noisy.That said, it was in a fantastic location near the Theatre District and lots of sightseeing and shopping. Easy to get to subways.

Mine did, but I couldn't see anything out of it. This has bothered me in the past, but wasn't really an issue here. My biggest issue was that there was a loud humming against the wall that the bed was on. It's possible that no one else would be bothered by this, but it did bother me a little bit.

My room was warm and very welcoming at the end of a long day, it had everything I could need - great coffee machine, everything was clean and well looked after by the maids while I was out. Importantly quiet (towards the side or rear, I've no idea) and not disturbed by other guests, I'm quite intolerant of other people I'm sort to say.The management are second to none and their guests contentment is clearly very high on their list.The happy hour was much appreciated and the food in the restaurant excellent, though be careful not to over order as the portions are big.Internet was fine - I could even access films on my iPad which normally I cannot do in hotels due to lack of speed/strength/whatever.The hotel couldn't be better placed for visitors and I felt safe at all times.As a thought maybe some continental breakfast could be supplied in the restaurant area - just a buffet roll/croissant type thing, to get us going in the morning. There is a great eating place opposite, looks a bit downmarket (to a Londoner, it may be normal) with huge selection served as a buffet that I tried once and was very good and also a couple of Irish pubs serving breakfast opposite so eating wasn't an issue.I'm looking forward to returning, I couldn't think of a better place to be - thank you all.",New York,"bikkie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",31,5.0

It was an express deal of the day and a great price (well under $100). I am a bit confused by the 4 star rating but overall our experience was good. The hotel is clean and décor is modern/goth. The rooms are small, they are clean and decorated nicely. Some reviewers stated that you could hear noise all night long from the streets, but we didn't experience that at all. Very quiet most of the time. It may sound silly, but really the only thing that would probably make me not want to book again here was the lighting in the room and bathroom. With every light on, it still never gets bright, and the light that they do have is pretty awful fluorescent lighting. It's important to me when getting ready to go out that I can see my face in the mirror properly (you know, the whole makeup thing). The lighting will make you look like a ghost and I found the lighting hard on the eyes. It didn't bother my husband quite as much but he agreed it was strange why they would design the hotel rooms that way. We could understand the lobby/hallways going with the dim/dark theme but the rooms should be different. Sounds very trivial, and honestly, in the end it's not a huge deal. It was a comfortable, clean place to stay with very pleasant front desk staff. Make sure to request a queen bed when you're booking.

We were excited. My wife picked the Night hotel based on price and location, but in hindsight we should have spent more for a better hotel. The only positives I can offer are that the hotel is located very near Times Square and the Rockefeller Center, and the Cranberrys restaurant across the street has great breakfast. When we first arrived, we were greeted by a very nice guy named Patrick, who checked our baggage and gave great directions on the subway, food, and how to get downtown. When we got back, the reality set in.Our room was on the 4th floor. It was about 8ft x 12ft in width and length with a double bed. This was my wife's fault for not requesting a bigger bed. Anyway, the room was very small and poorly lit. It also did not have a dresser. The lights worked on a dimmer switch which did not work very well. The bed had a light under it, supposedly controlled by the dimmer, but we couldn't turn it off. I had to unplug it. Additionally, all through the night, we were awaken by sirens and horns. Also, the hall was very noisy with other guest and kept us awake. Some noise prevention would have been nice.The bathroom was large, but the sink was tiny, with no counter. The modern shower did not have a lip or door, so water poured into the bathroom floor. The bathroom also did not have a fan, which is unpleasant in a 100 sq ft room. Additionally, the ironing board was very small and the iron poured water. The tv reception was awful and refreshed often.Worst of all was the length of the bed, combined with the footboard. I am 6'2"" tall, and as a result, did not fit. Anyone over 5'8"" would be uncomfortable, but I was miserable. The pillows were also terrible. I complained about this, but was told all of the beds were the same.Lastly, I would complain about the smoking in the hotel. It was bad. The halls smelled of smoke all the time. Having a pregnant wife, this was not ok. Even if she wasn't pregnant, it smelled terrible. I would not recommend this hotel in the slightest. I would gladly have paid double for a better place to sleep.","New York City, New York","742benm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",30,2.0

The first time we stayed at the 47th street location. W4 enjoyed stating there, but someone was playing the violin all night and kept us up.

When we called to book a 2 night reservation this past week week they did not have anything in computer so we decided to give the 4th Street location a try. The hotel was beautiful! We stayed in room 29 but unfortunately had issues as well. The air conditioning unit was not working and stayed locked on 78 the first night it was very hot in room. We spoke to the desk and they said they would lower it which we noticed they did. However, the next night it was right back up to being 78 and uncomfortable. The only other issue we had was with the restaurant Red Moon. The food was ok, but service was horrible. Everytime we needed our server whether it was to pay the bill or get a second drink we had to wave her down.

The decor of the hotel is pretty cool and what really saves this place is the service i have stayed at a very big hotel in NY before and the service was shocking. The staff genuinely seem to be interested and helpful, even when we came back and our door was open and they investigated - nothing was taken and it does appear from their records that we had left the door open, they still left a letter and bottle of wine in the room, which i think showed a genuine care. The issue is that the rooms are very dark with all the lights on and I was prepared for a small room but not quite prepared for how small they were, I did book a superior queen but i wasn't convinced we were in a superior queen as i am not sure how much smaller a room could be. I did find our room to be a little noisy but we were near Times Square in NY. The bathroom was nice with a good shower and it is in a great location.

Cool vibes, dark and hip. The desk clerks were not overly friendly, but not bad. When we got to our room, were were happy to have a front facing room, although it proved to be a bit loud at night. I didn't feel that the finishing touches were ""4 Star"" worthy - there was bad grout in the bathroom, chipped tiles, chipped paint - not awful, but not what I would expect from a four star hotel. We lost something, so at one point we were looking under the bed and mattress for our cord and (while the rest of the hotel was clean) these parts were just gross, including a condom wrapper. For us, our main issue was the bathroom. We had an ADA room so the shower was large with no doors. The water temperature wouldn't go above warm, so with the size of the bathroom, it was just too cold to shower. The manager was very accommodating and did everything she could to help us, even the maintenance guy was great. The only room we could move into was much smaller without a window, so overall, we felt very claustrophobic, not necessarily due to size, but size combined with all black walls, floors etc. It just wasn't our style. Again, the manager was great, but ultimately we ended up changing hotels. ",Indialantic,"97ashlees</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indialantic</strong>",0,2.0

Night is unique, interesting and comfortable.When you walk in, yes it is a tad dark, but the hotel is named ""Night"" but there are all these lovely candles everywhere that give plenty of light!

I am pretty laid back, and I had some work to do on my laptop, so I just hung out in the lobby. Beautiful leather couches!! But within 5 minutes my room was ready. Check in was 10 minutes of that - loved it! When I got up to my room, and opened the door, it did slam into the mini fridge, but this is a new York hotel room. It is supposed to be small. But with the black and white motif, and the floor to ceiling curtains, it made the room seem a lot bigger then it was. The bathroom was small, but it had a window that could open, which was nice! And the toiletries were really top notch!! I was concerned when I couldn't find the ice bucket, but all you have to do is call downstairs and someone delivers it!! And the room has a doorbell. Which is also a nice feature.  Other little touches that i appreciated? Well - every other hotel I have ever stayed in has a bible in the night stand. This hotel had the Karma sutra!

Saw many folks commenting on how it was so dark inside that they had to use flash lights and blah blah blah...they must have had vision issues, we never had an issue. It was darker but that was to give the feel of ""night"". With the lights above the doorways it is plenty to see with. The rooms were roomy and the bed was amazing! Will deff be staying again!

The hotel was completely unhelpful - saying I should feel lucky they decided to give me a small refund but would be keeping the bulk of the charge. So, I had to file a charge-back with my bank - who verified the incorrect details used and the fact that my bank records show I was not in the USA anytime around this incident. The case was then awarded in my favor and my money returned.One would think that would be the end, yet, despite the above - this hotel continues to aggressively pursue me for the money, filing claim appeals again and again. 7 months later, I am still filing papers with my bank to defend against the hotels actions.

Pros:- Location, location, location. Half a block to heart of Times Square, one block to Times Square subway hub.- Room décor is kinda swanky with the dark wallpaper- Not AS expensive as some of the other hotels in the Times Square area- They brought us ice pretty fast when we asked for it (yes, I had to call this out as a pro since I couldn't find that much else)Cons:- Room is tiny. I found myself tripping over my luggage and bumping into my SO constantly.- The room furniture is obviously dated, since the theme is dark/night, which causes each chip to show up visibly.- Bed was really cheap, uncomfortable, and not well though out. They took an average mattress, and put a ~3 inch cheap memory foam pad above it. When you put your weight on it, the foam pad deformed. The best way to describe it is imagine sitting in the center and having the edges of the foam pad curl up. The result was a bed that is way too soft that you sink into, offers little/no support, and heats up. In addition, the mattress protector they used was way too small because of the foam pad they added, causing it to ride up all the time. Oh, and the mattress protector was pretty dirty in the corners/along the edges, making me wonder if they actually wash it.- Doors are made of paper. There was a couple in the hall talking one night at 2AM (not even that loudly) and you could hear every single word they were saying as if the door wasn't even there.- Stairs need updating. They're made of stone/marble but are sagging/deforming where people most oftenly step, making it easier for someone to slip. We were on the 2nd floor so we used the stairs often.- Still felt expensive for the product that we got...P.S. Be careful not to get this location confused with Night Times Square just 2 blocks away. We originally pulled up to Night Times Square and realized it was the wrong hotel after the front desk couldn't find our reservation. Was an embarrassing D'oh moment.","Seattle, Washington","releaseYourself</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",6,3.0

This is your place. Extreme sensitivity to light? Totally color-blind? No problem. Do you go to Disneyland just to hang out in entrance for The Haunted House or Hollywood Tower ride? You'll never want to leave.The Night Hotel strives to be mysterious and dark. It certainly is dark. On a sparkling Manhattan morning, you can't see in the door. Coming in from Times Square at 10PM, your eyes have to adjust to the darkness. There's no colour used in the hotel décor. For some this is trendy or romantic. I found it depressing.My room had only one window facing a closed gap between buildings, far enough below the top that no light ever entered. Black and white bedding, carpet, black furniture and outsize thistle print wallpaper accentuated the gloom. The only colour came from what I brought in. At least the bathroom towels are white.The all-black shower and bath floor undesirably accentuated the dull brown dirt that is in every bathroom tile's grout. Here, the brown jumped out as contrasting colour; even the dirt is brighter than the room! I expect the bathroom was cleaner than many hotel showers but what dirt there was *showed* in an unexpected and unpleasant way.I cannot fully describe the odd psychological effect of my stay. The room should have been very comfortable: soft bed, quality toiletries, fluffy towels. However, the entire hotel was so dark, I couldn't wait to get out in the morning and held off until the last possible minute before coming back.I doubt I'll return.","Del Mar, California","tigerdogtoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Del Mar, California</strong>",18,4.0

Excellent location in the heart of Times Square. The hardest part was driving there. We drove to NY and once you get down to Time Square all the construction etc made it a little difficult to navigate. They offer discounted parking at Myers lot around the corner. The hotel itself had a nice décor, the rooms were clean, a decent size (for NY) and came with all your usual amenities. The elevator to me was very tiny, but I’m guessing it’s just a result of squeezing everything in such a tight space. They offered bag check so we could leave or bags there until later and there is a lovely restaurant attached in the lobby. I had two very minor negatives, but that is because I am a little picky. One, the décor being so dark made the lighting in the room poor for us girls putting on makeup. And two, the shower drainage was poor and I hate standing in water puddle. Had we been staying longer than a night, I would have asked that it be cleaned. PRO: Best part of our visit was Patrick. He was extremely helpful, friendly and quick with check-in. He explained close by sightseeing options and gave us a great tips regarding the Stature of Liberty and taking the subway. It’s been a long time since I have had such genuinely good service. He wasn’t just pretending. He truly cared about taking care of us and ensuring we had a pleasurable stay.

There was one tiny window looking at another building/alleyway that was covered by dark curtains. It feels like you're in coffin. The sheets and pillows smelled, the air conditioner was loud, and did I mention the attitude of the staff? The closet in the room had no light (or light anywhere near it) so it was totally unusable. I called down to ask about it and the guy at the front desk's answer was ""yeah, that's the ambiance of the hotel..."" The electrician came up and installed mini stick on emergency lights so you could sort of see what was going on in the 2 square foot box of a closet.

Although no prude by any means the photos are a little more erotic than I've seen in any other hotel I've ever visited. As I told one friend, it reminded me of the movie ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Don't let first impressions dictate your stay, however. The artwork adds to the character this hotel is trying to present. It works with the style and decor.The hotel is tastefully done in black and white, and although my room could use a bit of paint touch-up, I was quite happy with it during my two night stay. The room was large enough by NYC standards, with a nice comfortable bed and modern looking bathroom, also decorated mostly in black. The fifth floor room was situated on the back side of the hotel, and very little street noise was heard, even though the hotel was situated just half a block from 7th Avenue.Kudos to the hotel desk staff, as all were very nice and welcoming. The whole staff seemed to be very eager to please. There is a very nice restaurant just off the lobby, Red Moon. Although I usually avoid the hotel restaurants, I decided to give this a try, since Red Moon specializes in sushi, one of my favorite meals. The price is also excellent, again, given for New York City. The sushi was above average and staff very accommodating. I've stayed in many hotels in the Times Square/Theater District and wouldn't hesitate to stay here at the Night Hotel again. It is very comparable to the my other favorite stays here in this area. My only complaint was the $10 service charge for wifi, which I avoided due to piggy-backing my internet by tethering from my phone. Many of the other hotels I've used in NYC has free wifi, which could factor in my decision the next time.","Carlisle, Pennsylvania","Terry H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carlisle, Pennsylvania</strong>",31,4.0

Less than a block away from Times Square and right in the middle of the action. However, that's about all this hotel had going for it.My biggest issue with the hotel was the housekeeping staff. We were barely in the room so there was very little need for housekeeping. Since we kept many personal belongings in the room, when we left we put our ""do not disturb"" sign up. A couple of times when we were in the room sleeping late the house keeping staff blatantly ignored the sign and tried to force entry in the room. Had it not been for the dead bolt they would have walked in on us several times. There was even a very awkward exchange that lasted at least 2 minutes with a house keeping attendant who tried to force herself in our room when we were half dressed and I had to convince her that I did not need any service.The worst part of it all was when we came back from lunch and caught two housekeeping attendants in our room(despite the do not disturb sign). They were very nervous when we caught them walking out. Their excuse was that we had supposedly called and requested service(which we didn't). The thing about it was, when we caught them, they were leaving the room and even if we had called for service, nothing had been done in the room when they were leaving out. The manager never even got back to me when I called to complain and they gave me some bad excuse but never truly explained what they were doing in our room.It wasn't bad enough to ruin our trip but it came close. The hotel is tiny and dark. There is no color anywhere and everything is black and white. There is one, very tiny elevator that can't fit more than 3 people.The rooms feel more like a dorm than an actual hotel room. Our room had a tiny window in the corner with no view at all. You have no idea of what's going on outside until you actually leave the hotel. The room was very small and a bit dirty. There were no bugs or anything but the white in the black and white decor had seen better days. The carpet was not longer white, but a dingy cream color. The same goes for the white in the very tacky wallpaper. There was a big orange stain on the carpet in the corner. There is no dresser, no microwave and no fridge in the room. There is only a motion-sensored mini bar that is stocked with overpriced drinks and alcohol. We took a beer out for a while to make place for our water and the hotel tried to charge me $10!The beds were comfortable but there was a weird feather-filled mattress cover that was super uncomfortable because many of the feathers were poking through. It felt like a bunch of toothpicks.Where most hotel rooms have a Bible or at least magazines this hotel had a weird sex book in the drawer. Just one more thing to add to the weirdness of this place.The bathroom was tiny as well and only had a shower.There was free wifi, which was a perk I believe since we used booking.com but I believe the wifi for all other guests was $10 per day.Got it for a great price and can't beat the location but I will never stay here again.

All staff from the hotel and Red Moon Restaurant off the lobby were uniformly pleasant and accommodating. One should note that the King sized beds are shorter than standard king beds, which is definitely is problematic for tall individuals. By the fourth night (I am a slow learner), I learned to avoid stretching my legs and violently stubbing my toes on the footboard (so much for style over substance). Aside from being too short with a stupid footboard, the mattress and bedding were among the most comfortable anywhere. Our room was very dark, with two dark grey walls and black tile in the bathroom. Our friends had a room with a greater proportion of white background wallpaper, and it was not so bad in that room because it felt a little bigger even though it wasn't because it was less dark. The onsite restaurant was very good, reasonably priced, and I highly recommend the coconut curry crab soup. The shower was narrow, but pleasant with a rainfall shower head, and the water was nicely and reliably hot. The bathroom mercifully had an elongated toilet. It was quiet at night. Nice selection of cable TV stations, including multiple HBO and On Demand, which was very nice. The Cranberry Cafe across the street is an excellent place to grab a cheap and delicious breakfast. Starbucks is practically next door. This hotel is next door to the Millenium Broadway, an ideal location for attending the theatre. Good service and amenities - and location - ultimately outweighed the limitations of a small room, and I would stay here again.Another note for parents - the hotel theme is sex. It doesn't really hit you over the head, but the photos on the wall are mildly suggestive about on par with what you might see at Abercrombie and Fitch - nothing explicit, but if a tasteful, stray bare breast offends your sensibilities, you might want to choose another hotel.

The room was spotless and nicely decorated. The bed was super comfortable, though we didn't really end up sleeping much;-) This is the kind of hotel that definitely puts you in the mood. Loved that we each got both one free drink at the bar for completing a very short survey as well. Even though the complimentary drink tickets were all gone, Alejandro (I think that's his name; he may have been the manager) escorted us personally to the bar to confirm that we receive our drinks.

NY (on 45th St) does not have rooms with 2 beds. I may have screwed this up because I was surprised to learn our room did not have the 2 beds I needed. I admit it, Im cranky when I travel. Patrick at the front desk refused to allow it. He killed me with kindness. Apologizing profusely for what was likely MY mistake and doing everything he could to remedy it. Nick at the door couldn't help us enough. He was quick about getting luggage, valet, etc. This was my first impression of the hotel: a friendly, calm, patient, understanding, considerate staff that will go to great lengths to accomodate. Half a block off of Times Square, inviting exterior. Valet parking at $55 made me cringe, but it was the night before Thansgiving so...Decor throughtout is black and white, with low lighting. But you dont need night vision goggles as some reviewers lead you to believe. It was like being in a fine dining restaurant. Except the wall art. Its a bit risque, but not the porn some reviewers insinuated. Its very avant garde and reminded me of Abercrombie ads. We ended up with a king size room on the 8th (top, I believe) floor. Yes, the elevator is tiny, but, um...who cares? It was very quick and the three of us had no trouble getting in with our luggage. By NYC standards, the room was average size for the price point. We've stayed at Dream Downtown where rooms were remarkably similar (in size and decor, though their bathroom was a little larger) and double the price and Element, similar in price and not much bigger (same size elevator too!) King bed seemed smaller than standard king, but it was comfy and 6'4"" fiance managed just fine. Given some reviews I honestly expected to have to bring my own candles. What are you people talking about?? Nightstand lights on either side of the bed, running lights under the bed, and track lighting above the bed. Some people complained about ""the view"". What do you expect?? Note to out of towners: NYC is a ""concrete jungle"" made up mostly of buildings. Rooms with ""a view"" are always a gamble. To better your chances, choose a hotel higher than 8 floors.Took the survey they provided and used our free beer/wine ticket at the lounge. House music (which I happen to love, so cool for me), also dimly lit (think swanky nightclub.) Staff there too was great! Fast service, friendly, didnt even charge us for teenager's Shirley Temple. Do you know how rare it is to find caipirinhas on the menu? And even rarer when they are made well? Love the lounge for this.What else...water pressure in the shower was good. Better quality amenities like vegetable soap. Kept our bags locked up for us after check-out (which was at noon.) And they have branded chocolate bars. We had a great day and would not hesitate to book there again.

The bar downstairs is great for meeting and having a quick bite to eat and relax.

A Great location We arrived and the lovely Lauren booked us in, she was nice and welcoming. The first room had a dodgy door catch, half the lighting system didn't work (you need lights in this place) and was generally grubby. I went down to Lauren and she immediately apologised and switched us to another room.It got worse with the second room. The door latch plate had a screw missing and was flapping about. At this point we didn't spend 2 minutes in this also grubby room as it just wasn't secure so went again to the front desk. Lauren had finished but Jesse was there. I felt he had a bee in his bonnet from the start. He was rude and made things slow and awkward (he admitted they were in between maintenance guys) but he did upgrade us to a bigger room at the front on level 2. This room was bigger but awful! Loads of damage around this also grubby room, the toilet roll holder was hanging off and the sink was smashed. The window was so noisy, at first I thought it was just the New York noise but upon inspection the window frame was loose and the window section has popped out and the seals were either missing or worn. I managed to pop the window back in to seal the noise as my wife had had enough of swapping rooms and said to just grin and bare it as it was only a base to sleep in but then the air con turned on. OMG like a banging jet engine with a goat inside kicking it every so often to make it work!!! So off I was again to the front desk! Jesse was present and refused to come and see the damage so I went and took photos. He then said he would send ""someone"" to look into the window etc. Nobody came. I rang down to the desk as it was now getting late (midnight) and we were very tired from traveling so Jesse turned up but refused to look at the damage in the shower room so I said about fixing the window but then the air con was awful and it just so happened to turn on when he was in the door. I said this is unacceptable so back down to the desk for another room change!! Finally room 53, a downgrade but was quiet and ok air con was still a little noisy but ok, the sink had a crack but was ok, the walls were scratched and damaged and most importantly there was no safe! But at this stage we needed to be asleep and we realised that it wasn't going to get any better so we stayed put! The next day we spoke to Patrick, a very nice chap and helpful. He said he would try his best to get a discount with his manager, he gave us two free drinks at the bar. We came in after a day's walking and Patrick was still on duty at the main desk. We spoke and he said his manager had given us a 15% discount which we felt was a mediocre gesture! The next day we had a letter slipped through under our door from the manager saying that we will receive a 15% discount upon checkout. The next letter was the bill pushed under the door with 15% added onto the bill so again I had to go down to the front desk with complete and utter dismay and point out yet another mistake.This was rectified by Patrick and we were glad to check out! Throughout the process I must say Patrick was very helpful.The hotel is in a good location but I recommend go over the road to the Hyatt. Starbucks is a stones throw! You will need Starbucks as no tea coffee making facility's in the room. The door men were rubbish if they were there! Never paying attention! The lift was old and very clunky had a mind of its own only one lift to service 9 floors and is tiny! Felt dangerous!We would never stay here again and I would also advise others to stay well clear.","Staffordshire, United Kingdom","Alrightchief</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staffordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",39,2.0

I took my girlfriend to New York City for her birthday, and wanted it to be really special since she had never been before. When it came to the hotel, I could not have picked a more perfect place. So unique, so SEXY (definitely an intimate little boutique hotel for couples), and I can't stress enough how PERFECT the location is. It is a half a block away from Times Square, and so close to Central Park and many subway stations. Starbucks right to the left of the hotel. The staff also was incredible. I wish I could remember names. They all were wonderful. They sent up a free bottle of champagne as a birthday present for my girlfriend, and later on even stopped by to give us some chocolates and a weather report for the next day. They brought our luggage up to our room and were so courteous and helpful when it came to helping us find our way around town. We also did a survey on the hotel which took all but 2 minutes and we got 2 free drinks out of it at the bar downstairs! The hotel also smells amazing in the lobby and hallways-don't know what it is! My only complaint would be how tiny the rooms are and they have no view, but it's New York City. You're going to have small rooms anywhere you go! Thank you Night hotel for a wonderful stay!

That was until 2am when a group of loud rowdy men started shouting and at 4am when a group of loud women started shouting.I needed to be near Penn station so the hotel was the most affordable I could find but was very pricey considering there was no tea/coffee, no breakfast and NO FREE WIFI!!

Robert on the concierge welcomed us warmly and was helpful throughout our whole stay. There was a mix up with the rooms on the 1st night as we arrived very late. But the morning after Jackie Kelley, made sure that all of us were in the right rooms and that we made the most of our stay. Simon also was a great help everyday greeting us with smile and advice on what to do, now the other stuff.One thing you need to remember in NYC is that space is a premium. The rooms in the night hotel are amazing the design is great and perfect for you to relax in after a day exploring the city, and all it has to offer. Top tip the Cranberry Deli over the road is great food 24hrs a day.The location of the hotel is fantastic near to time square and central park all in walking distance. To be honest Cabs are a waist of time as with all the traffic lights and roadworks you can walk or take the subway quicker and cheaper.At night we had drinks in the cocktail bar which is a great place to relax and unwind and the cocktails are amazing.Yes there are lots of hotels in NYC but as a 1st timer in the big apple i couldn't have had a better time and this was made the more special by Robert, Jackie and Simon and all the staff at the Night Hotel.

I would just like my very tiny hotel room to be clean. There were hairs everywhere, and uncleaned, sticky coffee stains under the bedside table. The towels always seemed to have hairs on them (way too long to be mine), and the housekeeper forgot on 3 of our 4 nights to bring washcloths to replace the ones she took away. Now, I get that this is New York, and there's this reputation that folks are unfriendly here. I've never found that to be the case, actually, but I expect hotel staff to always be friendly. They get paid for that. Not at the Night Hotel, however. The front desk staff was indifferent to our arrival. The desk agent at check in had all the warmth and personality of an ATM machine.I've stayed at ""boutique"" hotels in NYC before.

The reception staff we're fantastic and always helped us with any questions we had about the city and where to go. The location is perfect, as you walk out you have Starbucks on your left, a new york deli to your right across the road and a 30 second walk to your left is Times Square! You are in the middle of everything and really close to many subway stations too, which we used a lot to get to places around NYC. The room itself was lovely, we were greeted to a beautiful King bed with a nice themed room with wallpaper and carpet, big enough TV and 2 windows facing the street for some fresh air. The bathroom is small and can get quite warm when having a shower, but its easily fixed when you open the door. It was very clean, fitted our 2 large suitcases with room to move around, daily housekeeping was also great and attentive. The bed and pillows were so comfortable you would instantly fall asleep! You could hear a bit of street noise (mainly sirens), in the mornings and night, but its not too loud to bother you, after all, it is NYC. The bar and restaurant downstairs was fantastic! We became quite familiar with the girls behind the bar and they would always remember what we were drinking without us saying anything. They were always happy to talk and have a conversation with a smile on there face, they're awesome, very lovely people. There was paid wifi in the rooms, and free wifi in the downstairs lobby.

It has put a sour taste in my mouth for ever bidding in this area again.This hotel is not to be confused with the Night Hotel Times Square, which appears to be a considerably different property.Upon checkin, we were told we were receiving an ""upgraded"" room on the second floor. The lobby was small and dark, and the agent was nice enough. Upon arriving in the room we were immediately confused. This looked like a hole in the wall. Literally, the room was the size of a closet. The interior was dark, very dark. Depressing dark. But after a long flight from Seattle, we didn't want to argue, so we decided to go to bed.Trying to sleep in this madhouse was a different story. We could hear a couple fighting in the hall. Screaming, punching, hair pulling type fighting. Upon trying to contact the front desk (who was just one flight of stairs away) we got no answer. The screaming continued through the night. From the other side we could hear a different couple having ""alone time"". This is the type of place you would bring a girl for hire.Upon further inspection, we could see the filth we had slept in. Stains on the mattress, blood on the mattress cover, mold in the bathroom. It is deplorable that a general manager or owner would allow guest to stay in these conditions.In the morning, it was decided that we could not stay here for two more nights. A quick call to Priceline and some photo evidence of the condition of the room we were granted a full refund. This is NOT a four star property.

Rooms are compact - this is not a hotel where you practice your tango in the room - but compensated for by excellent location and friendly helpful staff. Rooms are individual in configuration so discuss your requirements. If you sleep lightly, rooms facing 45th may not be your preference - morning dump trucks will save you the alarm call and ensure that you enjoy NYC's early start. This is (as the song lyrics go) ""the city that never sleeps"". Triple-glazing may be an option for the future and as Night Hotel presumably have no jurisdiction over the street, urban living has its characteristics.Very friendly staff (from Mr Brito in reception) to the chatty bar staff (who will join in conversation and are always ready to adapt opening hours to your liquid requirements) to the discreet night security guard in the corner (the silent smiling Buddha of the establishment) providing a friendly welcoming nod.

I was particularly excited about this hotel as it was the most unique one I've ever booked. It was indeed exciting! So we check in, nice pleasant service. As we enter the room, we are immediately taken aback by the size of the room - tiny! As was the bathroom. So we digest this aspect of the room, and sitting on the bed, notice the imperfections and what appeared to be stains of soup on the wall, but could've been anything. Then came the killer punch. No word of a lie, a pile of toenail clippings right next to the bin, on the carpet. Yes, eew indeed! It was time to return to reception. Admittedly, the gentleman at reception appeared as shocked and disgusted as us. He even took a picture to presumably show his boss - I wish I had taken a picture too to show you guys! Anyhow, we got upgraded the next night onwards, to a slightly larger room. The room still lacked any tea/coffee making facilities. I must admit, there was always a wonderful aroma when you enter the hotel, and the character on ground floor was still curiously attractive even until the last day. If it wasn't for these two factors, it would definitely have been one star rating. I would most certainly not stay here again. The toenail clippings on the floor is enough to keep us away!","Manchester, United Kingdom","musap2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",12,2.0

The BEDS were SOOOOO Comfortable and after nearly 25 hours in transit from Oz to LA to NYC this was a DREAM.

Another plus is the service: very friendly, attentive staff, one of whom provided me with a code/password for free lobby WiFi, which also worked in my room (otherwise, I would have had to pay for it).Also on the plus side: very clean room, and quiet—though I've read complaints about noise from the nightclub downstairs, I had no trouble sleeping in my room on the seventh floor (comfy bed, too). Air-conditioning was a bit loud, so I just adjusted the thermostat accordingly to keep it from going on and off all night.Minuses: Tiny room; I've stayed in many New York hotels, and this might have been the smallest room I've ever slept in. I was a solo visitor so it was bearable, but I can't imagine how two people could manage. Also, there is only one elevator, and it's very slow.Finally, the sexed-up, goth-like decor must have been someone's idea of hip and chic several years ago, but it's now just, well...tacky. The furniture in my room seemed a bit tired around the edges, and carpeting was threadbare in some spots.

The obvious advantage of staying at The Night hotel is its location. You are within a few yards of Time Square, near to the Ticket Booth. Access to the subway system is great and the staff were all very friendly and helpfulIf you want advise on anything ask the concierge. We did and weren't disappointed.As has been stated by others the rooms are small but adequate, unless you intend spending all day and night in them and let's face it, you're in the big apple, so why would you.Facilities inside the rooms were limited to a decent TV, Bose radio and shower. A coffee machine would be niceWe didn't use the bar or restaurant as food and drinks are expensive and there's an Irish pub across the road that provides better valueWe arrived early so left our luggage in the secure room. Again this wasn't a problem.The only real criticism I have is that wifi is not free in the room, there's a $10 charge per day. Although free in the lobby areas, wifi should be free in every hotel these days. Hey it is 2014 after all!Checkout was quick and painless.

Very dark and seductive decor with some very interesting pictures on the walls and a Karma Sutra book in replace of the usual bed side bible. Great staff, comfortable beds and fab location. The hotel is very small in comparison to other hotels in NYC but that's what attracted us in the first place. The staff were friendly and very knowledgeable, assisting with questions and offering suggestions.The only draw back was the city noise. We were on the 8th Floor and could hear the cities activities. Tbh, it didn't bother us too much as we were sleeping well due to the busy days sight seeing. The complimentary toiletries were not the best but if like me you want to take the minimum in liquids, there's plenty of places to buy toiletries such as dwane reeds, cvs or walgreens. There's one on pretty much every corner! The hotel has a great bar that offers cocktails at a decent price and good measures too.

However the black design made everything very dark and you almost can`t see that the hotel was not updated for some time. The weather was very cold at that time in New York, but for some reason the air conditioning was switched on when we have arrived and it took some time to figure out how to warm up the room.

The first room (56) I stayed in had a broken shower and an air-con unit outside of the window making noise all night. Staff were great, apologised and moved me to another room (51). This room however had a problem with the window not shutting properly meaning that cold air (-2 outside) was permanently coming through into the room and I had to stuff towels around it to minimise the impact. Reported it to reception the next morning and was advised that maintenance would come and fix it. They never did and my towels were in the same position when I got back that evening.

This hotel has a great location for seeing Broadway shows. It's just a half block from Times Square. It is modestly priced, which is the primary reason I booked the hotel, and the savings enabled us to spend an extra night in the city. We had a room with a window to the back. It was very quiet. Absolutely no noise issues at any time of the day. The hotel is clean and feels safe. The hotel staff could be helpful, but you have to ask. The first night we arrived, explained the airline lost our luggage, and the only response we received was crickets chirping. There is a Walgreens down the street, but still, no help volunteer or concern expressed.Now to the not so good points: this hotel promotes itself as the ""sexiest hotel in America,"" which I thought would amuse my girlfriend during our weekend getaway. I guess sexy is dark, and by that I mean pitch black, dark. This hotel has no lights -- anywhere. And true to its name, it feels like it is night 24 hours per day. My girlfriend and I felt like falling asleep every time we walked into the hotel, even if it was 10:00 a.m. and we'd just come back from coffee. Sexy is also small. We had the standard room, and I expected the room to be small like most NYC hotel rooms, but if you're going to market to couples, then a room should be big enough for two people, as opposed to the single business traveler. There was about two feet of closet space, the rest of the small closet taken up by the refrigerator for the room. There were no drawers to unpack your clothes, and the only place for your luggage, which could be unpacked only on an ""as needed basis"" was right in front of the closet door, meaning you couldn't ever open the closet door because it was always blocked by your unpacked luggage. Also, other than about 8 inches of space on the other side of the bed, the space in front of the closet was also the only open floor space in the room. So, if you stay here, don't expect to stand or walk in your hotel room, and of course, there is no room for even a chair. The bathroom was also dark and tiny. It was so dark that my girlfriend couldn't use the bathroom mirror to get ready because she couldn't see anything. The bathroom had no fan, so this hotel is only for established couples who are totally secure in their relationship. Once you open that bathroom door, any unpleasantness is going to come pouring out into the tiny room. Finally, the designer of this hotel was apparently a big fan of the movie Eyes Wide Shut, because throughout the hotel the only lighting comes from black and white, back-lightened photographs that depict soft-porn scenes that seem to have been inspired by Eyes Wide Shut. Suffice it to say, because of these photographs alone, this isn't a hotel you want to take your kids to. So, if your definition of sexy is staying in a phone booth that's been painted black and is lighted by only a cell phone screen displaying a ""hot"" photo from Eyes Wide Shut, then this hotel is for you. For everybody else, this hotel is good for an amused smirk -- at least until you bump into something, then you'll have a different expression.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Bluetornado0811</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",24,3.0

The good-The hotel is in the most amazing location, right in the heart of everywhere but not on the main roads. The room is wonderfully designed, very cool and funky. I arrived to find a complimentary bottle of wine welcoming me to the hotel. What's bad: Its a hotel that likes to portray itself as a party hotel for trendy people. I would like to think I am one of those, being youngish and working in media. However even I have to say that I thought this hotel was pompous. The staff acted like they were the models in the sex-rated photos on the walls. They failed to acknowledge me on arrival, carried on talking to each other, looking at themselves in the mirror until I announced I was checking-in and coming straight off a flight from London. Down the corridors they played loud nightclub style music, which is fine but you can really hear it in your bedroom. Kind of sounds like a party going on next door once your door is shut. The rooms are super dark, very sexy yes but too dark to put your make-up on in, read a book etc. and no ability to turn them up. Also I was missing a coffee and tea machine in the room. I woke in the morning to find not even a bottle of water to drink. Although I think the idea might have been to have opened the complimentary bottle of wine and carried the party on early in the morning!

Then, instead of reimbursing me for the $500+, they charged me for another $500 instead of crediting me it. Luckily, I looked at my card statement and noticed it. It took about 9 phone calls to the credit card companies and hotel to get this straightened out. The hotel had to call the card company and at first only got rid of the $500 charge rather than changing it to a credit.

When I say small, I mean small. The lobby itself is compact so don't be surprised/disappointed when you come in. The rooms and hallways reminded me of our last cruise ship vacation. The benefit however; is a no-nonsense hotel lobby with no ""loiterers"".  After reading tons of reviews, we decided to stay in Time Square for our first time to NY to celebrate our 20 yr. anniversary. Some said the hotel was like a nightclub, and I did not want to be around a bunch of young club-hoppers, but we were pleasantly surprised by the guests. They ranged in age, but we rarely ran into other guests despite the compact size of the hotel. The decor is exactly as the pics show, black and white, sexy, and catered for adults. This was just what we wanted. We didn't want to stay in a ""family"" hotel with kids because we came to NY to escape our young kids. The hotel doesn't discriminate I'm sure; if you want to bring your kids you can, but it’s definitely a grown-up’s place. No real “security” at the hotel, and sometimes, no doorman. Maybe it would raise prices to have one full-time..hmm. The only noises I could hear from other guests at night was their doors closing. Once closed, I could not hear anything else--thankfully :-). We didn't notice any problems with the elevator speed. The hotel has only 9 floors, so I didn't expect them to be as fast as the WTC or anything. I will say the room we stayed in is starting to show some minor wear. The bathroom tiles were missing grout in some areas, and as other reviewers mention, the lighting was a challenge even though our bathroom had a window. The wood on the bathroom vanity has endured some water damage, and the caulking had a bit of mold...nothing that a little elbow grease could not have fixed. The room itself was good (room 86). The bed was a little ""saggy"" for my taste, but I didn't lose any sleep over it. As warned by other guest reviews, we didn't touch the minibar due to it being ""tripped"". A full length mirror in the bathroom and room would be helpful both functionally and aesthetically. Graciously, the hotel sent us a bottle of Champagne to celebrate and allowed us a bit of an early and late check out as a courtesy. All in all, they were very good to us.  The only reason the review lost a star was due to housekeeping. I was a bit disturbed to find that on our first day of check-in, they left one used lotion bottle from the previous guest(s). That kept running through my mind because that was something that I could see, but what else was missed that I couldn’t see? Were the sheets/pillows washed etc.? That is a no-no in my book! Also, the next day while we were out, housekeeping came in to clean as normal and the same hair that was on the countertop and sink was also there when we returned. I was not happy about that either. I'm sure the housekeeping staff is in need of a refresher meeting.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would recommend it if others wanted to stay in a discrete location geared towards adults near the buzz of the city. The location was awesome...only a block from all the action. Close to the 42nd street subway entrance that you will quickly become familiar with if you decide to ride the subway. Patrick gave us a quick Subway 101 crash-course, and we were subway pros by day 4. Patrick also recommended a place called Junior’s down the street for breakfast and it was excellent. He was very nice, although I'm sure us ""pesky"" tourists ask him the same questions over and over, he obliged us like we were old annoying friends of his :-).","Los Angeles, California","Seashellstew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",33,3.0

Our 1st impression of this hotel was very nice & modern. The desk staff were friendly & helpful. Top marks goes to Walter the concierge he was very knowledgable & nothing was any trouble for him. He even organised for a bottle of champers as it was my birthday while we were out there. Our room as a lot of reviews have said isn't the largest of rooms but it was very clean & tidy & had everything you need also the bed was so comfortable I never wanted to get out of it. There were a couple of down sides I found to this hotel which weren't major but just annoyed us a little one being the lifts.........they are so SLOW & don't always to stop on your floor which can get a little bit irritating & the other was our door card we had to have it refreshed 6/7 times & after you have waited for the lift once to have to wait 3 times can be rather time consuming. The other thing I thing could improve hotel is free wifi throughout not just in public areas. I am a light sleeper so as we had a front king room on the 5th floor the notice of the beeping traffic is not good but this is what New York City is all about.On the whole we loved our stay here & would recommend as it is very central in time square.,"Macclesfield, United Kingdom","Kerry09052009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Macclesfield, United Kingdom</strong>",32,4.0

The hotel was easy to find and the reception area looks great - sleek and modern. They do not accept passports for check in, only accept credit cards. I was initially given a large king room facing the street on the second floor. On the first night, I found out why NYC is known at the city that never sleeps. Even as a deep sleeper, I had issues and when I called the front desk, they asked if I wanted earplugs. I opted for a room change which they dealt with quickly and I was in a new room the next day. This time I was on the 5th floor but still on the street which made no difference to the noise level. However, they could only offer me a smaller room away from the street which I declined.In a rush to get my stuff together to move from one room to another, I forgot to get my passport and some spare cash out of the safe and they brought the safe to me straight away. Nothing was missing.The bed is comfortable and the shower was amazing; good pressure. No chocolate mints on the pillow but something more useful in the form of a daily report detailing the weather for the next few days and places of where to go and where to eat.Pros:Amazing location; you are just off Times Square - it cannot get any betterFriendly staff, happy to help at all timesGorgeous styled room - different to all the boring chain hotels and definitely memorableHuge wet room and lovely toiletriesCons:The level of noise coming from the street is ridiculous - earplugs might be a necessity The rooms are dark and lack good lighting, however the bathroom does have good lightingNo full length mirror; Guys might not be so fussed about this but I like to see what I look like before I leave the houseThe lift takes ages to arrive; just use stairs if you can.Rooms are starting to look a little bit wornThe A/C makes a lot of noise when on, I would turn the A/C on when I left for the day and then turn it off once I got backI sadly didn't try the restaurant but it looked great.I purposely chose this hotel as I wanted something different in terms of style and look and this hotel delivered - if they sorted out the noise issues for the front rooms, it would be a 5 out of 5 review. However, despite this, I would choose this hotel again for their service standards alone.","London, United Kingdom","Little_Miss_Nishma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

The room comes complete with a flat screen with lots of channels and on-demand movies.

Staff are friendly and very helpful should you need any assistance. The attached bar has 'happy hour' specials each evening which is welcome after a long day on your feet. One evening we arrived to find that most of the bar had been booked out to a company so it was standing room only, however we were welcome to take our drinks to enjoy in our room as we got ready for the night ahead.

This being New York, opening the windows is not an option, and so we were stuck with this awful smell for a night. The front desk staff were rather terse and unhelpful. The restaurant/bar outside area was right below our room and the noise from revellers continued until around 2am.In the end we checked out after only one night and went to a more airy, spacious and bright hotel.

I can tell you that our stay at the Night Hotel contributed greatly to the experience. We were in a king sized room.An opinion of a hotel starts with the staff. They are the welcome wagon which can set the tone for your stay. These men and women at Night Hotel were great. Every one of them. I can’t remember the name of the young man who checked us in, but he was so sweet and very professional at every encounter. Patrick too is a real gem. He’s very personable and knows his city. They are all very knowledgeable about NYC and are happy to answer any and all questions. One night we had a lengthy and great conversation with one of their employees (again, I can’t remember his name! rats!) who grew up in Paris and Lisbon and spoke at least a handful of languages. He was so interesting. A++ for customer service.The room is quite small. Although it is a “typical size” for a NYC room, according to so many locals. It was clean. We quickly got used to the size because it was decorated so cool, and it quickly felt like we were staying in a room of a friend’s house. We appreciated the comfortable bed with its nice sheets which made for a good nights sleep. The cosy bathrobes were a welcome touch, and I was glad to know that they were a perk that comes with the room. We were on the 2nd floor and had a view of 45th St. My husband slept like a rock, and I felt that any street noise wasn’t too bad. I would bet that the windows are dual pane. I NEVER heard a peep from anyone above our room, nor did I hear ANY sound through the walls. That really made me happy, and I took notice of how thick the walls must be. They don’t make ‘em like that anymore. An “A-” for the room. They would get an “A” if there were a bathtub, but I learned that none of their rooms have a bathtub.LOVED the location. Enjoyed grabbing a drink at Connelly’s across the street (free wi-fi over there). Your choice of 3 Irish bars complete with munchies, and friendly employees are right across the street. Starbucks is a couple of doors towards TS, and heading towards 6th and across the street is a 24 hour deli. We split a nice little veggie sandwich there at about 3 am on the night we arrived before we hit the hay. A++ for location.Only a couple of blocks from our favorite hole-in-the-wall breakfast and/or lunch/early dinner place called, “Green Symphony” 255 W 43rd St - between 7th Ave & 8th Ave. This is a health food haven and “a must” if you are into SUPER fresh, SUPER tasty recipes at a great price. I'm definitely going to review them on TA.There is a sushi restaurant in the Night Hotel, but as vegetarians we never tried it.OK, that's about it. I will think back on this trip with fond memories, and they were a big part of it.","Palm Springs, CA","Pilates_Gal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Springs, CA</strong>",61,5.0

Furthermore despite how close it was to the center very little of the outside could be heard from the room.The room is very basic, it has a small bathroom, wardrobe and not large draws so don't expect to unpack. There are no coffee making facilities and its hit and miss as to what plug sockets work. This is to be as expected though due to the price and central location in New York. Just don't look of the pictures of the lobby and expect luxury it is a very basic hotel.The Air-Con is the loudest i have ever encountered and there was also a second couple complaining of this while we were checking out. There is also no free WiFi in the room which is disappointing.We stayed for 2 nights and the room was not cleaned in between each of our nights which meant we had to go to reception to request dry towels. Also, there was no duvet cover around the duvet, just loose sheets which caused me to be concerned about cleanliness. Finally the porter who stored our cases in between checking out and leaving New York seemed very keen for us to take the Hotel transfer from New York to JFK - going as far as miss-leading us about the cost of a New York cab (he told us they were $65 plus tolls- however they are $45 plus tolls)",Preston,"rush1981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston</strong>",6,2.0

If you want to be right on Times Square you couldn't get closer to the big lights n buzz etc but still far enough into 45th street not to be bothered by it all. Hotel was clean and quiet within (no noise from outside considering its close proximity to TS) Nice bottle of sparkling wine on arrival altough I guess most hotels do this. Reception staff were nice enough without being over bearing altough some people might want that extra attention....not me though!!Cons Price. £900/$1400ish for 5 nights. Most probably the going rate for TS but still a bit steep considering we only spent a few hours in it each night sleeping. $10 for 24hrs of WiFi. Maybe thats the going rate but still, little extras like that add up and leaves one slightly annoyed. Rooms were small with no bath however again seems to be the case for most hotels in TS. Traffic to the hotel from Newark Airport was horrendous. $85 to the hotel in a yellow cab but $100 from hotel in a limo. The hotel had a bar and restaurant however never seemed to be that busy. Hard sell considering the location but I suspect it needs to have one for other reasons rather than wants one. OverallDecent hotel and will suit most people but I won't be going back to a TS location. There are other areas outwith TS that are cheaper and really only a 5/10 minute walk away and don't forget NYC isn't just about TS which by the way is cool to look at but there is so much more going on elsewhere.

Our room wasn't quite ready yet, but the staff safely locked away our luggage and Patrick told us the best place to get some brunch in the meantime. He also gave us a map of Manhattan and gave us a few basic tips on how to navigate the city. Patrick also noticed that our birthdays were not too off from our stay and he sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room that night. SCORE! Overall, the concierge was incredible and very friendly. It felt like they instantly knew what kind of things would interest us and could direct there without any problems! We trusted them, and in turn had a great trip!Now the inside is absolutely GORGEOUS. It's a little risque, but for us early 20's girls it was just our speed. The black and white interior made for an elegant and modern feel and made us feel very classy, which we always like. HAH!Our room was the perfect size for two good friends who don't mind sharing a king sized bed. Not to mention, the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.The location could not have been better. It is literally a block from Times Square. My friend and I were able to walk pretty much everywhere from the hotel (except for the Statue of Liberty, duh), but we hardly spent any money on transportation which was a HUGE plus!Everyone on the staff, from room service to the front door, was so beyond friendly and welcoming.

But then couldn't fix it anyway. The wi-fi cost extra... which happens these days in some places but at NYC prices it seems a bit too much. There was valet service for the car... not on-premises parking. we were told to call 55 minutes ahead for it. We told them when we would be leaving when we went out to get breakfast and they agreed they would have it for us. That was the only thing that wasn't late.

This was a short trip so we decided to stay in the city and location was top priority. I looked at many hotels some double the price point of The Night. However, I don't think they would have given me double the service or value of this hotel. The risque photography and theme of the hotel would be discouraging for families with young children but this hotel was never intended for that sort of clientele. It is well done and doesn't come off as cheap or over the top. The staff is the gem of this hotel. They are very professional and personable which I feel is something that is overlooked. I've stayed in many nice places and the staff at the Night would rival any of them in staff. Patrick specifically was excellent in helping us find restaurants, make reservations & offer other helpful bits of advice. He made us feel as though we were staying at a friend's apartment in the city. His service was 90% of why I would highly recommend this hotel. Other staff were very accommodating as well and made our stay a great one. After reading some previous reviews from others I would like to put some of their negatives to rest. The rooms could be considered on the small side. However, this is NYC and everything is smaller. This room isn't any bigger than it needs to be. People complained about the lighting and needing to constantly use artificial lighting even during the day. However, you're not staying at a resort with an amazing vista. You're in NYC and your there to see the sights. You want day light? Go to the top of the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, or go for a walk in Central Park. You're in the city that never sleeps and that has an endless list of things to see and do. Use the room for what it's designed for, sleeping and taking a break from the city.","Gainesville, Florida","G9N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gainesville, Florida</strong>",23,5.0

I would like to thank the team at Night Hotel for attending to our requirements in a very hospitable and flexible manner. A few previous reviews left different reviews but , but as far as our stay was concerned, it was nearly perfect and I can't find any fault. Not only the front of house guest services agents we came across, but also back of the house staff members even the security person were all nice and friendly. In my opinion it is ultimately the people that make or break it, not the facilities. Staff / Customer Service We made 2 bookings via a travel agent, first for 2 nights and second one for 1 night. Prior to our departure from Sydney, we contacted the hotel via their facebook page to reconfirm our bookings, they reconfirmed them straight away. We did this because we normally book things by ourselves but for Night Hotel, we used a travel agent so we wanted to be sure. For our first stay however, we got stranded in San Francisco upon transiting because United cancelled our flight. As a result we were put up in a hotel by them in SFO Airport that night, which meant we could only arrive the following day at Night Hotel, i.e. our stay was to be shortened from 2 nights to 1 night. We contacted them via Facebook, no problem at all, they revised our booking and even told us they would not be charging us for the cancelled night (which we will tell our travel agent so they can refund us the money for the night). This all happened on the day of our original check-in date so I would have expected no-refund. So this was a very nice gesture by the hotel. Upon check-in, the receptionist was friendly and showed his empathy as to our inconvenience of having to change our booking plan at the last minute. He did mention the mini-bar was very sensitive and advised us to be careful, which we were. Room/Bar The room/decor etc are exactly what photos on this forum show, yes the room was small and there was virtually no significant view from the window. But it is New York and we didn't choose this hotel for the size of the room or view through the window. The cleanliness was perfect (which is important to us), we were given free WiFi and the connection was pretty good. If for whatever reason, you aren't given free WiFi and you don't want to pay for it, there's a Starbucks literally 1 minute walk from the hotel's entrance.The bathroom was spacious enough, with more than adequate amenities and a good strong shower. The air-con unit is ""not quiet"" but we didn't care. It was not ""noisy"" and it worked fine. We appreciated the cool breeze coming out of it. We used the lobby bar one night and enjoyed a few cocktails. The staff members were again friendly and made sure everything was good for us. Our rooms were on the mid-level (level 3 and 4 I think), so we mainly took the stairs next to the lift to get to/from our rooms. But the lift was fast too, we just didn't mind walking up and down the stairs.In between our two staysWe asked the hotel to hold one of our bags between our two stays (there was a 3 night gap in between). They were more than happy to have our bag stored with no charge! Check-out On the day of departure (of our 2nd and final stay), check-out was smooth and the receptionist was informative and helpful. We had to go to Grand Central Station and we were initially thinking of taking a cab but the receptionist assured us that even with our bags it would be very close and easy to get to. He also showed us exactly which street/avenue to take. LocationAs almost all reviews have written, if your priority is to stay close to/within Times Square district at a quite reasonable (by NYC standard) price, I would happily recommend Night Hotel. It is on 45th Street, close to all the theatres (such as Lion King, that's on the same street), Times Square, Forever 21 (shopping!) etc. Overall, as mentioned we enjoyed our stay and would definitely look to Night Hotel for our next visit to New York.","Sydney, Australia","JimmySydney01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",83,4.0

Overall I was quite disappointed with the so called ""urban Gothic aesthetic"" of the Night Hotel. The entire place was overwhelmingly dark. My room, which was very small even by NYC standards, was entirely devoid of any color - everything was either black or white, including the bathroom which contained a black tiled shower stall and black shower curtain. The lighting system in the room was extremely poor, and when coupled with the absence of any natural light (the room had two small windows facing another building) produced a dark and oppressive feeling. Those who crave (or need) light, or who are claustrophobic should stay elsewhere.Other cons: 1) The air conditioner was extremely noisy, which effectively prevented me from getting a decent night's sleep. I can honestly say that it was one of the loudest hotel air conditioner units that I have encountered in recent memory. The level of noise produced was simply unacceptable, and this issue alone would keep me from returning to this hotel.2) The room was not exactly in tip top shape. The walls were scuffed, electrical sockets were loose in the walls, and the black shower was in need of renovating. 3) There was no in-room safe.4) The television did not function properly, with channels periodically freezing or losing reception.5) A password is required to use the WiFi (hardly noteworthy), but oddly this was not provided during check-in. I had to call down to reception to request a password for my mobile phone, and then call down a second time to get another password for my laptop. On the positive side, the location of the hotel is excellent for access to Time's Square. The bottom line: unless you have an overwhelming urge to experience the Gothic décor, and are willing to accept small, dark and noisy quarters, consider one of the many better hotels in the area.","Ontario, Canada","RiobardA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>",31,2.0

However, we thoroughly enjoyed our stayed at this hotel and found the staff welcoming, helpful and most accommodating. The location is superb - and for the price we paid we feel that we would struggle to get better value in NYC. We would stay here again without hesitation in spite of a few minor negatives which are as as much to do with us as anything. Our room was small but that was not a problem and other reviewers had pointed that out before. The rooms were also dark and although this was generally not a problem, it could prove difficult to read things or find things that had dropped on the floor and with a dodgy light switch as well it was even more difficult. As I said, as much to do with our ailing eyesight (and carelessness in dropping things in the first place) as anything else! We were also a little disappointed that internet access was an extra cost as most of our daily planning of what to do was researched while there and maps etc. were downloaded to iphones to take with us. This is one area where it seems the UK is ahead of the US in that hotels are happy to give complimentary internet access (almost an expectation now) although we noticed that even the airport lounges in USA tend not to have complimentary access either.Nonetheless this does not detract from what was an excellent experience and one we would happily repeat despite the little moan (rating reflecting this)! Congratulations to managers and staff - you made the experience verty enjoyable for these first-time visitors to the Big Apple.

Very close to Times Square, Broadway, 5th Ave, and Central Park. Upon arriving to the hotel, my wife was so enthused about the decor of the hotel because it is hip, unique, and swank. The downside of the decor is the dark is never inviting; after a bright day in central park and walking around, the last thing we wanted to come back to was a dark hotel (saying this in comparision with the other hotels we stayed at during the trip). The rooms are small but that was not too much of an issue as we knew what to expect from reading the reviews. At the beginning of our stay, we were put in a room that was along 45th street and even a few stories up, road noise was heard at all hours of the day. We asked for another room but due to the prior reservations, we could not be accomodated until the last night, which greatly improved the noise. The bed quality is less than average (comparing to the other hotels we were in). The mattress is fair at best with a down comforter and the pillows do not hold their shape after a few mintues.One note about our room change - the room we moved to on the back side had mold on the roof of the bathroom and needs repair.Overall, this hotel is ideal for a one night stay and someone who will benefit from the location (although there are too many hotels in the area).","St. Augustine, Florida","diguan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Augustine, Florida</strong>",73,2.0

Yes, it was more expensive than hailing a cab but we were leaving during rush hour and I just didn’t want the uncertainty of being able to find one.I would definitely stay there again.Minus points?

From the horse hide couch in the lobby, to the entire black & white decor, to the faint purple lighting under beds, it just doesn't get any cooler. The room was small-ish but from what I hear this is typical of New York and, in fact, apparently these are actually larger than most rooms in New York. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the tv had about a million channels! The restaurant isn't open for breakfast but no matter as there is a Starbucks two doors down. The location can't be beat - 1/2 a block from the center of Times Square! Central to everything else as well. We walked north to Central Park, south to Madison Square Gardens, east to the shore of the East River and west to the Hudson River. The few landmarks you can't walk to are accessible by the many bus tours available or the subway, either of which you can find within blocks of the hotel.  The staff was also great. The front desk girl (who's name we didn't get, sorry!) went out of her way to help us locate a White Castle :) and the door man, Simon, couldn't have been friendlier.  We did request a view of the street, which we got, and we did find it a bit noisy due to traffic and the construction across the street (which starts early even on Saturday & Sunday) but we are city people so it didn't really bother us. Can't comment on the wifi as we didn't use it because we are cheap and didn't want to pay the $10 for it. :)  Would absolutely, positively stay here again without having to think about it for even a second.",toronto,"jacqlynnToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>toronto</strong>",51,5.0

I confess to being a little uncertain as to what to expect when I checked out the hotel's website - voted the sexiest hotel in NYC, and with lots of very ""sexy-looking"" people all over the place - but I needn't have worried.The hotel is a small, boutique hotel over nine floors. The rooms are very small but function well and the bathrooms are fine. The decor is what hits you - very dark, a bit goth - and I did wonder if the constant theme of black was covering up something. But once I got over the unusual look I found it to be a normal tourist hotel which suited my needs well.The hotel's biggest plus is its location. About 100 metres east of Times Square on W45 St is about as central as you can get in NYC, and this worked well as a base for the things I had planned.The hotel staff were all friendly, helpful and courteous. I didn't use the hotel's bar or room service faciloities, but there were plenty of places around to have meals. Un Deux Trois, a restuarant on the same block, around the corner in W44 St, does a great breakfast from 7 am. I went there twice. O'Lunney's pub directly opposite the hotel did great meals in a sort of pub style, which was fine for me.The wifi wasn't free (unlike the European hotels I've stayed in on this trip) but at $10 a day it was a lot cheaper than hotels in Australia and New Zealand. This $10 covered both my devices, too (phone and laptop). You just need to get a new username and password when the 24 hours on your old ones have expired.Noise is always an issue in NYC but I found the room was comfortable at night with the windows closed, especially as the weather was mild. The air conditioning was very noisy in the room but I didn't need it when I was sleeping. I was on the 8th floor so it might have been noisier lower down.All up I have no real complaints and would stay there agin.","Adelaide, Australia","Graham A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",54,4.0

Given that this hotel is a stones throw from Times Square the lack of outside noise was amazing! Bathroom had a shower, no tub. We did have to get them to send up wash clothes as there was only one in the unit. For ice you need to call the front desk as there are no ice machines available. The room came with a stocked mini-refrigerator (water, drinks, snacks) but we did not use it. Read their information at checkin as it does say that they can assess your $30.00 if you put your own items in the refrigerator. Can not comment on the restaurant as we did not use it.

When I arrived at the hotel, the staff at the front desk were not particularly friendly and did not make an effort to check if I could get a room earlier - which is a travelers worst nightmare after having traveled for approx 23 hrs. I had to hang around for about 4 hours for a room. I told the staff to then call me when my room was ready as I was just going to wait in the restaurant til the room was ready. I ended up spending some time in the restaurant which I have to say was wonderful. The restaurants host and his staff were lovely and a pleasant surprise from the staff at the front desk to the hotel. Staff at reception never bothered to call me to tell me when my room was ready - I had to approach them several times to see whether the room was ready.The room was lovely and the bed super comfortable-the decor and the bedding were the best things about this hotel as it has a very unique feel.

Good restaurant (VERY low lighting) in the hotel and a well-known and high-end steak house with outdoor seating area next door. The housekeeping, front-desk, and front staff were pleasant and tried to be helpful. LACKING: (was only there for two nights, so this may not be the 'norm'): Doorman or anyone to help bring my bags in from the car upon arrival. I booked the reservation via a hotel booking website, and was told upon arrival that there was an issue with my booking. The bottom line: After showing the manager several confirmations including one from the Night Hotel itself, both the reservation and rate were honored. Room: Clean overall. However, the room smelled strongly of smoke-the hotel staff offered to move me, but not until the next day as they were sold out. The window frame was broken (bolt missing). The linens clean overall, but a plastic duvet cover between duvet and sheets would help. No In-Room Safe, No on-site Fitness Center, and No Free WiFi--the internet service was barely existent (so slow that dial-up would have seemed fast. The front desk said ""definitely being worked on"" but were still going to charge $10.00 per day for the service! When I complained, they ultimately did not charge). Sexiest Hotel?

The rooms are dark and quiet, and the first time we stayed here (apex 2 years ago) my boyfriend said he got the best nights sleep ever. Check-in was smooth, the man that helped us let us know that wi-fi is not free, but if you sign up for their rewards program, then it is complimentary. It was a no-brainer. The decor is very sexy, black and white wall coverings, linens and photography. The room was very tidy, the bf dropped a vitamin, we were on our hands and knees looking for it, so we did a much more thorough check of the floors than we would normally do and we were pleasantly surprised. New York rooms and bathrooms are small, but Night does a good job of fitting in everything that you need without it feeling cramped.The only reason it is a 4 rather than a 5 is there is no breakfast room service.

Tried Red Moon, and liked their food. Affordable but not budget. A shoutout to the great people that holds the place together: Barry, Simon, Patrick and Mimi.

It was located literally a half a block away from Times Square, the hotel is gothic, sensual and swanky, the color theme is perfect, white, grey and black. My hotel room was small but it had everything you needed, there was a window but no view since the hotel is located between two buildings. The bed was amazing! I've never slept in anything so comfortable, the housekeeper was so sweet. Every day someone came and left a sheet of paper with the weather and several chocolates, the front desk was very friendly as was the door man. I arrived about 3 hours early from my check in time, they stowed away my luggage and told me they would call me if my room becomes ready prior to 3. I went and walked around Times Square, got some coffee then returned around 2 and they had my room ready! I thought it was great how they kept my luggage for me so I didn't have to lug it around on the streets :) needless to say, the night hotel will definitely be my go-to place next time I visit NYC. Also I booked my stay through the actual hotel website and not a third party website and I actually paid less than what the other sites were offering!!! They were having a special during the time I booked the hotel that if you stayed more than 3 nights it was 30% off, so my 4 night stay came out to $650 dollars!

The stellar reviews drew me to the Night after looking at several lower priced places that had rather mixed receptions. Arriving in the morning to store my baggage before our room was ready I could not have felt more welcome and knew I'd made the right choice. I was granted immediate access to the free Wi-Fi I had been given as part of my booking and was offered lots of help from the lovely staff at reception. Although the Wi-Fi connection did not prove as strong in our seventh floor room, that was the only small issue I had with our stay.Depending on your own experience of hotels you might find the Queen sized room small, but it was perfect for our three night stay. The bed was robust and wonderfully comfortable, and all the provisions in the room were suitably up to standard and fitted well with the sharp black and white colour scheme that runs throughout the hotel. The bathroom facilities were great and although the TV didn't have the best reception on all channels, it didn't matter as very little of our time was taken up by channel surfing. The ability to order up local food from diners and restaurants in Times Square to our room provided us with some delightful indulgences - as did the delicious chocolate brought to us for free shortly after we checked into the room! The accompanying letter from the general manager welcoming us to the hotel was also a nice touch.Returning to our beautifully remade room after days spent exploring the city was always a pleasure, and I do not believe much more could have been done to improve our stay. We didn't find time to sample the attached Red Moon restaurant's fusion cuisine, but the menu looked like one we should definitely try next time.

The beds were by far the best sleep i have ever had. Me and my girlfriend were looking for an affordable luxury in the heart of New York and that's exactly what we got. The night was voted New yorks sexiest hotel and you can certainly see why. Although the rooms are a little small and dark they do exactly what they need to. The sleep is amazing and it's got a beautiful sexy decor. I had no issue with noise, dirt or quality. The staff at the Night hotel are amazing especially Patrick and the doorman they are extremely helpful. This was my first time in New York and Patrick took a good 30 mins out of his day to mark me up a map and tell me all the best spots for what I wanted. Although its not a sky scraper and doesn't have any bath tubs the night is amazing. You can step out of the front door and your in the centre of time square. This being the case there was unusually no noise in our room. Not from the streets or the other guests which was very relaxing. Also another nice touch is every time you return to your room after its been cleaned there is classical music on the radio, which made the whole experience even more relaxing. If it is your first time in New York this is a good location. The great thing about time square is you are very central to manhattan and can catch any train you need. The time square train station has almost every line stop and there are alot of lines. We both bought a $29 train card for a week which made exploring New York simple quick and easy. Unless you are going to fork out a stupid amount of money for 5 star luxury, go to the night hotel. You will leave feeling happy it is a little dark but bedrooms are for sleeping.

Hotel was booked for me and I'm not sure I'd have chosen it from the photos online! As others have said, the decor is bold and brave. Maybe a bit too brave - I'm told a certain photo is being moved from the lobby to a darker corner!I also visited the sister hotel, currently called Stay, but to be rebranded Night Hotel New York ( and this one becomes Night Hotel Times Square). It too has bold design but is much brighter and colourful.What made this hotel special for me were the staff. The front desk were massively helpful, especially Patrick and Daniela. And also Simon on the door. The house keeping staff would chat and give tourist tips.Minor niggles - the lighting is too poor with the black decor. Now and again you need brighter lighting. I had a lot of black clothes in a black lined case. I dropped something on the floor in the lobby seating area and needed a torch to find it! But the low-level lighting in the bedrooms is genius and so relaxing.And I think the service elevator was out on some days, with housekeeping stopping the lift at every floor leaving guests waiting.But the big question is would I go back and I have to say yes.

It is a great location right in Times Square and pretty reasonably priced. Very comfy bed and great shower (definitely a plus considering how cold NYC was!).Staff were pleasant although were not very helpful with some basic concierge services (not through lack of trying though).I did feel that the hotel was trying to rip you off a bit though. Firstly, they take a $50 deposit for each day you are there which is then refunded upon your checkout (this did not happen at any of the two other NYC hotels we stayed at). They also automatically charge you for any thing that is removed from the fridge even if you don't consume it (based on weight I believe). If you decide to put personal things in the fridge, you may be charged a $30 restocking fee, even if you don't move anything. Internet is $10 per 24 hours and they did not explain that it is per device logged on not per room so if you log on using three devices, you will be charged three times. We only knew this because another patron told us in the lift after she had seen us ask for the log in details. Unlike our other hotels, you are also charged for local calls (not that this is a big deal).On a side note, this may not be suitable for families. There are some very provocative photos in public areas of the hotel. Housekeeping staff were very pleasant during our stay. My fiancée was sick in bed so we had the do not disturb on. On our second day, housekeeping called to check that we didn't need anything and once they found out he was sick, would call each day and ask how he was feeling.","Brisbane, Australia","AleceD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

Firstly the location is ideal for those visiting NYC. It was our first time in NYC, and we couldn't have asked for a better location (literally seconds from Time Square). Don't be put off by the proximity to Time Square, the Hotel is actually very quiet and chilled (a welcome break from the carnage that is Time Square!).There are a number of subway stations nearby (about 4 blocks away), so it is fairly easy to get to, and to visit the many sites of Manhatten. Furthermore, we felt safe walking to here at anytime day or night.The decor of the hotel is fairly funky (possibly not to everyones taste), but we really liked it (black and white everywhere including the bathroom). The room was a good size with a large bathroom (for NY), and a separate wardrobe, it was perfect for the week we stayed there. We weren't wanting for anything, and as others have said the beds are very comfortable (just what you need after a long day walking the sites).The two negatives I would have are that the doors to the bedrooms are very light and can occasionally rattle (only a problem if you are a very light sleeper).Secondly the cost of drinks in the bar are fairly expensive (mind you everything around Time Square is expensive),All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel, particularly for couples.","Cork, Ireland","dr_duddle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cork, Ireland</strong>",36,5.0

I certainly appreciated the black and white trendy decoration perfectly illustrated by various contributor's pictures. The staff is very welcoming and that worked for me from arrival to departure. Now as i often do i will list what i liked and did not like so much. On the bright side: the decoration did it for me, It is rather dark but modern and i like dark as it feels cosy. The bedding is very good. Going to bed feels like diving in a cotton ball (maybe a bit too soft for who likes hard bedding). Very clean overall. Wifi is not too expensive ($10/day). Smokers will appreciate the patio - so much nicer than the sidewalk to indulge! Bathrobe in room, ok amenities. Many will appreciate the bar on premises. Minibar in room well filled ($5 for softdrinks if i remember well). Large flat screen and selection of cable channels (a bit of a pain that many of chargeable and not flagged as such : you keep browsing. But TV is not the purpose of a visit to NY ! ) . There are a few things that came short for me. The room was very small. A medium size luggage hardly fit in it. The closet is small and hosts the fridge, there were no drawers and i could not unpack. The door to the corridor could provide better shiedling from corridor noises. I could hear my neighbors come and go as if they were in my room. Otherwise rooms to the back of the hotel are quiet (no traffic noise - beware of construction works across the street these days though. They run thru the night on week-ends - typical of NY ;-). The water in bathroom has regularly been more warm than hot. I seriously lacked power plugs by bedside. And finally two things i found rather not welcoming : there is a charge of $30 per stay if you use the fridge for your own items, and no coffee machine in room, even on demand (first time for me in years of travelling to NY...). The hotel has 8 floors+penthouse. Do not expect a view, And target a high floor for some 'space outside your window'.But do not let all that turn you down , I list to inform fellow travellers in case any of these really matter to you when making a choice.

Fantastic location for all tourist attractions, just 1 minute off Times Square, a few blocks from Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Port Authority (for Woodbusy Common trips!) The hotel looks exactly as it does in the photos, the room you see is the room you get and it really is lovely. On our first evening, a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room, compliments of the staff, which was a really lovely gesture. Our room was a standard room, and because of the reviews I had read here, I was expecting it to be tiny, but it really wasn't all that bad. We could store our suitcases (&shopping bags!) in the closest space & there was more than enough room. Our room was kept clean for the week & it really was lovely. One thing I would suggest when booking with this hotel, ask for a room high up, or at the back of the hotel. We were on the second floor facing the street, and from 7am each morning, the drilling started right across the road, and the windows are thin enough that it was as though you were out on the street with the builders. So sleep quality was 0 after 7 a.m. The other thing is, get a phone card if you intend on using the hotel phone. My partner used the phone in our room to phone relations in New Jersey & to phone home, using the phone for a total of 13 minutes over the week & this cost $77! When I was paying the bill on checkout, I was told that a calling card could have been purchased at the start of our stay which would have been a fraction of the cost. Also, where the closest space is is very dark. I understand that the hotel theme is dark & I loved that, but there was no lighting at all in that part of the room & at times I felt like I was doing a lucky dip when looking for clothes in the morning!!

I'm 5'2'' and petite - I had to turn sideways to wiggle through the space between the bed and the desk to get to the bathroom. I'm not complaining, but be aware that if you are larger you should request a more spacious room. My husband ordered room service while I was attending a meeting and said the food was excellent. My only complaint is that we had a non-smoking room and when we woke up the morning the room reeked of cigarette smoke. We had initially planned for a leisurely morning in NYC but the smell was so bad we just packed and caught an early train. I mentioned it to the front desk and they said it might have had something to do with the ventilation system. My husband and I both have allergies that are greatly irritated by cigarette smoke, so that aspect was very disappointing.

I arrived in NYC on November 19 and stayed though November 23. The moment I stepped into this hotel I fell in LOVE! First, the pictures you see of this hotel are EXACTLY the way this hotel looks from the lobby to the room. The front desk was superior and professional! Barry was professional and very helpful. We arrived early and Barry even stored our bags so we could hit the town! The front desk kept me VERY informed on the room and was very prompt on getting us checked in! I can't say enough about the girls that night! Barry and the girls were funny and always polite! When we got to our room we did not have to worry about our bags, they we brought up by Barry. The rooms were AMAZING! I'm sorry AMAZING! Lol! They look EXACTLY like the pictures! The beds were VERY clean and AMAZINGLY comfortable! The black & white decor and gothic look was so cool and elegant at the time. The rooms were set up nice and had a lot of personal touches like a menu for room service and a five day forecast. The papers were topped with little chocolates! The bathrooms are GREAT TOO! I loved the big shower heads and the personal touches that were also in the bathroom. There were extra towels and even a little needle and thread kit! So NICE!!! There is a mini fridge in the room. The snacks and drinks are expensive but, worth it when you’re tired and don't what to leave the room! LOL! I did not eat in the restaurant but, the food looked AMAZING by the menu. The t.v. is mounted on the wall and there is new desk with everything you need! Housekeeping was very nice and helpful! Always asking if you need anything or any fresh towels. The concierge service was great! They were very helpful with anything I needed or anything I was needed to get done. The gentlemen at front were always there to open the doors and greet you EVERYTIME you came and left. Barry, Simon, and the third gentleman (I'm sorry I never got his name) were always helpful and professional. The front desk and door men always greeted you upon arriving and leaving. This was a SUPERIOR hotel to stay. They really set the bar high for other hotels in NYC. I will not stay at any other hotel in NYC BUT, THE NIGHT HOTEL! This hotel left a HUGE IMPRESSION on not only me but, my 11 year old daughter too! I would recommend this hotel to EVERYONE! I LOVE this hotel! I have stayed at a lot of hotels in NYC and by far THIS hotel SUPERIOR! I give these hotel 20 STARS! Thank you for making my stay so amazing while in NYC and I will definitely, be back to this hotel next year!","Clearwater, Florida","EZulker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clearwater, Florida</strong>",2,5.0

The Small Double Rooms #62, #52, etc, have a somewhat noisy A/c unit outside, but the comfortable bed overcame the noise! The room was small, although no smaller than hotel rooms in England or France -- so if you're used to this, it's OK. There was closet/hanging space, but no shelf space.

When I'm in New York City, I tend to stick with chain hotels as there are certain comforts that I rely on at the end of a busy day and boutique hotels do not always offer these comforts.I was so surprised to find a unique, comfortable and affordable hotel that also offered creature comforts that are usually only found in larger, more traditional hotels! Check-in at The Night Hotel was professional and quick. There was an interesting ambience in the lobby with quiet activity and hospitality. I was offered assistance to get my bags to my room and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean, fresh and welcoming the decor appeared. The room design is striking (the headboard of the bed is quite a design statement), the linens and bed is very comfortable and the bathroom offers all the amenities (shampoo, conditioner, soaps, hair dryer, sewing kit). There was a closet with a safe, an umbrella and full length bathrobes. In addition, the room offered a small refrigerator and everything needed to open a bottle of wine or mix a cocktail (no plastic glasses).Though I rarely watch television, the wall mounted television was high definition, there were movies and plenty of channels, I could borrow movies and games from the lobby (if I desired) or chose a movie to be billed to my room. There was a desk, plenty of outlets and plenty of comfortable pillows. And did I mention the Bose Wave sound system? It was so nice to come back to the room at the end of the day to quietly playing classical music, low lighting and the bathrobe waiting on the bed.Every employee - and I mean everyone - was professional, attentive and helpful. I felt completely safe and though I stayed on the second floor, I had no issues with noise. In fact, I fell into bed each night and felt completely ""cocooned""...some of the best night's of sleep I have had in a hotel.The Night is mere steps from Times Square and smack in the middle of the theater district - a welcome proximity as as woman walking back to the hotel alone after a broadway show. There were restaurants and activities of every price point nearby and yet, when you walked into the hotel, there was a pervasive sense of calm that told you that you ""were home""....at least for a little while.The Night hotel is in a great destination spot, but the hotel itself is worthy of a visit just to enjoy being pampered a bit. The combination is unbeatable. My son goes to college in New York City and I visit frequently.

No mirror apart from the bathroom one is a bit of an inconvenience. I understand the point of the decor and lighting is to create a 'night' atmosphere, however, this is utterly pointless when the lights from the TV receiver and the alarm clock radio need to be plugged out because they are so bright! Also, if you're a light sleeper, don't expect to be able to have the air conditioning turned on at night. It's about as loud as a car engine (seriously...).Rooms are clean, although housekeeping missed our room on the first night due to our 'do not disturb' button having been pressed before we arrived - we never saw/knew about this until told. Maybe a mention upon check-in might be a good idea?Our hot water was unavailable for the main part of a day which was quite inconvenient. For the inconvenience, management gave us 2 free cocktail vouchers for the bar.Wifi was 10 euro per day (didn't use it - there's a starbucks right next door with free wifi - why bother paying?). Should really be free of charge, considering this is the norm nowadays. Note - was also charged for wifi on nights I didnt use it. Careful to check your bill!Had a major problem with one of the concierge staff. The main concierge was extremely nice and helpful throughout, but there was a younger concierge who seemed to work later shifts that was extremely unhelpful. When asked about travel arrangements to airports, he told us simply that there was no other option other than hiring a car/driver. Upon further investigation, I found both shuttle, train and taxi were all cheaper and more convenient options - makes me think that perhaps he was on commission with the car service. Watch out for this and make sure to research your travel options. Airtrain to both newark (from Penn station, which is only a few blocks away) and JFK are easy, taxi to LaGuardia is also reasonable.Overall a good hotel, but little things add up to make it less than perfect.

The hotel, is also far enough away from Times Square that you don't get all of the noise, which made sleeping very good.We were accomodated with a later check-out (1PM) which was great considering the partying that we did the night before.The Staff did their best to make your stay comfortable, they were very polite and very helpful with travelers' needs.On the negative side, there were a few things that we found odd.1) the internet service was down which was a little disappointing, however at $10/24hour period the cost would have been reasonable.2) The modern design of the hotel made for furniture that was a little lacking in what one would expect in the penthouse suite. The layout of the room was also a little odd, not to mention the big red exit sign on the upper level of the room....I understand that this is a necessity since it is the only space on that floor of the hotel....it was just a little odd to have that in your room.The balconies however made up for any inconviniences of the room!!!3) There was no in-room safe, but I when i mentioned this to the front staff they seemed a little surprised....I assume there once was a safe but when the re-did the room, the safe did not find it's way back....that should be an easy fix.Overall this was a great hotel in a fantastic location close to everything. We would definitely stay there again and would definitely recommend it to couples who are looking for more than the ordinary room.This is certainly not an ordinary hotel, it is small but more personable from many of the hotels that we have stayed at in NYC and the design of the hotel will really blow you away if you are looking for a sexy gettaway!","Montreal, Canada","rftomie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",24,4.0

I choose the Night Hotel because it sounded exactly what I was looking for and I got it at a great price on Hotels.com. We both liked the look of it on the web site and it turned out to be every thing they said it was. The decor was all black with over sized photographs of models every where, very stylish, all the staff we met were very friendly and helpful and there was always some one on duty at the front desk any time we went. The room was small but all the hotels in that area have small rooms so that was to be expected. The room was cleaned daily and had a turn down service every night with chocolate left on the pillow and even though we were only steps away from Times Square the room was quite and comfortable, we both slept very well every night. The bath room was very clean, shower toilet and wash basin however no bath tub, the toiletries were replaced every day. We had a bath robe for our use while staying in the hotel there was only one bath robe so we ask for a second and it arrived in minutes. They have free Wi-Fi in the lobby and they let us use their lap tops as we did not bring any so we were able to check email and print out boarding passes, we both were able to borrow lap tops at the same time so no waiting around. They left a thank you for using the hotel letter for each of us in our room with vouchers for complementary cocktails in the bar on the main floor that was a nice touch, the bar doubled as a restaurant also with black decor and friendly staff. The hotel has a great location just go out the front entrance and turn left take a few hundred steps and you are in Times Square, look to the left or take another few hundred steps and that’s where the ball drops on New Years Eve. The half price ticket booth for all the Broadway shows is also very close, right beside the bus stop for the hop on/off tour bus and the underground and the Broadway Dance Center for drop in dance classes was on the same street to the left of the hotel on the same side of the road about a four minute walk away.

There are so many choices but once I stumbled upon the Night Hotel, I knew I had found the perfect place. 1/2 a block from Times Square, it was surprisingly quiet and intimate even on the 2nd floor. The beds and pillows were comfortable and room service was very quick.The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the ambiance was perfect for a romantic getaway despite it being smack in the middle of the busiest tourist center in the U.S. The decor is dark and sultry, but not over the top. The lighting in the rooms were adequate, though it was a little difficult to see what you were doing in the closet without repositioning some of the adjustable lights. The queen room was tiny by normal standards, but not smaller than expected for a NY room. There are no dressers, but there is plenty of space below the built-in desk, the in the ottoman, on the deep window sill and in the closet to accommodate us on our three night stay with at least two outfits per day and 6 pairs of shoes.I've read reviews from some that were turned off by the erotic nature of the photos on the walls. They really aren't that racy at all and fit the decor quite well. If you're worried about your child seeing a boobie, you might not want to be staying in this part of town anyway. I wouldn't recommend the Night for people traveling with children; not because of the artwork, but the vibe is more suited for couples and I wouldn't want to impose on the other patrons.Great hotel, great location, great staff, and great price.

The location was perfect for us! Literally just off Times Square - good for playing tourist and super easy to find. We arrived way before check in time just to drop off our stuff, and found some polite and friendly staff - Patrick in particular. We were told that if our room was ready early they'd give us a call and we could get in early. And we did get that call around 1.30pm! I can't think of any other time where I've gotten into a hotel room early. Absolutely loved the room. Very nicely decorated, very clean and actually larger than I was expecting for a room in NYC. Although if we had been staying longer, the lack of drawers would have been a problem. The bed was very comfy, but was all feathers and annoyingly I'm allergic. However, we phoned down to reception and someone came straight up with different bedding. The only slight downers were no free wifi, the minibar has weight sensors we weren't informed of (so minor panic at check-out when we thought we were going to be charged for being nosy at the contents!), toiletries weren't the brand advertised and no coffee in rooms. There's construction going on across the street, but we heard nothing. We actually had a really good sleep thanks to the sound proofing and black out curtains! Also, loved the little touches - like the Karma Sutra (instead of a Bible!), the door bells and the umbrella. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and wished we'd stayed a little longer.

What can i say, this place is pure fire! Not only were the staff attentive and lovely, but the door man was as cute as they come! The room was TINY! But what can you expect for NYC! Lets just say that it was 'very cozy' Decor is dark. From the wallpaper, to the carpet, it is all very goth-chic. The room also comes with a bible in one drawer, and the karma sutra in another. hehe. Ive stayed at alot of hotels in my time and i have to honestly say that the bed in this room was the most COMFORTABLE beds i have slept in,. EVER! The location is a 2 minute walk to Times Square, and right next to a Starbucks for when you need to *ahem* steal WIFI and grab a coffee.If you dont get a deal online, the hotel can be a little costly. So make sure you scout around to find the best deal! We got the room for $2k for 8 nights. Quite reasonable for a boutique hotel in NYC. Only thing that i didnt like about the hotel was that the Wifi wasn't free. Ive taken off a full star for it. This boutique hotel is an awesome alternative to the big chain characterless hotels.

Location is the best! If you're looking for something near Times Square or Broadway, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better hotel, especially for the cost. Other positives include clean rooms and a nice decor. Other reviews here talk about the positives, and I agree with most of them. As for the not-so-good, there are a few things worth noting for me:First off, two days before our arrival, I emailed the hotel using their website form. I had questions about parking options and was hoping to get answers before driving into the City. Alas, here we're are on the day of checkout and still no response. I would recommend not using their on-line email to communicate with the hotel, as it appears no one checks it. For anyone curious about parking, the hotel offers valet parking for fifty-five per night. There might be lower cost options, but the hotel never responded, so unsure. Secondly, are the rooms. While nicely appointed they are very small, which is to be expected of rooms in NYC at this price range. What wasn't expected was the shower that took five minutes to adjust and the terrible squeak in the floor every time we walked on it. It was obviously caused by loose floor boards. We notified the staff of the noise upon check-out. They thanked us and said they would resolve the problem right away. If you get room fifty-four and the squeak is still there, you'll know they didn't correct it. Lol! The last item is a pet peeve of mine, and I always take away a full star for it. It's the lack of free wi-fi for guests. They charge ten per night, per device, which is crazy to me. For the rate of the room, free wi-fi should be included. If you have to increase the cost up front, fine. Just include wifi. if wifi had been included, this would have been a 4.5 rating, rounded up to five.There you have it. The location and price make up for the squeaks, shower, and lack of communication. If not for those, this would have been a three-star review. As it is, I rate this hotel as 3.5, and would stay here again without reservation.","Boise, Idaho","SteveHawk82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boise, Idaho</strong>",43,4.0

We came in February 2012 for Valentines and it was perfect!Patrick was fantastic and sets a high standard which I think some of the other members of staff should follow as their attitude and willingness to help seemed below standard. Patrick on the other hand was helpful, chatty, friendly and couldn't do enough for us! Such a pleasure. Also the two door men where very friendly and chatty and it seemed very genuine, not like they were hinting for a tip. The three girls in the bar where fabulous too and such a great laugh to chat too at the bar! Two of the girls were called Angelique & Jess and I cant remember the other girls name. It was her first shift and she seem nervous but was very nice too. I would like to say a big and special THANK YOU to the housekeeper that decorated our room with rose petals and the gifts I had bought for my fiance on Valentines Day. If meant so much that they took the time out to do that. The night hotel is a fantastic location for Broadway and Times Square. When you come out of the hotel and turn left, you're less than a minutes walk away! When your in the hotel you hear sirens and what not (as you would expect) but none of the hustle and bustle of the street. There is a great cafe over the road which is yummy and perfect for breakfast if you dont want to be ripped of for being a tourist. About a 5min walk from the hotel is an Irish bar called the playwright...highly recommended too! The meals where just huge! You get what you pay for. Oh, also, the subways are REALLY easy to get the hang of and Patrick very kindly explained to us there is an unlimited weekly pass you can get for around $30. It is most certainly the cheapest and easiest way to get round new york and it also means you can do more than just visit times square!I cant talk about this hotel, its staff, and its location enough. If your looking for somewhere for a romantic getaway where the interior is a bit sexy and boudoirish then this is the place to go. It has very seductive decor and is perfect for any couple.One minor down point, make sure you check about paying deposits on your arrival as taking a $50 refundable deposit per night on arrival was quite a shock as we weren't informed before hand.Hope Jess had a great time in the UK and we'll look forward to coming back to the Night Hotel in the future!

The location could not be beat if you need to be near Times Square and my rate was pretty incredible; it ended up being less than staying at a Best Western a few blocks away.The rooms were clean and had nice toiletries. The lobby was interesting and had a cool vibe. (Probably not a good family location as most of the art is on the adult side). The only thing that was not good was that the morning I checked in, I found the hotel online for a lower rate and the hotel was unwilling to honor the lower rate that I found. Additionally, I asked to be upgraded from a double to a queen and they charged me an additional $20/night. Not a huge deal but you would think that those two things together they would have compromised and said, ""We can't honor the new rate but we can offer you a complimentary upgrade.""

To my surprise Night only has 1 bed rooms bo roll aways or sofas available Either Needless to say I was stuck with the room and planned on having my son sleep on the floor. My check in went smoothly. Our room wasn't ready but to my surprise, Diane offered to take my cell number and call me when it was ready. I also inquired about my room size and Diane told me that I can be moved the next day to a larger room that may be more comfortable for our situation. we ventured out and took in some sights and an hour later Diane called notifying us our room was ready. We returned to Night and got our room key. This room, 42, had a double bed and was very tiny. It is similar to an inside cabin of a cruise ship. It would be sufficient for 1 or 2 people but not for us. There is only 1 small closet no drawers so plan on living out of suitcases. The bed is amazingly comfortable and when I asked for extra comforters and pillows for my son to sleep on, they were immediately brought to the room. The rooms have blackout curtains and when drawn the rooms really do mimic night which made it great for sleeping. The next day I was told we can leave all of our packed belongings in our room and when the king size room becomes available they will move everything for us. I was a bit worried that something would be forgotten but after a day of sightseeing we retrieved our new keys to room 78 and was delightfully surprised. All our belongings made the transfer. Since it was late they turned down our bed and had relaxing music playing. I was definitely pleased. This room was larger. We were able to live out of our suitcases comfortably and still have an area for my son to sleep. The location of this hotel is half a block from time square.

I loved the decor of the rooms, all black and white with wallpaper and nice features. This made me pleased to come back to the room at night after exploring this great city. I have to say if this style doesn't excite you, everything else about the hotel is quite standard. There is plenty of room around the bed to move around and put our luggage. No luggage racks though which is a negative. The king bed was not what we would call a king bed in Australia. It was very wide but not long enough. We're a pretty tall couple and it was annoying that our feet hit the wooden bed end. The low bed end was also a pain when I flopped on the bed and forgot it was there (ouch!). The bathroom is small but clean. Important to note that the little bar fridge cannot be used for your own items unless you pay a $50 fee and you are automatically charged for anything taken out of the mini bar (even if you put it straight back without consuming). Staff in the hotel were friendly and professional (we were given recommendations and assistance several times and had ice delivered promptly to our room) and housekeeping each day was thorough. Location is convenient but very close to Times Square so it can be noisy late at night and the Times Square crowds can get tiresome to navigate. By the end of our stay we avoided the area.

I quickly packed my bag and headed into the city. I travel a great deal, and as I said in my last review of this gem of a hotel, the staff here are on par of that of a 5 star hotel, if not better. Not only are they all quite lovely looking, but they are knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. And this can be said about all of their staff, housekeeping, door staff as well as the front desk. When I checked in I found that they had upgraded my room (lucky me!) and that the beds were as amazing as I had remembered (note to other travelers- these are by far the best beds I have ever slept in at any hotel in all of my travels. If you want a good nights sleep you will get it. The bed surrounds you in an oasis of comfort) the lines were still soft and good to the touch, and the towels (Frette of course) are the kind that feel good to the skin while still wicking away the moisture from your shower.It's quite simply a lovely hotel, that truly echos of luxury, a creative and daring eye in their decor, and sumptuous relaxation, with a top notch staff that I wish could be emulated in the other hotels I frequently travel too.Michelle you are a gem in the hospitality industry and the Night Hotel mirrors your true understanding of customer service and comfort.","Rhinebeck, New York","j g</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rhinebeck, New York</strong>",115,5.0

We arrived at Times Square around 3pm but unfortunately, the St Patrick’s Day parade was in full force and the road that the hotel is on was closed. As a result, we had to walk through crowds of people with 4 suitcases in an attempt get to the hotel; not something we wish to experience again! We eventually made it through to the hotel to find that there was nobody standing on the door to assist us. We struggled through the glass door with our cases whilst the 2 gentleman behind the reception didn’t move an inch to help. We felt that this was very rude given that we were clearly struggling. It was as if we didn’t exist, which is not how you want to feel upon arrival.The hotel is practically on Times Square but you don't experience any noise from the room at all. The rooms are small but adequate. As we were on the 2nd floor we heard a lot of noise from the bar on occasions, so we would recommend you ask for a room on a higher level. We were also placed right next to the cleaning cupboard and the cleaners insisted on slamming the door at 7am each morning which woke us up every day without fail. The room overall was very clean, which is the most important factor.As it was our first ever trip to New York (and in fact, to the United States) we wanted to book a helicopter tour, which Jonathan at reception kindly arranged for us within 5 minutes. We gave him a $10 tip for his helpfulness.The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Central Park, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre, and Fifth Avenue shopping. We took the subway down to Battery Park one day which was extremely convenient. It cost around $2.50 each for a ticket, and we were there within 10 minutes! The subway station is conveniently located within Times Square; you can’t miss it. You simply cannot go wrong with this hotel given its location!We would recommend this hotel to others given its perfect location however, should we be lucky enough to return to NY, we wouldn’t stay here again given that there are so many hotels to choose from along Times Square.","Solihull, United Kingdom","ClaireLou1988</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Solihull, United Kingdom</strong>",27,4.0

Bathroom (more black) had a shower that looked like it was assembled by Home Depot, except I doubt they carry all black finishes. Cheap black vinyl shower curtain, and nothing inside the shower to hold your toiletries. Not even a tiny ledge or shelf.

I am claustrophobic so was a little concerned. But when I saw the room I felt very relaxed. There was plenty of room to walk around the bed, and the bathroom was a nice size. At no time did I feel uncomfortable in the room. The elevator, however, was another story. It is very small and barely fits 4 people (tightly) at a time. I had to close my eyes and hold my breath when someone else was on it with me..The bar area was very dark and the seats are uncomfortable. If you need restaurant recommendations, make sure to ask. Over course of the time we were in NYC, asked front desk about specific types of food and were given great recommendations all within a few minutes walk from the hotel. The location is ideal if you want to do the tourist thing. It was a few minutes walk from either Times Sq or shopping on 5th Ave. Very close to all major subway lines. I also think this must be one of the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in. My room was spotless, and we saw cleaning people in the hallways every time we were coming in/out of our room and in the elevator.If you feel concerned at all about this hotel, or have any questions, I would suggest you reach out the the management either by phone or email.

The hotel is a boutique hotel with a slight adult theme. Its certainly more for couples than family. Low level lighting and risque photos are the decoration but it's never over the top and not embarassing, however I did find the bar a little pretentious but that's a purely subjective view and as it appeared busy it's clear not everyone shares my view.The hotel is ideally located for all the midtown Manhattan sights and shopping. Based on 45th, just off Times Square, it is mid way between the Empire State Building and Central Park. It's near enough the perfect location for dropping shopping back before heading out to a bar, and there are plenty within staggering distance, or to one of the many local restaurants.Rooms are of a size to be expected in New York but the room is well designed so it doesn't feel cluttered. The most important thing of any room is the bed and here the hotel excels. I found the large bed to be extremely comfortable. Furthermore the air condition unit was quiet and efficient meaning a comfortable temperature at all times. The bathroom, along with the rest of the room, was clean and the shower good. Staff were friendly and room service was efficient without problem.However there were one or two very minor issues that keeps it from getting a 5 star rating. The lack of wifi in the room is disappointing and the hotel's attitude to the mini bar is slightly aggresive. The prices are ridiculous (but if you're fool enough to use it then that's up to you), but there is an emphasis on a $50 restock charge if you use the fridge. Why? What is perishable in there and why put a fridge in there if you then discourage people from using it either with the prices or threats of a charge. A set of drawers would have been a better use of the space. Overall though it was a very pleasant stay in a great location, I'd definitely consider the hotel and recommend it to any couple looking for a well priced hotel in a fantastic city.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Rob7005b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",26,4.0

I booked the hotel for a group of 4 of us (in our 30's) traveling to NYC for a night and did so based on the photos, reviews and price. After staying there, I would not hesitate to book again.

On this trip into the city, I continued to find myself intrigued by this hotel which boast of being ""sexy"". I caved in and decided to try this ""sexy"" boutique hotel nestled within walking distance to 5th ave and the diamond district. I cannot stress this enough, from the moment I walked in, I was treated as though I was in a 5 star hotel, and the surroundings were sexy and lush..... from the provocative photos lining the walls, the deeply seated couch in the entrance, to the Frette towels and wrap around you like a glove bed. I loved it. So much so that on my next trip in, instead of booking at the Ritz, I will book here again. This is a 4 star hotel for the urban sensual hip crowd, be it in their 20's, 30's or 60's.... it's a hotel meant for those who enjoy quality but not over the top ""showy"" opulence. Everyone from the front desk staff, to the housekeeping and front door attendant made sure that my stay was first rate. My ONLY complaints would be that there is no chocolate in the mini bar ( a very sensual food) and that even with the do not disturb sign up someone knocked on my door to restock the mini bar of something that was still available in my mini bar (diet coke and a can of pringles, there were still several left) and that I had to have a bit of a mini argument through the door with the person trying to restock even though I had with intent placed the do not disturb sign on my door. LOL, they insisted in restocking, I insisted that I was naked. LOL. Other than that, perfection. If you are a traveler that understands true quality, sensual surroundings and understands the concept of sq footage in a major city ( lack of ) then this is THEE hotel for you to try.JGStayed 1/30-2/1/2012","Rhinebeck, New York","j g</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rhinebeck, New York</strong>",115,5.0

The reservations personnal I was transferred to was very friendly, but she informed the front desk would be able to assist me better with this information. I was again transferred back to the gentleman that obviously could care less about securing business for this hotel. He was curt and not at all helpful.

The lobby and hallways had many provocative pictures hanging on them some with nudity and some without.The staff was great.

The decor when you walk in is amazing and the service was friendly but not too friendly. The room is small, but for the amount of time I spent in it, it was fine. The location was great - i arrived late Sunday evening so didn't step out until the Monday evening and it was a 2min walk away from Times Square. And a short distance to 5th Ave and the shops. I checked out Wednesday and my flight didn't leave until later that evening - they happily stored my bag for the duration of the day.They also gave a print out when the cleaner comes through to cover the weather and any touristy sites that I should be visiting. The only minor negative, is some of the paint in room was chipped. but given everything else was amazing it was easy to overlook.Overall a great stay and I am planning to stay there again next year.","Melbourne, Australia","the_skipster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",8,5.0

Our expectations for a New York hotel are clean, conveniently located, courteous and unique. The Night hotel exceeded our expectations! Our room was properly made up minutes after we left each morning and seen to again late afternoon or early evening when we were out. The staff from the doormen, concierge, front desk and maid service were helpful, polite, friendly and competent. The room could be considered small, but attention was paid to the layout so as long as you are organized you have more than enough room. I have read reviews about the lighting, but we felt it suited the ambiance of the hotel and I personally hate bright lighting. The price for the location and service was amazing. Literally half a block from Times Square and Theater road. About a 10 minute walk to either Macy's or Central Park. We didn't try room service or the bar food (the drinks at the bar were tasty and reasonably priced) as there are three Irish pubs and two delis right across the street, not to mention your choice of what seems like a million restaurants in a three block radius.

The staff are professional and friendly, we left a car curbside for the valet who was efficient and timely both with drop off and pick-up. The lobby and general ambiance of the hotel, dimly lit, white leather, staff dressed in well fitted all black apparel, I very much enjoyed the vibe. It is suggestive and depending on your mindset it may not be your cup, but I enjoyed it. Not at all seedy, it's clean, stylish and sophistocated. We stayed in Room 90, the penthouse, two floors, the entry floor has a modern decor and plenty of seating, a large TV with a fantasic sound system and great outdoor balcony. There is a small powder room and well stocked minibar. The bedroom and a full bathroom on the second level up a austere marble and glass staircase. My husband wasn't a fan of the round bed - he's a little tall and his feet hung off the edge, but I found it just as comfortable as a standard king, soft linens and pillows. Pocket doors separate the bedroom from the dressing room and a second pocket door allows for privacy in the bathroom. There were plenty of towles, and the robes were soft and warm. Double pedistle sinks were a welcome feature of the bathroom and we had plenty of room to ready for the evening without any difficulty, at all. I was positively thrilled with the balcony off the bedroom. We grabbed a quick bite to eat at the restaurant next door at the recommendation of the doorman, it was very good. Starbucks and another coffee shop are also adjacent/1 door down in the opposite direction. As far as a location - if you're looking for a property in the Time Square area - you can't beat it!I don't have a single complaint, I did find the elevators rather small - but given that this is a small property - it wasn't overly problematic.

I arrived to DIRTY sheets, curtains that wouldn't close, no shower gel, no snacks at the mini bar, no complimentary bottled water, the bathroom tiles had grout all over them, chips in the furniture, patches of paint peeling from the walls, stains on the carpeting and scratches on the floor.I called down to reception and asked for help, and an older man (I think his name was Dickson) was sent up. He giggled and told me that he wasn't going to change any sheets and that he didn't even know how. He also told me that he couldn't help me close the curtains. The person at the front desk (I think his name was Raymond) then came up with some sheets and changed them himself. When he left, I realised that he had not brought a duvet cover. I was too tired to call down again, so that night I slept without one, getting woken up every now and again from the incredible noise that the air-conditioning makes.Day 2I woke up feeling hungry and having no snacks in the room, I called down to ask if there was any room service available. The person told me ""no"" and that I could go across the road and get myself some breakfast at the Cranberry Deli. I later found out that there IS room service, just not at the time that I had asked. I also asked again for the curtains to be closed. Day 3The bathroom skylight started to leak. I called reception (again) to tell them about it, as well as to ask for the curtains to be closed (for the 3rd time) as there is a gym in the next block that looks straight in at the bed and the wardrobe area. There was also still no shower gel and the towels looked old and some were frayed. The skylight was fixed promptly, and the curtains finally got fixed, thanks to Michelle from Front Office, watching over it all. And therein lies the Night(mare) hotel's only saving grace. The staff ARE friendly and they DO try to help. But that's it. They can only ""try"". I spoke to the General Manager, Karla [--] and got some apologies and was offered a couple of hundred bucks off the rate I was originally quoted for those first 2 nights, free internet for more than the normal 1 device and some complimentary snacks, drinks and gym passes.Day 4My husband arrived to join me. I had informed Raymond on my arrival that my husband would be joining me on the 20th and that I would like for him to be registered as a guest. This was not done and when my husband arrived, the person at reception, Jonathan, was objectionable and didn't even offer to have someone help him with his bags. Not wanting to deal with this treatment, my husband decided to carry his large bag up the stairs himself. My husband also called down to ask for a DVD player before we went out for the day, as it was stated in the guestbook that they were available on request. When we got back to the room, there was a DVD player, just left by the TV, not connected. So, we had to call down to ask for someone to come and connect it. And after it was connected, we couldn't watch any TV; only DVDs.This type of service continued for the rest of the trip:- the bartender at the bar gave me a bucket of ice and a bottle of wine, to bring up myself, when I ordered it for the room. I carried it to the lift then returned to tell him it was too cold and heavy for me to bring up myself.- another bartender had to refer to a piece of paper to figure out how to make the drinks on the menu. And when we got those drinks, they were terrible and not drinkable.- the bedroom slippers are sized small. My husband had to walk around the room in socks as the slippers were too small.- the reception button on the phone stopped working, and when we went down to tell the Front Desk that it wasn't working, we were told that we should've dialed ""0"" - as if it was a well known fact.- then the message button on the phone also didn't work, so we couldn't retrieve any messages from the phone.- when we extended our stay, we checked with Lewis at reception if our room would be available for the rest of our stay and he said ""yes"". We proceeded to change our flight, paying extra to make the changes, and when we informed the front desk that we were confirming the extension, we were told that the room was not available. We managed to stay a few extra days, thanks to the intervention of the General Manager, then we left for the Waldorf. When a service-based establishment cuts corners, it is always obvious to the customer, as they are the ones who are left with a bad experience and inconvenience. The Night hotel needs to invest more in both the hotel and their staff. There are some good employees like, Patrick, Michelle, the maintenance guy who came to fix the leak, etc. But if there is always a high turnover of staff, particularly at the senior (GM) level, there won't be any follow through with systems and processes. And that's when the ball gets dropped. In a conversation with one of the staff, this is what I said, ""Don't apologise. I'm tired of hearing ""I'm sorry"". Saying ""sorry"" doesn't change the fact that I'm the one that's being inconvenienced. You need to fix this; not just say sorry and leave me to fix a mistake made by one of YOUR staff.""Coming from a long-ish stay guest in their Penthouse Suite, I think I can safely say that I doubt we'll return.",KL,"Rachelepoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>KL</strong>",7,2.0

We were aware of the ""night"" theme and fully researched the hotel prior to making our one night reservation. We knew the rooms were on the smallish side, expected them to be dark, etc. We are also accustomed to the pleasant ""quirks"" of small boutique hotels. With this in mind, I requested a room on a high floor, and away from the elevator. Upon check in, I was dismayed to discover that we would be on the 4th floor and near the very noisy elevator. No options to change as they were fully booked. Ok. It was only for one night, we figured, no big deal. What we did not expect was a room so tiny, had we come with even a small carry on, there would be no place to put it. We did not expect a bathroom shelf outlined by rust, and a black shower with a filthy floor and dirty walls. When keeping with the ""black"" theme the staff should note that black attracts dirt, powder, etc. and make every effort to keep these areas clean. Someone noted that the honeycomb pattern of the tiles collected white ""gunk"" (my word) and man that was an understatement. We also had no bathrobe, or even glasses in the bathroom. All in all, for us, the funk did not compensate for the lack of attention to cleanliness. To add insult to injury, we were waken at 3 am by another loud guest banging on hallway doors.

You can't blow dry your hair in there because it is hazardous! The restaurant/bar area is very nice, but completely dead..

The decor is interesting, although the rooms are too dark. It was very difficult to put makeup on or even get dressed. We booked a King room and asked to be away from the elevator as we'd read a review indicating it's noisy near the elevator at night. We were put in a good-sized room facing the street, which was incredibly noisy, especially with the team of about 100 construction workers across the road that start work at 6:00am. So we awakened daily at 6:00 with steel bars being dropped, hammering and other annoying building noise. Traffic and pedestrians were very loud, too, much of the night. The bed was comfortable with good quality bedding and a feather mattress pad. Having a bad back, my husband did not sleep well... nor did I with bursitis in my hip. A firm mattress would have been much more appreciated. As would sheets that stayed on the mattress. The washroom was small and without a tub. After all the walking in the Big Apple, it would have been great to be able to soak our aching bones and feet in a tub, but the shower was good and worked well.The lounge at the back of the main floor was also incredibly loud, blaring ""disco"" or dance music most of the time. And the walls in the rooms are paper thin, so conversations in the hallway sounded like they were in our room. One such conversation woke me up before 6:00, before the construction team startedThe staff were mostly very friendly, especially the concierge/porter and some of the front desk staff. I had specifically requested a quiet, special room as we were in New York to celebrate my husband's birthday. The manager had promised to put us in a larger room away from the elevator, which she did. However, it was not at all quiet. She had also said that the hotel would greet my husband with a complimentary bottle of champagne, which never did appear. Not that I'd ever expected such a gift, I was somewhat embarrassed as I'd made the mistake of sharing the email with my husband. The nightly chocolates on our pillow and when we arrived were his treat; a nice touch nonetheless, as with many hotels in NYC.The rate was discounted, but substantially higher than some of the specials offered for other nice boutique and chain hotels we've stayed at in the past in Manhattan, so overall we were a disappointed. The walk to the subway took us through Times Square each time. Many other hotels we've stayed at are a bit closer to transit. Would we go back? I'm not sure. It would depend on rates and if the hotel offered the best price... and a guarantee to be somewhere away from the elevator and towards the back of the hotel.","Toronto, Canada","Irene W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",177,3.0

So we chose the Night Hotel. which is almost right across the street. We liked almost everything about the Night. The room was a nice size with a fantastic decor. The bathroom was very nice with a good shower. My only quibble was with the ""closet."" While one one hand, I admire the ingenuity, it leaves a bit to be desired. What they have done is attach a coat rack to the top of their minibar fridge. It is a clever use of space, but it fails on some counts. First, the distance from the hanger bar to the top of the fridge is too short for most dresses and pants on clipped hanger. Since they provide no normal pants hangers, this point is crucial. And the mirror on the back of this contraption is useless since it is obscured by the hanging clothes. They would serve their guests far better by simply installing a hanger bar on the wall in that same corner and putting a shorter fridge under it. Then a full-length mirror on the wall by the bathroom door would make sense. But, this hiccup did little to detract from our very enjoyable stay at the Night. With a Starbucks just a few doors away, breakfast is easy. The service in the hotel is excellent, and the decor of the lobby is sexy and hip. It is an easy walk to theaters, subway stations, and shopping. You cannot beat the location.

The 'closet' fit about 4 items and a pair of shoes so don't count on keeping the room neat and organized! The 'desk' was a nice-looking but impractical setup with a stool and very little space to even lay things on. The bathroom was less than ideal - the metal vanity shelf had visible rust that made me uncomfortable using the facecloths that were folded on it. I also didn't feel comfortable putting my toothbrush or anything like that on the shelf, which meant I had to either leave it on the very small sink area (and be splashed when washing hands) or, as I did in the end, stuck it in the pocket of my partners toiletry bag, because mine didn't fit anywhere.Ladies, this hotel is a nightmare for getting ready to go out. I don't spend too long on makeup and don't consider myself too high maintenance but felt even the little bit that I do was challenged by lack of counter space and ridiculously low lighting. In every part of the room. I would have given up the lights under the bed for a makeup light or anything else. I couldn't see anything!!Finally, the bathroom had a very strong mold smell - couldn't attribute it to the shower curtain but it really bothered me. The all black tiles in the bathroom also showed a white honeycomb pattern after the shower that made me a little grossed out - its probably normal and just unseen on the traditional white/neutral tiles so I blame design in this case.Finally, while I found the staff at the front desk to be very warm and charming, the bar staff seemed quite abrupt and inconvenienced by our presence. On the first day while waiting to check-in I wandered around and someone in the lounge just stared after me, no greeting, no acknowledgement, just a bored look.We actually became engaged while on this trip and when we went down to the bar to celebrate after the proposal with a drink around 12:30am, there were a few people near the bar section so we moved into the lounge to sit at a table. Then a women called out in a really abrupt tone ""uh, we're closed"" (I don't know how to indicate the 'duh' undertone she had in her voice') There was no apology, no smile, more of a ""what on earth gave you the impression we are a functioning establishment in the middle of NYC"". My guess is that there wasn't a lot of traffic as it was a wednesday and the staff decided to close early. Which would have been fine - it really was the tone that absolutely ruined our mood and made us feel kind of stupid, like we walked into a private party and were stupid tourists who didn't know how things worked. Looking back, I'm both embarrassed, disappointed, and a little annoyed at that one simple evening. (Totally recognizing that may be disproportionately focusing on this because it was a big night but still.) My fiance was really disappointed because with the rain and everything we didn't feel like venturing out just for a single celebratory drink. So I would sum this hotel up as a great home base with a little bit of attitude - part of which works in terms of the style but another part that tries to impart an air of exclusivity that is inhospitable.",Toronto,"swtpeaz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",9,4.0

Then wifi was not including and they charge you a whopping 10 dollars per night for the privilege of using their service, then they have sensors in the minibar which tells them how many times you have opened the fridge door and they charge you 30 bucks if you store your own items in there. Finally the rate changed between both nights I was there, for no extra amenity apart from a bath robe (one for two people) which was questionable in cleanliness. Oh and the view, there was none.

The Night Hotel is in a terrific location ~ only steps from Times Square! I stayed three nights and was pleasantly surprised at how friendly most of the front desk was and how clean and quiet the rooms were. The hotel only has one elevator but it was very quick. The rooms were very small and had a minuscule closet but turndown service always cheers me up and made me forget about my small room. They did not have a gym in the hotel but offered $15 passes to the nearby Equinox. Overall I was pleased with my experience and I feel that this was a great value for the money (considering the alternatives). I will be back!

On arrival at the hotel we were impressed, the reception and bar area is very nice, dark decor, minimalistic and very modern. The girl on reception, I didn't catch her name, was very helpful and friendly. Check in was smooth with no issues. We were given a room on the 7th floor, with myself being 7 months pregnant we opted for the lift. There only seemed to be one lift for the whole hotel and as a result, it was very slow and we had quite a wait for it. We got to our room and couldn't believe how small it was! One of the smallest hotel rooms we've every stayed in and we do travel a lot! Having said that, it was nicely decorated with a black and White theme, again very modern and minimalistic. The bathroom was very small also and decorated in black tile. Some aspects of the bathroom were very worn, such as tiles around the shower area had lost their colour and had been faded/chipped and looked old and untidy. There was also a metal shelf type thing above the sink which had started to rust and generally gave the bathroom an old/tatty feel. I feel for $260 dollars a night we didn't receive value for money. Another issue we had was with the a/c in the room. As I said before, I'm 7 months pregnant and the weekend we stayed, NYC was experiencing a heatwave, it was over 100 degrees so the a/c was very necessary! However this unit in our room sounded like it was 100 years old! It was so noisy and my husband and I didn't feel we really go a great sleep either night due to this. The bed was also small and neither my husband and I are particularly tall but we felt like our feet were touching the bottom of the bed! I dont know how someone 6ft or over could have slept comfortably in the bed!Overall, the hotel is a fantastic location with friendly staff. However, we are due to return to NYC in a few weeks and I will be looking for another hotel to book. I just don't think this hotel is worth the prices it charges.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","nbennett87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",8,3.0

The hotel tries to turn it's small space into a sexy S&M concept with the black decor and steamy pictures hung up in the dark lobby, but really it just ends up making the place feel small and claustrophobic.

Much is made of the decor - yes, it's dark - but at its core it's a small, boutique hotel. Remember this is NYC so don't complain about the room size - these rooms are small, but clean and nicely decorated. Most importantly, the beds are comfortable and the customer service was very good.If you're visiting NYC as a tourist you really can't get a better location - a block away from Times Square and smack in the middle of the theater district. You're also within walking distance of several subway lines, and there are plenty of eating options nearby too.However if you're a business traveller - as I was - this is not the place to stay. What serves as a desk is not very comfortable to sit at for any length of time and I actually worked with my laptop in bed. It can also get a bit overwhelming to have to push through the crowds when I'm trying to catch a subway downtown for a meeting. Lastly, you have to pay for wi-fi. In some ways it was easier to head to the nearby Starbucks to grab a coffee and get online there. What was nice though was that the front desk scheduled a car to get me to JFK on an early flight and even gave me a call to let me know the driver had arrived early. A few drawbacks. I saw a couple of comments about the elevator. I had no problems with elevator wait (I was on the 5th floor) and most of the time walked down. And while I loved the black and white decor it doesn't always work for bathrooms, especially if you're a woman trying to put on her makeup in the morning. In Night's favor I found my room surprisingly quiet - I'm not sure if there weren't many people on my floor but aside from hearing a few people in the hall early in the evening I slept very well. What I did hear was the construction noise from across the street, so if you're susceptible to light sleeping bring earplugs. Actually if you're not used to sleeping in NYC you might want to bring them anyway. All in all Night is a great choice if you're a tourist visiting NYC. My next business trip I won't be staying here.","Seattle, Washington","mcshan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",52,4.0

Our first visit to New York. We loved it and had a great time visiting, what a great place to visit. The doorman was very helpful and friendly, and assisted with the luggage right out of the cab to our room. The lobby was dark; I tripped on the luggage as we headed up to our room, but remember we had traveled for 12 hours and we were tired. The receptionist was very pleasant and helpful. Very professional. The hotel manager had a bottle of champagne in our room for our 30th Wedding Anniversary, very nice touch. The elevator was quite tiny. We went up while our luggage had to wait for the elevator to return to the first floor to allow the bellmen and the cart with our luggage to follow. The room was small, so was the bathroom, reminded me of an inside cabin on a cruise ship. Not much room for our four pieces of large luggage, but was ok once we maneuvered everything in the room. We didn’t eat or drink there, but there was a small lounge and dining area in the hotel on the first floor. The Night Hotel is half a block from Time Square. Very convenient for people who like to walk. On 4 June there was a street fair within a block or two of the hotel where there were a variety of venders with knick-knacks, food and artwork of all sorts. If you like to walk, you could walk to “Ground Zero” and see the progress of the re-building of America. My overall satisfaction was Very Good, but dark and gothicky. Kind of gloomy in the hall ways, pictures throughout the hotel were nice. The whole hotel experience was great, not sure if would recommend it to the finicky traveler.

Rooms are a bit small, but immaculate, with a super comfortable bed. Daily cleaning service, and the staff learns your time routines quickly. Once they figured out we slept in a bit late, they never disturbed us again with early cleaning visits. Concierge was extremely helpful and accommodating. You can store your luggage on the checkout day if you need to run errands before leaving for the airport.","Tulsa, Oklahoma","diabri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma</strong>",1,4.0

We wanted a hotel that was reasonably priced with a central location and this place scored points all round. Not only was the price great for New York but it was just a minutes walk from Times Square. The location was fantastic. The hotel itself was very unique, just like my friend and I, it was decorated beautifully and stood out, if you stay in a chain hotel you could be in any city in the world, but this had New York all over it. The staff were exceptionally helpful and the service was wonderful.

The interior of the reception and the rooms, is original and does have the boutique feel, which I really really liked. Breakfast being included as well was a bonus, but limited choice and did get get a little tiresome after the 4th time of having it - but there arent many hotels in New York which offer breakfast included, so you don't need to have it.The room was sooo nice, uniuqely designed curtains and thick comfy carpet, there was a complimentary robe and bath products, room service happend twice a day if we nipped back in the afternoon they would come once we had gone back out. Threy would also leave a weather print out, which was a nice touch.The location of the hotel is amazing, a two minute walk and your on times square, 20mins your at central park, and metro stations are on every other corner, it really felt as though everything was on our door step. On the down side, the bathroom was rather small and did flood a little when the shower was on due to the screen not being big enough. The lift is a night mare, there is only one and it is really slow, but theres stairs which gave us a little more exercise after our long days. Due to the hotel being small/boutique, the hotel lacks a view and is over looked, but again New York is a built up area.Over all I would definitely recommend this hotel, the price we paid was amazing. The interior is fab, the bed was huge and comfy which allowed us to have great nights sleep. It was our first trip to New York and the hotel made it an amazing trip.","Clitheroe, United Kingdom","NicHH82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clitheroe, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

We personally did not find it dark (once we worked out how to use the light switches). They were extremely clean, comfortable and romantic. The room amenities were also excellent.From the moment we arrived, the staff at the hotel were nothing but friendly and helpful. They arranged a transfer to JFK, chatted to us at the bar and when we informed them the mini bar wasn't working they came to fix it within 10 minutes.The bar is lovely and well priced, with very friendly bar staff. The smoking court yard at the back is a lovely addition. The hotel has lovely touches, such as free playing cards in the lobby, postcards, books and timeout magazine in the bedroom. The turn down service with chocolates and the weather report for the next day was a also a thoughtful touch. The location is fantastic, just off times square yet the street was fairly quite. It is situated in a really good location for sight seeing by foot and is close to the metro stations. There are plenty of great bars, restaurants, cafes and delis close by.

She apologized and asked us to wait outside until she gave the room clearance (it was only a minute or two), it was NO big deal at all; honestly we were thankful someone is on staff to check on those things!

There were multiple black and white pictures of orgy scenes, some involving partial nudity. While these photos would not stop me from returning to the hotel, or recommending it, I would suggest the designers choose photographs appealing to a wider audience.

The Queen room I stayed in was well equipt, but had little free floor space and the shower room was difficult to move in. Given the concept is gothic it's unsurprising there's no natural light, but I'd be struggling to spend more than a few nights like that.I'd recommend to someone going for a few nights and looking for something a little out of the ordinary, but on any longer a stay I suspect the novelty would wear off.","London, United Kingdom","RossFarquhar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",38,4.0

This Hotel is not about being a number in hotel but being made feel special from the minute you walk in.The rooms aren’t small or big they are NYC standard, so when people complain about small rooms they should have went to Disney, NYC don’t do big rooms. The rooms are spotless and well maintained, with the most sink into mattress I have ever slept on, I hate my bed at home now. Rooms contained a huge TV and a Bose radio, no I Pod / Phone connection in the room I stayed in. However reception staff charged my phone any time I asked.

My 18 year old daughter is disabled, and uses a wheelchair. She and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont, on 34th and Lex. My son (nearly 20), his girlfriend, 19, and friend, 20, I put into 2 rooms at the Night Hotel. Reasons I did this; I wanted to allow them to be in Times Square, and I wanted them to have the luxury of independence from me. I thought it would be a great learning experience. So, this is it in the nutshell: there are good and bad things about this hotel. First, look at the photos on the website- they are absolutely accurate!! They do not show the ""nice"" rooms, while hiding the bad stuff...everything is exactly as you see it...in a word, cool. The hotel is all black and white, decorated in a very contemporary way. Several reviews called it ""dark"". It is. But in a very hip and young way. My son is a tattooed and pierced young man. I picked this place because when I saw the photos and read the reviews, I said, "" This is my son. This is totally Cody."" We arrived to a very nice receptionist, with a wonderful, helpful demeanor. The rest of the staff? Not so much. I had my daughter, of course (in her wheelchair), and the teens all had luggage. We had the door opened for us. No one offered help to get the luggage to the room or to help us in any way at all. After 5 minutes, while I was still signing all of the papers (paperwork for 2 rooms took a few minutes), the doorman came up to me and said, ""Uuummm, what are you gonna do with your car?"" (Which was out front), even though it was obvious I couldn't move it yet as I was still working with the clerk. Oh well...we went up to the rooms. Sam's wheelchair and I barely fit into one elevator car. She is not in a full sized wheelchair. If you use a wheelchair...you won't fit!!! Don't stay here!! We went upstairs: I had requested a high floor. We got the 2nd floor. My son's room was one with a King sized bed. The other room was a queen. Both were very, very hip and cool to look upon. Their review of the comfort of the bed? Fantastic! They said everything was feathers and all three loved the rest they got!!! On the flip side: no ""Do not disturb signs""!! So, although we were there for the weekend, they were disturbed at 8 a.m.! I am told the maid was obnoxious, did not knock, just let herself in, woke them up, and was rude on top of it!! Are you kidding? This doesn't even happen at the Holiday Inn! (neither room needed maid service, incidentally.) They also commented that each morning the noise housekeeping made was just unbelieveable. My son also says this, ""Although the room was great, and looked amazing, some things were messed up, like the toilet paper spindle, which was 1/2 detached from the wall...it was cheap-not kept up well."" They all say that the location was stellar. It was! It was in Times Square, and they loved walking out of the hotel and into the heart of NYC at all hours of the night and day. We all say this: the rooms are pretty teeny, although if you are there for the atomosphere and decor, it is okay. However, I could not get the wheelchair down the hall, into the room, and turned around. We had to back down the hall to get to the elevator. We never could have stayed there!! The halls are dark. If you are young and don't need light...no problem, it is part of the feeling of the hotel. If you have a problem with that though...not a place for you. The last hour of their stay was the worst, unfortunately, and this is what they will remember. The night before, I called to ask if we were all set for check out, as they had all of my credit card info, and I had signed everything. I was told yes, all set! A few minutes later, I got a call saying I had to go there to check them out. I asked why, and explained that since I was in another location that would make things so difficult. The clerk said if I could just get there by 1:00, since I was leaving my hotel at 12:30, we would be fine. So I was content with that answer. Unfortunately, all three teens started calling and texting me at 12:15 to say they are getting kicked out and I had to get there RIGHT NOW to sign papers and check out or I would be charged for ANOTHER night!!! Getting my disabled daughter out of our place, everything packed, getting the car, etc...all a lengthy process! My last 30 minutes in my beautiful hotel was ruined because I was in panic mode, trying to get out and to the Night Hotel to avoid paying for 2 rooms for another night!! At the last second, as I was already on the way, the hotel called to say, ""Oh, sorry, we just need to confirm your information, and you are all set."" Unbelievable!! So much stress for no reason at all. And the teens said the level of rudeness was so high that morning that they wouldn't stay there again no matter how cool it was, or how great the location- this from teenagers!! Sooo...you can decide: it is clean, it is cool, it is in a great location!! The prices are good!! But choose wisely: if my negatives wouldn't bother you, try it! If they would, stay away!! (My daughter and I stayed at a hotel called the Affinia Dumont, about 20 blocks away...see my review. It was close in price, but I had not a single negative thing to say about the place) This is a niche hotel. Not for everyone.","Kirkwood, NY","missmediasmom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkwood, NY</strong>",29,3.0

We were disappointed, really disappointed and oddly - the hotel itself eg. the building, is good.. there's nothing wrong with it - small rooms as expected in New York city, trendy carpet, little bathroom that tended to flood somewhat but hey... It's decent. Breakfast in the morning is badly organised with everything sitting in a tiny corner and 20 people all trying to make toast/get coffee etc in a spot that is big enough for 2 isn't the best though good that breakfast was included! The only real draw back, which initially I guess I thought was the draw card... This place is seriously dark. It might be suitable for others but I found it gets you a little bit down being in a dark place so long. The only flaw with the hotel itself is the loudness of the air conditioners, apparently the sound which is similar to a car motor in your room, is normal for New York so could have accepted it had my concerns been handled differently. What I couldn't accept was the rude, useless, lazy and inconsiderate staff that worked in this place. One girl in the bar was lovely but wasn't actually being paid by the company and working for tips so of course she was friendly, a second girl in the bar was scary (!) singing around the place and really making me feel extremely uncomfortable. (Restaurant doesn't have much to offer and very small menu.) The porters/door men I guess you would call them were lovely... but the reception staff! Wow... Cannot describe these people, I asked for ear plugs on the first night to deal with the a/c - ''we don't have any - there's nothing wrong with the air con"" - the Manager later states we have a huge stockpile of ear plugs! We had booked for 8 nights - they chose the smallest room they could for us. The staff stare blankly when told there's a problem with the a/c - expect us to wait around indefinately whilst they don't bother to get someone to fix it, they sigh and roll their eyes when we explain our disappointment. They swapped our room 3 times in the end. Once the porter had us pack our bags to move rooms, when we returned to the hotel later that day we were basically acused of lying and told that the porter hadn't said anything and he'd gone home so we weren't moving. No consideration that we'd now packed our bags 3 mornings in a row... Finally on the 3rd move we were offered an upgrade for our troubles but we had to point out to them this was a good idea!! In the end when the hotel Manager returned, he was really understanding and offered a free meal and took a little off our bill. This was good but our stay was already ruined by his staff. Having to walk past them every morning and evening really put a downer on our time New York. We had so many issues whilst staying here. I would recommend you stay anywhere but here.Also - a note on the location - last time I stayed in New York I stayed in Chelsea and not so near to the action (Night Hotel is 2 minutes from Time Square). I think having a refuge from Tourists and crowds such as Chelsea was a much better choice!

After emailing several locations with no response, Tom and Jhoanna both contacted me and were very helpful. Staying at the Night was an excellent decision. The service and the room decor was amazing. Even though our reservation was short notice and there were no Suites available, the room was just enough for our stay. The two ladies who handled our reservations were extremely helpful, particularily one to mention ( and I can't recall her name) shared some tips about the area and her marriage. I also want to thank the Doorman for his help. Although our stay was short with respect to timeframe, the Night's location made our ability to manuever around the city on foot so much easier.

Upon arrival, I was told that my room had been given to somebody else, but that because this was their own fault, I would get a FREE upgrade to the Penthouse Suite! The customer service was very helpful, and friendly. The two ladies who helped me were named Anna, and Christi. They were both excellent and should be given a huge raise!The location of the hotel is perfect, right near times square.

My friend and I had to walk to the hotel from Penn Station because the cab line was so long. Just so you know...it's possible! When we arrived we were very impressed with how sharp the hotel looked. The people at the desk were very friendly (although when we asked for a seafood hotel suggestion, one of the girls recommended Red Lobster!). The room was very spacious for New York standards and it smelled great. The lights were on and the radio was playing, which we really liked. We ate at a wonderful Greek restaurant the first night, Kellaros. Jersey Boys was wonderful, and the hotel is steps away from Times Square, yet it's very quiet once you're in the room. At one time, there must have been a free continental breakfast, but that didn't come with our room, so we walked across the street to the Cranberry Cafe and got a coffee and pastry the next morning for $3.00. There is also a Starbucks next door. The next night we tried Bobby Van's next door. We just had bread, two appetizers, and drinks. It ws quite expensive but they were perfectly fine with us just getting appetizers and were very friendly. Back to the room, our towel rack had fallen off the wall so we both had to use the hook on the back of the door, but this wasn't really a problem. The bed was very comfy and there was turn-down service each night (with chocolates). I would definitely stay here again.

We originally had reservations at the Waldorf Astoria for our first trip to NYC and to celebrate our first anniversary. Upon constant bad reviews, I changed our reservations to Night and what a smart move! We arrived 8 hours before check in and expected to just leave our bags and go explore until we would be able to check-into our room. Christine surprised us by saying that she had a room available right then! Wonderful customer service. Our room was great. Was a little nervous of the ""goth"" look but it is very well done. Bed was very comfortable, room size was fine, room and bathroom VERY clean. Only thing we found wrong was the bathroom fixtures were a little loose and the shower head was broken but still functional (water sprayed in numerous directions). Nothing major in my opinion. Christine also found out that it was our anniversary and there was a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us when we returned one night. That really hit it home for us. The Night hotel acknowledged a very special day for my husband and I. So if you are looking for a great location to times square it doesn't get any better than this. You walk out the front doors turn left and walk less than a minute, you are right in the middle of times square!Best customer service, best location, best value for your money.

The location is excellent: it is in the heart of Times Square, walking distance to theatres and restaurants, but despite its central location, it isn’t particularly noisy by Manhattan standards. We were able to sleep with the window open. The rooms are clean, and are the same size as your average Manhattan hotel room. The beds are comfortable enough, though they are topped with feather mattresses that do slide a bit.The Bad:The bathrooms are also stylish, but they are barely functional. The water pressure in the shower is atrocious, and you’re either freezing or scalding. The toilets don’t flush well. The climate control in the room was so noisy that we couldn’t hear each other speak while it was on. The rooms are poorly lit – there are simply not enough lights, and the ones that you do have aren’t bright enough -- and the black on black furniture and decor doesn't help this at all. If you have black accessories, black clothing, or black electronics, they disappear against the black on black on black everything. Plan on spending some time each day just locating your possessions. The staff is indifferent at best, and many of them were just too cool to be helpful or friendly. We were barely acknowledged at all during our trip. The front desk staff is not welcoming. I’m not sure how else to put that. It wasn’t until the last day that the front desk person was pleasant or helpful at all. The complimentary breakfast was as delicious as airline food. Seriously, eat breakfast somewhere else.Very, very little in the way of services and amenities, and the Wifi did not work properly the entire time we were there.We wouldn’t stay there again, and I would not recommend this hotel. We will certainly be looking for other lodging for our future business trips to NYC.

Times square is at your doorstep ! The reception staff were cordial , they welcomed but you could sense it was because of duty and job description . the guy on the door was cool ( cant remember his name ) he was really helpful and made us feel at home , The room we had was small but enough space to move around , the bathroom was small but managable . A big negative was a tiny window if you could call it that looking out to a back alley ...claustrophobic ,no natural light and room very dark . Having said that I enjoyed my night there as the vibe of hotel was great ,sexy and cool . One night was enough but if I was on a longer break I would not have been comfortable . NYC is a busy and fast paced city and this is captured in this hotel .For the ladys .... there was not enough light in my room to put makeup on , I had to get my boyfriend to take a photo so I could see myself a little better !I would not reccomend this hotel for familiys , If your in NYC for one or two nights to party then go for it .....!!!","Dublin, Ireland","jodyjo186605</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",0,3.0

Everything that you read with respect to the room is probably correct. I have stayed in many NYC hotels and this is by far the smallest I have ever been in. We had a window that looked directly onto a brick wall! The beds are super comfortable and I'll admit, if you are spending considerable amounts of time in your hotel, you shouldn't be in New York. It works for a place to sleep but if you are spending more than one night, I wouldn't spend it here. It is simply too small. In addition, we tried to get a drink at the hotel bar after the concert (12:30 am ish) and it was closed. I didn't know anything in New York closed that early. The location is good if you are into Times Square as it is half a block from everything.

The hotel seemed clean...but it is so dark everywhere it was hard to know for sure. The hotel is trying so hard to be boutique chic...but I don't quite think it makes the mark. The site that I booked from rated the hotel as 4 star...it is 3 star at best. It is 2 minutes from Time Square, but I think next time I would sacrifice location for something a bit more elegant.

(will post some photos in a bit)The rooms are very black, especially the bathroom. There is no full length mirror. There is enough light to make yourself look good for the evening, but not for the daytime :-)The hallways are VERY noisy - your door insulates very little sound, and doors close with a huge bang! Hope you don't get neighbors who come in at all hours of the night. Keep in mind that the hotel also plays loud music throughout the building until about 11pm or so.There is mood lighting under the bed. I want you not to look, though, since you may find things that your predecessors left behind.As for location, it is close to the busiest area of NYC. If that suits you, then the location is good.

It was my first time at New York and I´ve searched the web looking for prices of reasonable hotels in the Midtwon and I bumped into The Night. After reading all the comments that other users made at Tripadvisor (despite the negative ones) I decided to spend 6 nights at the hotel and it was the cleverest decision I could take. I have nothing to say but INCREDIBLE, SOPHISTICATED, ROMANTIC and GLAMOROUS. Let me share my comments about others negative comments: a) BREAKFAST: OK. It´s not a Wow breakfast but you have all the stuff you need for starting the morning. Coffe, hot milk, lots of bagels, some muffins, scrumbled eggs and bacon...the same thing (or even more) that you probably get if you go to breakfast at Starbucks. The good thing here that it´s for free!, b) SHOWER: Despite there´s a narrow glass the covers the bathtub it´s not true that the floor gets completely wet. What you only have to do is to throw a towel just beside the bathtub and ready! No water on the floor!, c) LIGHT: You don´t have to be very wise to realize that if you go to a boutique hotel called NIGHT the atmosphere will be related with the ""blacks"". I love spending my breakfast listening to chill out music in a darky and glamorous ambient as well as my room. Special details as daily chocolates and the printed weather forecast just over the bed were really appreciated, d) ROOMS: I was at a QUEEN room and I should say that it was perfect! It was not enormous but despite our ""hundred shopping bags"" we can move freely all over the room with no problems. If you go to NY for sightseeing I can swear you that you will leave the hotel at 10 Am and you don´t come back till 7 or 8 pm so what you will only need is a warm shower and an incredible bed and rooms at THE NIGHT get a 10!!!! e) LOCATION: Great! Excellent! You will only have to walk 50 meters to get at 45st and Broadway were everything happens! You want to buy tickets at TKTS? Ok! Just walk 2 blocks and you will find it. Perhaps some presents for your kids at Toys R us? Ok! Walk 2 1/2 blocks and you will be there! Starbucks? 20 mts from the main entrance. Planet Hollywood? Just at the corner!!!! Everything was near there!!!!!! Last, but not least, an special mention to Mr Thomas Carpenter (the General Manager of the hotel) who takes care personally of all our request and the ""Morocco"" guy who helped us with our luggage, some umbrellas when raininning and a warm and friendly ""hello"" everyday. ONLY one thing to mention. The Night is definitely a hotel for couples or business men/women. I would not recommed it for familys with very young kids as the ambient and the facilities are not prepared for ""the smallest"". Anyway I would not doubt to come back to THE NIGHT if I had the chance to visit NY again!!!!

The Bad: Upon check in we were greeted (use that term loosely) with a staff member that was less than helpful and frankly just seemed disgruntled every time we attempted to speak with her. Our shower would not drain properly which resulted in us standing in 4-6 inches of water after only a few minutes. After asking for the fourth time that it be fixed we gave up. It also appeared that the maids gave the room only a once over - as there were stains on the wall and the furniture. The Good: Great location.

The location is about 50ft from the middle of Times Square, Empire state, Rockafella, Chrysler, Grand Central Terminal, even Central Park at a push are all withing walking distance. Breakfast was continental with a little of bacon and eggs to make us Brits feel at home. The air conditioning was noisey but also soothing at the same time, the 40"" plasma was nice to look at while waiting for my partner to get ready in the morning. The hotel's location also mean't that there was a steady stream of the 'famous' yellow cabs waiting to be hailed, and it mean't you could get around the city relatively cheaply.
