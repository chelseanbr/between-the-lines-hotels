Mita subway and Tamachi rail stations are less than 10 minutes away, which is quite convenient, and around them are numerous eateries and small shops. It's a good establishment, but you should reserve a bigger room. Check-in was pretty easy and quick when I arrived at night. No problems with communication. The hotel's lobby and ambience are quite pleasant. Unfortunately I found my room small and cramped. It almost felt like one of those cheap Japanese business hotels. Overall I found it difficult to relax in the room. Once I opened my luggage, the room felt even smaller. There's also no real space to work on a laptop. At least everything seemed clean. The bed was ok and big enough. I appreciated the free bottled water. The TV had some foreign channels which was good. The free coffee in the room was quite yummy. Wifi was OK. Housekeeping seemed capable. The bathroom was not very large either. At least everything seemed clean and the shower gel, etc, were good products. There was no fan in there, which was kind of unusual. There is an interesting ""relaxation"" lounge on 1 of the floors. It has some interesting books and magazines, although unfortunately it doesn't always stay quiet, which can hinder the relaxation. If you need to go to the airport, the hotel can arrange a limousine bus, which is quite convenient. Be aware that it stops at other hotels after it picks you up, and so takes about 2 or more hours. Check-out on the last day was pretty easy. They stored my bags for a few hours while I had to go back out for some work, which was nice. Overall, the hotel is in a nice neighborhood and the staff is friendly, but if you stay here, make sure you book a larger room.","Kirkland, Washington","GMK1954</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, Washington</strong>",71,3.0

I enjoyed my stay here. The bedroom was comfortable and well equipped in terms of amenities. Compact by western standards but not particularly small for Japanese standards. I had a superior double room on the the top (17th) floor and the view from the large window in the room was nothing short of stunning. I even had a clear view of Mount Fuji on a couple of mornings when weather conditions were favorable. What more could you ask for. Breakfast was included for me and this was also great. Japanese or western breakfast options were available. The service provided was basically faultless. Everyone I came into contact with was courteous and efficient. It is worth mentioning that The Celestine is situated in a quiet area of central Tokyo. If you are looking for a buzz outside your hotel then look elsewhere. That said the Shiba area of Minato is quite upmarket so it is a nice area to stay in and walk about. Mita metro station is only a two minute walk away so you can access other areas of Tokyo quite quickly and efficiently using the excellent Tokyo metro system. Overall I thought The Celestine Shiba was excellent. Would be happy to use this hotel again.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom","R C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

I really like the style and aesthetics of the hotel, the rooms are tasteful, and the view is great. The location is also excellent, a few minutes’ walk from Mita (subway) and Tamachi (JR) station, in a less bustling business area but with lots of food options around. I would definitely be happy to come back but there are some small downsides. The superior double is a nice room but it’s quite small for two people with two large suitcases. It’s also a bit odd that there is no ventilation in the bathroom but a heated area of the mirror compensates somewhat. I booked breakfast for the first time, and the selection was adequate and good quality but not extensive, at least for Western dishes. I got a good deal where breakfast was nearly free but I wouldn’t pay full price for it. As in the last few years, the English level of the front desk staff was very limited, good enough for routine tasks but not much beyond that. On balance, a nice hotel offering good value.","Melbourne, Australia","melbguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",163,4.0

Our room, while smaller than what we’re used to (by North American standards), it was comfortable and well designed (good lighting, good use of space, ample plugs, etc). We enjoyed the 24-hr lounge with tea, coffee, cookies. It was a large, comfortable space and it was nice to have access to an outdoor seating area. The fitness room wasn’t large but it had a few standard pieces of equipment in good working order. The hotel is well located. It’s in a quiet area close to transit and reasonable walking distance to Roppongi, Ginza and about an hour walk from Shibuya crossing. The hotel was also reasonably priced.

The staff were welcoming in typical Japanese style and custom. The bar menu was very limited. The room was typical for Japanese hotels (small but utilitarian). Ample counter space but no desk space to work. Lots of bathroom amenities and the standard heated toilet seat. Remember to get a spare key to keep the room AC on or your room will be quite warm when you return from a day out. My irks with the experience: typical low bed and this one had a serious mattress issue (big depression). There was a left over slipper and lip balm under the bed (who knows how long it was there) and one of the glasses in the bathroom had been used and not replaced (although turned over to indicate is was “clean” to use). Luckily I always travel with a few small paper bathroom size Dixie cups. ,"Marlboro, New Jersey","682harrist</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marlboro, New Jersey</strong>",41,3.0

I arrived around 1:30pm and unfortunately there was no room available for me but the hotel held the bags while I went for a little wander. The lobby area was bright and spacious, complete with a bar and cafe. There was plenty of seating available (not just in the cafe) and the staff at reception were friendly and totally fluent in English. Other than the inability to check in early first impressions were certainly positive.Once I returned to the hotel it took just a few moments to complete the check in process and the lady behind reception explained the facilities of the hotel. It was great that my luggage had already been taken to the room and the three super fast lifts had me quickly there myself. In fact, throughout the stay, despite the hotel being apparently full there was never a need to wait more than a few seconds to be served by a lift which was great.My Superior Double room was on the 16th floor with brilliant views over the East of the city. As is a general trend for the city I’d been prepared for a small room but was pleasantly surprised with the space available. Both sides of the bed were easily accessible, there was loads of storage including a large wardrobe in the entrance area, plus a built in sofa in front of the window, giving a great place to admire the view and lights at night. The decor was clean and modern with units at both sides of the bed, complete with electric sockets and lamp. Each side also had controls for the lighting throughout the rest of the room. The mini bar was well stocked and there was a fantastic glass-fronted cabinet with other drink options, snacks and glasses, illuminated beautifully. The air-conditioning was effective and not too loud. The TV was a good size for the room but lacked any UK channels with CNN being the only English language channel.The bathroom was the disappointing aspect of the room, only because it wasn’t quite up to the same modern feel as everywhere else. The white fittings and taps / shower felt rather dated but fortunately was clean still. Everything worked well though, with the shower coming hot instantly and good power, the bath filled up quickly and was comfortable and, of course, the digital functions on the toilet was extensive. There were plenty of toiletries in small bottles provided as well as a bar of soap. The towels, although plentiful, were a little harsh and felt old, not as ‘fluffy’ as they perhaps should have been.Within the room there was every amenity imaginable provided. International adaptors for the electric sockets, pyjamas, slippers, gowns, stationary, full guide to the hotel services (although a bit more detail regarding dining options would have been good), plus the bathroom had every toiletry, toothbrush, shaving equipment, hairdryer etc - I couldn’t think of anything that I’d need which was missing!Sleep quality was incredible and there was absolutely no noise from the corridors or outside either. The lighting in the room was really cosy and suitable for all moods, including a night light which was wonderful. Housekeeping always observed the ‘do not disturb’ light, leaving a note if the room was missed. However I found they always proactively came back later in the day rather than having to request the visit from reception, like the note said. They always did a thorough job, leaving another two bottles of complimentary water each time.There was a residents lounge on the 14th floor which provided a nice retreat. With sofas and armchairs inside, as well as tables and chairs in an open courtyard it was an escape from the bustle of the rest of the city and hotel. It is open 24x7 and offers free tea / coffee, plus alcoholic drinks for a charge. It was a shame that there were no snacks available, but small plates could be ordered from the member of staff on duty. A TV showing some world news would have been a nice addition, plus maybe some quiet background music to add some atmosphere, but otherwise it was a nice facility to have available.The bar and cafe in the lobby area was nice, offering lunch time deals as well as smaller meals in the evening. Decor was nice, tables were large and everything was clean. Food was served quickly although the prices of drinks were a little on the high side, possibly to be expected given the location. I noted that the guides in the room stated that room service wasn’t available 24x7 so it was nice that the ground floor continued serving until late in the evening.Overall it was a fantastic base for a few days in the city. The location was quiet but easily walkable to many of the main sights, with transport connections almost on the doorstep. All of the staff throughout could speak great English and it was pleasantly modern. To be honest it could have passed for a five-star hotel and had it had a proper pool and proper bar would probably obtain it easily. I can highly recommend staying here and will certainly consider it when I’m in the city again.","Bedford, United Kingdom","stevebintley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bedford, United Kingdom</strong>",749,5.0

I want to share our experience since we were trying to be careful about expenses beyond the cost of the room. We were 2 family members who got a 'superior twin' room, which includes a small sofa by the window, for our 2-week stay. This arrangement was great for us because the sofa area meant we could hang out in the room without sitting on our beds; we also made use of the lovely lounge area on the 14th floor, where coffee, tea, and juices are always available. We picked the hotel because we wanted quiet for sleeping and a little extra comfort for buffering the challenges of Tokyo; our one worry in advance is that we would regret staying in more of a 'business' area of the city. We ended up not regretting it at all because the hotel is so conveniently located (near Mita, Tamachi, Shibakoen, and Akabanabashi stations, all of which we used)-it was easy to venture all over the city and know we'd have only a 5-10 minute walk to our quiet hotel at the end of the day. Shiba Park, nearby, was also fun to visit.We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants but ate at some other places in the neighborhood (including a friendly and extremely affordable Italian restaurant, Maruyama, which is only a few blocks away). We also took laundry to a coin-op laundromat that was about 3 blocks behind the hotel. We used the fitness room less than we'd expected, but it included treadmills and ellipticals plus some bands with handles and floor mats. We kept some provisions in the refrigerator in the room (yogurt, fruit, cheese) and managed to cater our own breakfasts most days plus some light snacks. (There is a small convenience store in the hotel and a number of others very nearby as well as a grocery store maybe 5 blocks away.) The hotel occupies 4 floors of a high-rise - hence our worries about the 'business' feel of the building and neighborhood - but we were really not aware of the non-hotel life of the building. The lobby is a hotel lobby with bar and restaurant; the four floors of the hotel (floors 14-18 - nice views) are somewhat self-enclosed, and from the hallway of the upper floors one looks down into the lounge and garden area of the hotel on the lowest 'hotel' floor. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful (for instance, someone found a scale so that we could weigh one of our suitcases). In short - we were not business travelers nor on a business traveler's budget, but the Celestine was a great home base for us and did not include any hidden costs. We felt extremely comfortable and were taken care of very well.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","NGfromPGH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",31,5.0

We changed out of our travel clothes in the bathroom and set off. On our return our room was ready and our bags had been taken up. The room was a good size by Tokyo standards, lovely comfortable bed and pillows, a lounge and desk, tea/coffee etc. the bathroom was “cosy” with shower over bath but quite adequate. We organised luggage transfer to our next destination and it happened without a hitch. The area is quiet but has convenience stores, laundromat and restaurants within walking distance.

The hotel is very stylish with some nice added features, such as the reading lounge and outside seating areas. We did not eat in the hotel but it does have nice restaurants on site should you wish to do so. Our room was a ""moderate room"", which I would suggest is too small for a couple on an extended stay. The bed is right against the wall on one side with limited circulation generally in the rest of the room. There is only limited storage, consisting of 6 hangers in 2 of the shallowest wardrobes I have seen in a hotel. Having said that we still thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would stay there again, but in a bigger room. It is well situated within walking distance of the Tokyo Tower, Zojoji Temple and Meiji Shrine. The subway system in Japan is amazing and we were spoilt for choice of stations close by.

The best thing is that there are two metro stations nearby including being on the circular Yanamota line (and Mita Station has a direct train to Narita airport although it is worth checking the times as it is not as regular as the local metro).The hotel lobby is impressive and the staff were all extremely friendly. I would suggest that they give local area maps to guests on check-in. We were not given one but upon talking to concierge during our stay, they provided one to us and it had various restaurants marked on the map too which was useful.The rooms are on higher floors. Our room was smaller than we expected, even by Tokyo standards, and it was hard to keep our suitcases out at once. The window gave us an amazing view of Tokyo city and the bay area, which was even better at night.

The check-in was quick and efficient, and the reception in general is very helpful and accomodating.We had a room on the 17th floor, with panoramic views over the City. Quite remarkable, really.

As expected they are smaller than Western standards but comfortable with a small sitting area. Every day 2 bottled waters were provided. The room amenities were beyond anything I’ve ever experienced – robes, slippers, pajamas, unexpected toiletries like toothbrushes, a mini hairbrush, a razor, and shaving cream on top of the standard items you expect. Ladies, the hair dryer works really well. It styled my hair better than my own, LOL. The biggest plus is the phone they provide. We used it daily to help navigate around Tokyo. They also offer a currency exchange machine in the lobby. Just feed in your dollars and it spits out yen. Not sure how good the exchange rate was but it was super helpful and convenient. For breakfast we kept it simple by eating at Tully’s around the corner (closed on Sunday’s) or picking something up from FamilyMart, or Lawson’s. By the way, you can’t bring outside food to the 14th floor lounge. Very limited restaurant choices in the immediate area. We walked about .5 miles for more options or ate before we returned to the hotel. If you don’t speak Japanese, do your research. Look for places with English reviews and/or menus with pictures. The people are extremely nice and will go out of their way to help language barrier and all.Pick of train stations were plentiful. The hotel is located near four stations– Shibakoen, Mita, Tamachi, and Oshiage. All are within a 10 minute walk; Shibakoen is the closest, it’s only a block away. The train system is elaborate and intimidating but totally awesome once you learn how it works. I made arrangements for a private guide to show us around the city and teach us how the train system works. Best money ever spent. After our lesson we were pros. OK, maybe not pros but we got around and didn’t get lost, that’s success in my book. Our return trip to Narita Airport was pretty simple. From the Mita Station (5 minute walk), take the Asakusa Line (airport express train). No transfers, just a direct shot. It was half the price of taking the Airport Limousine bus and faster. Don’t get me wrong, the Airport Limousine bus is also a great option. Pickup/dropoff is right outside the hotel so it is super convenient, less stress, and a no brainer. We took it from Narita airport to the hotel. There is ticket counter at the airport once you exit custom/immigration and the bus stop is curbside right outside the door. There are lots of airport transportation options, I found these two to be the best ones for Celestine Shiba as far as price and convenience.","San Francisco, California","AACH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,4.0

We had good use of the 24-hour lounge that was also on our floor. It had 24-hour coffee and tea, orange juice was served during the day. People were there working on their laptops. We saw a family with a baby once in there, so I guess the hotel is also baby-friendly. The area around the hotel is quiet at night as it is a business area surrounded by offices. I liked that this hotel was not in the busy areas of Tokyo like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, or Akihabara. There were a few metro stations within walking distance - Mita and Tamachi are what we used often.

We tried breakfast at both and I would say you can save money by booking the room without the breakfast included and just order what you want when you get there.

The hotel is in a nice quiet business district but we found some cute little streets close by for food. The staff are so polite and helpful and greeted us with a smile every time we walked through the peaceful lobby. The rooms are very comfortable with soft linen and large beds. The room wasn't huge but with the lovely window seat, you had a nice place to sit. The rooms come with everything you need, including an ironing board/iron and really nice white pyjamas! We had requested a quiet room on a high level with a view and I was so happy as they gave us a view that, though it looked onto another building, you could see the Rainbow Bridge clearly between the buildings.The breakfast was fantastic with fresh, good quality food and lots of variety. I was particularly impressed by Sumi who would remember that I liked soy milk and she'd bring it to me without me asking for it!The location means you need to catch a couple of trains to areas like Shibuya or Shinjuku, but the train travel is all part of the Tokyo experience. Staying 4 nights we became familiar with the quickest train lines to take.The gym is small so don't expect too much here but the lounge is a nice quiet space to sit.The only thing I would change is the pillows. They are quite small and one was too soft, one too hard. Apparently they do have foam pillows, which I prefer, but they were all taken.We really loved this hotel and highly recommend it for a high quality, comfortable, serene place to stay. It almost feels like a 5-star hotel.","Sydney, Australia","Iluvtravel1001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",58,5.0

The room was typical Japanese small but afforded a wonderful view of the city from 14 floors up. The large guest lounge with concierge was just around the corner and offered up complimentary coffee and juice. Nice size bathroom with good shower and a toilet seat with some surprises attached (it's our secret). The bar lounge on the main floor was big and had a limited breakfast, lunch and dinner menu but a larger bar menu. Taxis were always nearby or out front.

I stayed here 2 years ago and loved it, and it’s only gotten better. The guest rooms are on the 14th-17th floor, high above the city, and my view was great. One clear morning, I was even able to see Mt Fuji! The room is tastefully decorated, very warm and appealing, with a firm but not overly hard king size bed. Everything looks well maintained and in good shape, there’s some complimentary water, and while the room is not huge, it would be okay for two people. Not realizing the difference between room types, I’d originally booked a “moderate” room, the cheapest type, only to find that these rooms face towards the inside and are tiny. I took one look at the room and marched right back to the reception and asked for an upgrade. I paid an extra JPY 2000 per night for my much nicer room.The lobby is particularly appealing, very tastefully decorated, almost a five-star boutique hotel feel. The café in the lobby, Cellecroix, serves a breakfast tray in the morning if breakfast is not included in your rate, and it’s okay if you just need a small breakfast. There’s unlimited coffee refills. Otherwise, the hotel restaurant does a decent breakfast buffet, quality over quantity, with nice pastries and eggs cooked to order, but at JPY 2800 a bit pricey for what you get. The space in the restaurant is much improved over the bland and cold atmosphere from two years ago.Staff are unfailingly friendly, though most front desk staff have limited English—enough to get routine tasks done but they struggle if things get a bit more complicated. The location of the hotel is not in the center of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo but Toei’s Mita Station is a 5 minute walk away, so is Shiba-koen Station, and JR’s Tamachi Station is a couple of minutes more. I found the transport links very convenient. There are full-on eating streets behind Mita Station with endless choices of restaurants, and convenience stores all over the place.Overall, Celestine is a great place to stay in Tokyo, and I’ve already booked my next stay.","Melbourne, Australia","melbguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",163,5.0

The hotel is in a business district and so is very quiet at night, however many great little eateries are only about 5 minute walk away. Ask the concierge for a map of the local area. The subway is only a few minutes and JR Tamachi station about 10 minutes walk. There is a 7/11 downstairs at the rear of the hotel and a coin operated laundry around the corner.

I have previously reviewed this place twice and all the positive things I said about this place still applies. Renovations were in progress on my last visit and I had alerted readers about this fact.Renovations are now complete and I am also glad to say the management has responded positively to several little niggles I had noted previously. First, they are now supplying two bottles of mineral water to the rooms everyday. Second, they now also place black tea bags in the room for those who do not fancy flavored or flowery teas. These features were absent on my previous visits. A further touch was that a sweet lady prepared eggs to my preference at the breakfast cafe; an egg station like this was missing before, although I must add that the lady was not always present to take orders. She was there on the first morning but not the second, and we were back to eating mass prepared scrambled eggs. One little complaint remains at the cafe. There were all kinds of flavored tea there but breakfast tea (black tea) was not available and my attempts to communicate this to a waiter were not fruitful. He simply did not understand what I was asking for and kept offering me the teas that were laid out there.The renovated, rooms while looking fresh and clean, appeared to be smaller than before, possibly because of a slightly different layout. I am talking about rooms facing the court yard from the 14th floor up. I cannot comment on the outer rooms as I did not see their interiors. I found the absence of a work desk particularly disconcerting as I had to use a small stool to accommodate my laptop. This would bother people on business trips more than those on leisure outings, I admit.Perhaps the best (and new) feature was the availability of a smartphone in each room that allows guests to make and receive unlimited local calls and international calls (to a few destinations) completely free of charge. Guests are allowed to carry it out with them when they leave the hotel for meetings or tours. This obviates the need to invest in a local SIM card, particularly for those on short visits.And as always, I enjoyed the lounge on the 14th floor that provides complimentary juices, good teas (including breakfast teas) and cookies to relax after long business meetings. In good weather one can sit out in the adjacent court yard and relax with the drinks and cookies.This hotel is easily accessible from the airports (Narita and Hanneda), is within walking distance of Tokyo tower, and has some famous Japanese shrines located in the vicinity. The staff are friendly and courteous, as always, and when it rained, sturdy umbrellas were provided for our use with compliments of the hotel.Yes, I will continue to be a guest here when I am in Tokyo.","Penang Island, Malaysia","Sunara2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penang Island, Malaysia</strong>",43,4.0

It was a perfect place to stay for a few days, and very reasonably priced.Location: Not bad at all! It's a quiet, mostly residential neighbourhood, and the hotel is exactly half way between two Subway stations, about 20 minutes from Tokyo central railway station. However, just a few minutes walk from the hotel there is a maze of characterful, narrow Japanese streets packed with an amazing array of places to eat. The receptionist gave us a map and pointed this area out to us, and we spent a happy hour exploring it, after eating the best damn bowls of ramen either of us had ever had, and pigging out on gyoza.The hotel isn't too far from the fun, either. We were able to walk back from Ginza (via the seedy lights of Shimbashi) in less than an hour - once it had got dark and the heat had gone from the day.It's also right next to Tokyo Tower, which is a good spot to start sightseeing.The room: Oh, so small!! But, with a couple of tiny closets, and some very imaginative designs making good use of the available space, we were able to make ourselves comfortable. Everything was very clean, the furniture and fittings were in very good condition and seemed quite new, and the bed was totally comfortable. The aircon worked effectively, and - so convenient - a mobile charger with every plug imaginable was provided. It even did USB C.My companion was delighted with the bathroom amenities, especially the bag of lotions and other unguents. She knows about these things, so if she was happy, they were obviously worth having.Food: We only ate in the hotel once, and that was a breakfast buffet. It was pretty nice; good Japanese and western selection, some freshly-prepared dishes, a good choice of food, frequently replenished. Not bad at all!The Lounge: This is the hotel's stand-out feature. On the 14th floor there is a large and well-designed lounge with indoor and outdoor areas, comfy seats for discussing the day's plans, and a big, long table with power sockets for working. There's free soft drinks, iced coffee, juice, and hot tea and coffee from a machine, and you can buy a beer. It's open 24 hours, but only the tea/coffee machine is available out-of-hours. The best thing is that this lounge has a staff member during the day, who is available to help with any queries you might have about things to do, places to go, transport, or anything else - and they WERE helpful, patient, and very good at English.

We switched to this hotel based on the ratings and it was worth it. First of all, the hotel is well located; there are some public transportation stations near so you can move around easily. Also, they offer Handy phones in your room and this is a great feature, in my opinion. The hotel is not very new, but is gorgeous, you can tell they maintain the place spot-on, as you can see in the pictures. The room was spacious and had an amazing view of the Tokyo bay. The A/C was not the best we had, but cooled down the room enough to have a good night sleep. Also, we had breakfast included as a courtesy, because our room had a little problem to begin with (was a small and insignificant thing). Thanks to Hiroshi for personally come to our room and offer an apology. Now that I mentioned the manager, I would like to say something about their staff, by far is the best staff ever during our stay in Japan (consider that our other experiences were nothing but spectacular). From the beginning, the ladies at the front were very nice and helpful, but Abiko was the bomb! She was two steps ahead of us when we had a problem (like forgetting the safe box's combination) or booking our airport limousine. She is the best. We would recommend this hotel any time.

Because of this check-in counter has been moved up to the 14th floor, where the lounge is situated. This is a little inconvenient since you will have to wait for the bus to/from Narita on the ground floor.Apart from that, much was the same as what I experienced before. Two details bothered me, however. First (and I am not sure if this was the case on my previous visits), I found it terribly inconvenient that the hotel does not provide complementary bottles of water in the room. One has to go to a dispenser located on another floor if one wants drinking water. This is quite a surprise since even Two Star hotels in small towns in many countries provide two bottles of drinking water each day, free of charge. Second, both in my room and at the restaurant where breakfast was served, there was green tea and other flavored teas but the simple English breakfast tea was no where to be found.I hope the management can address these little niggles and make the place more comfortable.","Penang Island, Malaysia","Sunara2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penang Island, Malaysia</strong>",43,4.0

They were able to cater to our request and we were delighted, except that my room that gave me, though quite large for a hotel in Tokyo, did not have any view at all as it was facing hotel grounds. So, we made a request to change room with a view of the city skyline. That day was Sunday, and all the rooms were fully occupied, but they told us to pack our belongings when we return to the room that night and they would happily transfer our luggage to another room with a view as soon as it becomes available the following day when we are out sightseeing. They were true to their words. No surcharge or anything.

The lobby is light, airy, and inviting, and my room on the 17th floor was surprisingly spacious for a single. Rooms in Japan can be very small but this one was plenty spacious for one person. The bed was the size of a small double and very comfortable, everything was in good shape, there was sufficient storage, and in the morning, there was a newspaper. Even though I'd booked the room just for one person, there were two shower towels, hand towels etc. Small touches like that make a hotel more than just satisfactory--you feel like they care about their guests and put thought into giving them a good experience. My view was great, it was very quiet, and the free wifi worked reliably. I only had breakfast at the hotel, no other meals, and I recommend the breakfast plate at the Rayon Vert cafe in the lobby. It's good value and good quality with free coffee refills.As to drawbacks, the breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant (Grand Cross, I think) was not impressive with limited selection of mediocre food, and the space seemed cold and impersonal. It's twice the price of the breakfast plate at the much nicer Rayon Vert, so I mostly chose the latter (breakfast was not included in my rate). The only other slight drawback was the location: there was not much immediately in the vicinity of the hotel but a 5-minute walk to the west takes you to a major road with lots of restaurants. There are also several restaurants (including a very nice sushi place) near Mita Station. The hotel is about a four-minute walk from exit 10 of Mita Station, so it's easy to get to anywhere in Tokyo.I enjoyed my stay at Celestine, and I wouldn't mind returning.","Melbourne, Australia","melbguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",163,5.0

But this is not a Vegas style family room or hotel.Service:Very nice staff!There and back again:Take the airport express to any station on Yamanote line or Akasua (?) Line, then to Tamachi or Mita station, and take a walk from there. With heavy baggage, a Taxi from Tokyo Central could be a better option.Value:I found this to be a very good value hotel.

Our first visit to Tokyo so we spent a lot of time trying to find the right hotel - as Tokyo is so big and there are many places to see and things to do.Location - Minato-ku (where the hotel is located) is in a financial area and so it's extremely quiet at night which is fantastic after being in the crowds all day. We arrived in from Kyoto by Shinkansen so came straight into Tokyo station. When you arrive at Tokyo station, jump on the JR Yamanote Line towards Shibuya/Shinjuku and get off at Tamachi. It's then about a 1km (6min) walk to the hotel (which you can do underground via the Mita subway line (exit 8 or 10), or on street level. When you want to travel to other areas of Tokyo that are not close to the Yamanote loop line, there is the Mita subway line as well as the Asakusa subway line within walking distance of the hotel that you can also use. We used these lines to get to the Skytree and to other districts for convenience during our stay.The hotel itself is close to a number of restaurants, the Tokyo tower and also Roppongi. Roppongi is about a 2.5km walk from the hotel and has lots of attractions, bars, restaurants and museums. It's not easy to access via train, so we recommend walking. Tokyo station and Ginza area are also about 3-4kms away, so relatively close.We used our JR pass to use the JR trains (mostly the Yamanote loop line as it was most convenient), and had our ICOCA (IC) card which we purchased in Kyoto and could be used for all JR and subway private lines (and restaurants/convenience stores) that accept SUICA cards (Tokyo equivalent card).Hotel amenities24 hour reception which was good as we had to check out before dawn.Clean room, quiet and spacious for TokyoWe stayed in a standard double (had a queen room) overlooking the city (14th floor), decent bathroom with standard extras, toto toilet and a nice addition is the Japanese beauty sample set. Hotel has free wifi, a lounge that is open to guests 24hrs a day with coffee, tea, water, magazines, computer on level 14. Also two outdoor large patio areas where you can enjoy your beverages.Hotel is in a business building (separate entrance) so starts at level 14. The lobby area has a cafe and there is also a bar and restaurant - we didn't visit these as there were many other options to choose from. The room has two mini bars (fridge and dry products) and a small cupboard with hanging facilities. Only disappointment (and we didn't realise how convenient this was until we started our trip), but being a more upmarket hotel, it doesn't offer self service laundry facilities - only a paid service. This would have been nice to have as we travelled in the middle of summer which made it hard to keep clothes clean for long.Overall, we're very glad we chose this hotel. If you want somewhere to come back to somewhere that's quiet, spacious and away from the crowds, this hotel is for you. If you'd prefer to be in a party/busy district, suggest you choose somewhere else. Tips for guests1. Getting to the airportThe trains start running from Tamachi station at 5am. The first fast train (Keisei private) to Narita airport leaves at 5.58am on weekdays from Ueno and takes 41 minutes. Stops at terminals (2-3) first and then Terminal 1 last. Strongly suggest doing a test run to the Keisei station and buy your tickets in advance so you know where you are going on the day. fastest way is to take the JR Yamanote line towards Tokyo and get off at Ueno. You then need to take the Shibuzan exit from the station and walk to the Keisei station (across the road). There you can catch the airport express.2. Cost of travel on subway and trains.Using your prepaid JR pass is free on Jrtrains, you just need to show it to the station officer at the gates when you come and go.Using the IC card, it cost approximately 130 - 160 to travel on the Yamanote Line and also switching between JR and subway lines.The IC card can be used on both JR and private lines. 3. Getting money outSeven Eleven ATMs are the best and most convenient for taking money out. You need to put your card in before you can choose your language.4. Visiting the Tokyo SkytreeIf you are an international visitor to Japan, you can access the fast track lane to the tower. When you find the desk,they will give you all the instructions. It's about 600 yen more expensive than the normal ticket,but TOTALLY WORTH IT. The normal ticketing system is timed so you may have to wait till your time slot depending on how busy it is on the day. We didn't have to wait long at all and were ushered up straight away. It is a very popular attraction.Things to see and do (highly recommended)Ippudo ramen (various locations)Akihabara (electric town) - on the Yamanote lineGhibli exhibition in Roppongi HillsDay trip to Yokahama (visit the cupnoodles museum and ramen museum and the Nissan headquarters)Ueno park and the Tokyo National MuseumThe imperial palace gardensDominique Ansel Bakery",,Amelia G,75,5.0

It was not the cheapest, but at least the rooms doesn't seem too small (compare my review of the Hong Kong stay at ""Loi Loi Guesthouse"").When we arrived, the room was not yet ready, but that's because we arrived way earlier than the ""check-in"" time.After a quick lunch in the restaurant in the hotel, our room was ready and we could get up.It's was spotless clean and very nice. We also received some vouchers giving us discounts for the breakfast (I will come back to this later).The whole staff was very nice and really helpful.

I was actually good, but I would consider even the discounted price too expensive for what they offer. But that's us and in comparison with the food generally you can get around Tokyo.The Rayon Vert Restaurant at the lobby was fantastic. The price is also right and the food was very tasty. We also visit the bar to get some of the famous Japanese Whiskey. The bartender was very helpful in explaining the differences and so we ended up tasting a couple of them. This was also a nice way to let the day pass and get ready for a good nights sleep.When we left, we ordered an airport shuttle with the hotel. The staff from the lobby was very helpful, organizing everything and talked to the driver. They even served some cereal bars and coffee for the waiting time. Before be went on the bus, they asked us which airline and told us exactly, where to exit the bus (second stop).When visiting Tokyo again, this would be our hotel of choice.","Bremgarten bei Bern, Switzerland","TyN_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bremgarten bei Bern, Switzerland</strong>",74,5.0

Its a 4 minuet walk from Mita station(exit A8 has a lift and A10 has an escalator) which is on the direct Keikyu line from Haneda airport ( we brought the 72 hour welcome card from the Keikyu information kiosk next to the station at the airport with the return trip on the Keikyu line. The Keikyu line train back to airport leaves from the Asakusa line platforms not every train goes to the airport but one leaves about every twelve minuets. The hotel is also a 2 minuet walk to Shibakoen station on the Toei line. Our room had a window nearly the entire length of one wall and a small one on the corner, there was another window in the bathroom above the sink which look directly into a close by office blocks canteen so we didn't open the blind on this one. The view from the main window was of a city scape not to far reaching as there are a large number of higher building about and we were on the 15th floor or though you could climpse the sea between the buildings, there are 2 higher floors so their views might have been better, I don't know but the views from the other side of the hotel might have been better. The room was in good condition except for a couple of small stains on the sofa and 3 cracked floor tiles in the wet room. The shower was very good and the bath was a deep one, I'm 6ft so for me having the raised seat in the bath made for a not to relaxing experience but it didn't bother my 5'2"" wife. Every bathroom item you could desire was there including bath salts a long with a separate toilet. The room was cleaned to a high standard every day and I love that each time we have stayed in Japan PJ's have been supplied, the ones supplied here were longer than any I've had in the past, they are just ideal for relaxing around the room when your just chilling, bathrobes and slippers were supplied to but I never use the bathrobes in any hotel just because I never use one at home I guess. The area around the hotel is a business district but there are 'Lawson' and 'Eleven' convenience stores all around with a lot of restaurants of different types in the streets behind Mita station and if you walk towards Hamamatsucho JR station (where the monorail stops from Haneda) you'll pass many restaurants and if you really need a MacDonalds or a Starbucks or a Mos burger you'll find them to also just roud the corner from the hotel is a place called Jonathan's which from the outside doesn't look to appealing but its modern light and clean with a mix of Japanese and European foods. Try the Bracken starch pudding (yes made from the roots of the bracken weed) its different or even the snow crab and fresh seaweed salad, its not always Sushi, ramen or Soba. There is a good BBQ place other side of JR Tamachi station (convenient for the Yamanote loop line) on the 4th floor of one of the building as you come back down to street level. All the staff at the hotel were charming and very polite which of coarse is the way in Japan.

But again, it's common for Japanese hotel. We manage to cosleep with my 6yo in one bed.. I love the neighborhood because it's quite, yet it has all the basic needs. 7-11 convinient store is at the back of the hotel lobby, then Lawson is only 2 minutes away, Tullys coffee also steps away from lobby.I honestly prefer to stay in this area than Shinjuku , too busy at night for me.The staffs are very friendly during check in, they speak adequate English and the check in was fast. Their free wifi also good. Around 7 minutes walking from hotel is the Mita Station (metro) and 12-15 minutes walk from hotel is a JR station - Tamachi, which both make all the trip to explore Tokyo easy. You might take a little time to learn about the map of JR and Metro since they are very extensive lines But practically u can go anywhere in Tokyo thru those trains. Love itEateries can be found around 5-7 minutes walk from hotel, they have good choices from ramen to Japanese BBQ, we had a good experience since we love Japanese food. Never had a bad experience with food in Tokyo, literally.

On my floor there was a really nice lounge and courtyard area to relax in, but when your in Tokyo, it's unlikely you will spend too much time there.I didn't eat here, so I can't comment one way or another.This brings us to the cons, which really is location. Yes, it's very close to Toei Oedo and Mita Lines, but about 8 - 10 minute walk from Tamachi Station (JR) which is more convenient than the other Toei lines... If I could save a significant amount of money, I'd very happily stay here, but if I could find a hotel that was 8-10 minute walk (or less) from a more convenient station for close to the same price, it would be hard for me to return here as I value location more than most aspects of hotels while traveling in Tokyo.",Cary,"JapanPhotoGuide</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cary</strong>",11,4.0

The hotel is a 5-10 min walk from the Mita Subway station and Tamachi JR railway station. This was suuuuper convenient.

In Europe this would easily be a 4-star hotel, so this was a fantastic deal at $125 a night (including breakfast--which had dozens of offerings including Japanese and American/European food, all of which were fantastic). My room was on the 16th floor, which had a good view of the city. The room was small, but extremely clean, and it included a refrigerator, mini-bar, and snacks. The queen bed was excellent, and it included feather pillows, which added to the comfort. The room included a private shower with completely modern fixtures as well as a fancy Japanese toilet with all the cleaning options you could desire. The room also had highly effective room darkening curtains, which helped because the sun rises in this land of the rising sun around 4:15 am this time of year (late June on my visit). The climate control in the room worked perfectly.On the 14th floor there is a spacious lounge with a browsing library, comfortable chairs, sofas, an espresso/coffee machine that grinds its own beans, and a mineral water dispenser. There is a nice courtyard outside should you like to take your coffee in the open air. The machine produced decent coffee, though not great, but I was overjoyed to have this option because with my jet lag I was up about 4:00 am each morning and needed a cup before breakfast, which starts at 7:00 am. The staff who work for the hotel are exceedingly polite and attentive. The lobby is elegant and spacious, and the hotel is just a block away from the Mita metro station, which I found convenient. The hotel is also close to areas with a multitude of restaurants. The only reason I gave this a ""very good"" rather than an excellent is because there is no exercise facility. After all my walking and sightseeing, I suppose there was not really a need, but I did miss lifting weights and stretching during my week stay at this otherwise wonderful hotel. I also wish the hotel dinner dining and bar were a bit more reasonably priced. If they were, I might have tried them. With prices quadruple what I could find a block away, there wasn't a chance I was staying in, even on one of the rainy nights during my stay.

We stayed in a superior double room which was 21 sq-meter in size. The room felt quite big. The room was extremely clean and the beds were very comfortable. There was a small sofa and coffee table, as well as a desk and chair.The bathroom was a good size with a nice bathtub and shower. The water pressure and temperature were great.I have to say that when we first entered the hotel lobby, our first reaction was ""wow!"". The lobby is gorgeous and you really feel like you are staying in a high end hotel. The front desk staff are extremely helpful and very pleasant. We were waiting outside one day for a friend to pick us up. The front desk staff noticed us standing there and quickly came outside to ask if we were in need of a taxi.We usually used the Tamachi Station (which is on the Yamamote line), and is approximately a 10 minute walk away.I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

To top that off the flyers come in many languages, japanese, English, Korean, even French!We went for the room that is next one up on the cheapest and it was nicely sized for a Tokyo hotel. Includes pretty much any amenity you will need in a hotel, from cleaning lotions, to shavers, fresh daily towels, hair dryer, wardrobe with hangers and a safe, even a plug adapter so you can use the European 3 pins! The only draw back was that the fridge was not cool at all it was barely chilling our cold drinks.

The price, and quality of a large hotel room in Tokyo is something of a precious commodity it seems and Celestine nicely fills the gap with large, clean rooms at reasonable prices by Tokyo standards. Part of this has to do with the location of the hotel: it's not in a ""stylish"" tourist area as you're basically in-between a bunch of office buildings in a business district that is extremely QUIET on weekends. However, that should by no means deter you from staying here as it is perhaps one of the more accessible hotels in Tokyo: 1) The hotel is a stop on one of the Narita Airport Limo bus lines, and it's basically 30 minutes by train to Haneda airport or a quick car ride. 2) You're a short walk and one subway stop from Shinagawa Station which is great if you are taking the Shinkansen to southern prefectures like Osaka and Kyoto3) You're wedged in-between two subway stations on one of the main subway lines in Tokyo4) There's a bus stop not too far away that can get you to Roppongi Hills in under 20 minutes5) Walking distance to Tokyo Tower, a main tourist attraction. Quick 10 minute taxi ride to Tsukiji fish market if you choose to rise early for the breakfast sushi or the tuna auction. Upon arrival to the hotel, check-in was quick and efficient. The whole hotel is non-smoking which is AWESOME. Our room was on the side that faced Tokyo harbor and we had a semi-obstructed view of the bridge which was nice. The room was clean and SPACIOUS and nicely appointed. In fact, it was quite large for Tokyo standards. The lobby of the hotel gives off the impression the hotel is a bit dated but the rooms and corridors are anything but that. Service here is good but can be a bit robotic at times. We didn't try the food here and were hardly in the room but we were all around happy with this property and would easily stay here again.The only thing that could be improved upon was the bathrooms: the water pressure in the shower was a bit low.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The subway line is only 1 block away and a cheap way to get to anywhere in Tokyo. We elected to take the bus from the airport so as not to have luggage on the subway. The bus is only 3100 JPY (or $25 USD) and takes about 90 minutes with no transfers so is the easiest and cheapest way to get there. You can buy your tickets at the bus counter right outside of customs and baggage claim before exiting the airport. The breakfast at the open restaurant in the lobby was simple and inexpensive (only $8 USD) and was a nice start to the day. I think the room was a little pricey, but it was a holiday which explains the increase. All in all I would recommend this hotel as long as you are ok taking transportation to most sites....Tokyo Tower was within walking distance, and Ginzu was a far walk...everything else you would need to get a taxi or take the subway. A taxi was about 1100 JPY (or $9USD) to Rappongi Hills.","Richmond, Virginia","FrequentTravels3071</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",21,5.0

Still it was the little touch like this that warmed my heart. If you're planning a stay at the Celestine, it's recommended that you make your reservations early. I understand that the hotel is only on a couple of floors. So rooms get snapped up really quickly. I stayed in the superior double room which was perfect for me. It wasn't small and it had all that I needed there. I loved especially that the wireless internet was free, high speed and smooth. The breakfast buffet in the morning serves up a good quality spread which I believe cater to international travelers well. In terms of convenience, you get Mita station about 5 mins away from the hotel, Tamachi station around 7 to 10mins walk, and if you need your necessities, no problem, there's a convenience store that's just 5 mins walk away. I do however wish the hotel had more restaurants around its vicinity or at least provide a good free flow of mineral water bottles in the room (in my case, you need to go to the convenience store to buy).

Both metro and JR station are within close reach and the hotel is 5-10 minutes taxi ride from Shinagawa train station or 5 min taxi ride from Haneda monorail station giving easy access to both NRT and HND airports. Nearby the hotel there is a very interesting area (small alleys) with loads of eateries and izakaya bars where you can watch every evening the salary men drinking themselves dead. :))Also, do not miss Zojoji temple nearby with mighty Tokyo tower behind it. The hotel itself is very cosy though you can tell from the furniture that it is not brand new, but still very clean and functional with good sound proofing. The standard room can be a bit on the small size but in case you need a roomier space they have other room options for higher prices.

The partial view of the Rainbow Bridge from the room was great, once you get over the office building right in front of the window. I used the free lounge on the 14th floor frequently (open 24 hours) because there was a nice espresso machine. It'd be great if English newspapers and magazines can be provided in the lounge in addition to the Japanese ones, since this is an international business hotel visited by a lot of foreigners. The lounge came with a cozy outdoors terrace area and the only complaint I have is the virtual separation of smoking and non smoking areas on opposite ends of the lounge which really didn't work when there was more than one person smoking.

I was of course curious as to whether they have maintained their standards. I can say that they have and clearly more foreigners have become aware of the value offered by the hotel. If you do book at the Celestine, make sure you fly into Haneda Airport which is closer to the city and not as large as Narita. If you do, getting to the hotel is cheap and quick. Take the monorail, which is a one minute walk once you leave customs, to the end of the line (Hamamatsucho). Trains leave frequently but all trains travel to the same end point. Once at Hamamatsucho, take the JR line one stop to Tamachi station. Total cost was 630 Yen. From the station it is approximately a seven minute walk to the hotel. It took me all of 35 minutes from start to finish. If you simply are loaded down with luggage you can take an airport bus (infrequent) or grab a cab from Hamamatsucho station.The lobby is on the ground floor of an office building with the rooms on the 14th-17th. Be advised that they won't let you check in early. The staff is helpful and all speak serviceable English. The double rooms are comfortable by Tokyo standards. This means small but not tiny as they are in Tokyo hotels of a similar class. The cable TV has some 4 or 5 English language stations for those not fluent in Japanese. Wifi is free and available in the room. The room also comes equipped with an all purpose plug adapter which saved me when I forgot to bring my own. However the best place to work is on the large 14th floor lounge (free wifi) that offers free coffee, tea, mineral water and cookies. There is a garden surrounding the lounge with table where you can enjoy a meal purchased outside the restaurant. The area itself is far from exciting but the subway line is a mere 2 minute walk away as well as the JR line just a 7 minute walk. So it is easy to travel to anywhere in Tokyo. The area also has a web of small, inexpensive restaurants located between the station and Keio University, a short 5 minute walk.

Our room was a bit smaller than expected, but very clean and with all of the usual amenities. The bathroom had fine Grohe fixtures and the beds were firm and comfortable. The buckwheat pillows available on request are worth getting. The lounge on the 14th floor is an unexpected delight, with books, magazines, free coffee and tea, and a very pleasant atmosphere. There are open patios on either side (smoking and non-smoking) of the lounge that are well protected from the wind (but not rain). Our room was very very quiet - no internal noise from other guests, elevator, etc. and no street noise at all until the work morning was well under way (and even then it was very quiet). Our view included one end of the Rainbow Bridge and the break room at the bank next door. The large picture window in the room provided a lot of natural light. The nearest subway stops are Mita and Shibakoen, both about two very easy blocks away, with Akabenabashi just a few blocks further. It is very easy to get anywhere in Tokyo as these stops are on the Mita and Oedo Lines, which run all around and through the city. At most, you will need to transfer only once to get to just about any location served by the subway or train systems. The buffet in the Grand Cross restaurant was very good, with plenty of Japanese and Western breakfast choices. The hotel and restaurant staff were pleasant and professional. It was easy to get to the Celestine by Keikyu train directly to Mita from Haneda late at night (we landed at around 10 from SFO and made it to the hotel by around 11:30) - the Keikyu trains do not all run directly to Mita and it is necessary to check the maps and information to get the right train. Otherwise it will be necessary to transfer at Sengakuji to the Asakusa line, if I have my info right.

We prefer a quiet home base to return to, an easy way to get there (2 subway stations nearby), and a smattering of liveliness within walking distance (Tokyo tower and a ""restaurant row"" within a couple of street blocks). Once inside the hotel, you will immediately see the hotel is modern, updated and impeccably clean. Perhaps it wasn't the right time of the year (Octobor), but we didn't come across any kids in the hotel -- the clientele seemed primarily to consist of businessmen and some tourists. This is a big plus for those who appreciate tranquility, as we do.The hotel rooms, while small (but not by Tokyo standards), are clean and updated. We didn't see faded carpets or dinged up furniture that you sometimes get in older, bigger hotels that rely on their brand recognition. The AC/thermostat was modern (giving you the ability to set the temperature once and forget about it), and the hotel includes fast wifi on the premises.The front desk reception / concierge staff was very helpful with excellent English skills and they helped us with all sorts of requests, from locating a laundromat to finding a good shabu shabu restaurant. The one service oddity we experienced was when we asked for help finding something to eat late our first night in, the front desk staff didn't tell us there was a street consisting of probably 30-50 restaurants just a couple of blocks away and instead directed us to a place about 20 minutes away with only 3-5 choices (mostly izakaya with terrible food).. we had to discover the restaurant area on our own a couple of days later.The gem of our stay which we really enjoyed was the hotel lounge, which I believe is on the 14th floor. It consists of a beautiful and large ""living room"" like the kind you might expect in a boutique ski resort -- this was the perfect place to bring a newspaper or laptop and catch up on email or read the daily news. They have a nice coffee machine there that makes good cappuccino/expresso (free). Immediately outside this lounge was a large outdoor patio area that I found to be ideal for smoking my cigars and getting in the vacation mood.In all, we enjoyed the hotel's cleanliness, excellent service, convenient and safe location, and the surprisingly enjoyable lounge.

I wanted a room that was a decent size as there were two of us in the room (and Japanese hotel rooms are notoriously small) and it certainly was a good size for Japan and the bathroom was a good size as well - with a nice long bench to put toiletries. Some of the good features in the bathroom were a nice bath (shower over the bath), very large size shampoos/conditioners etc and they also had a very well-stocked amenity box with everything you could want. The only thing that wasn't ideal were the very thin towels which were scratchy - not sure why they skimped on the towels. The room had a comfortable bed, dressing gowns were provided and there were also a couple of sofa chairs, a reasonable sized desk, wardrobe and safe plus tea/coffee making facilities. There was no iron and ironing board but that was brought up to the room very quickly when ordered.The hotel has a nice lobby with a cafe in it. The Celestine Hotel is in a business area (a block from NEC headquarters) but there isn't too much around the area. However within the same building as the hotel there are several restaurants and we went to the Italian restaurant Pagliacci Due which was great! There is also a Tully's coffee shop (great coffee) within the building as well so it's convenient if you want a restaurants close by. Also the Shibakoen train station (on the Toei Mita line) is just a couple of minutes walk away and you can get anywhere in Tokyo once on the subway system. There are other stations also nearby but Shibakoen is the closest. Also staff are great at the hotel and their English skills are generally pretty goodInternet is free in the rooms (but you can upgrade to a higher speed if you want but this wasn't necessary for normal business usage). TV in the rooms has BBC and CNN so a couple of English channels. Our package didn't include breakfast but they did provide a discount off the breakfast but we still had to pay 1500 yen each person. The breakfast was OK but the buffet doesn't change from day to day so you'd probably get pretty sick of it after a few days but all the basics are provided. There is also a guest lounge that is available to all guests but we were busy and didn't get to use it!As a business hotel, it was ideal and we would stay there again. We booked the hotel directly (as it was the same price as my usual booking site for Asia, Agoda). Beware of the very strange entry on your credit card - the name of the hotel appeared as gobbledygook (so I'm guessing it was in Japanese) but the location says France (I guess it's a French owned hotel) - it took a while to figure out it was the hotel charge on my card! I paid about US160 per night inc. all taxes and service fees for a Deluxe Double. The Celestine Hotel enjoys a good reputation in Japan so I think overall it was one of the better places we've stayed and I consider it very good value for money.","Cromwell, New Zealand","MVW-NZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cromwell, New Zealand</strong>",148,4.0

Internet is included which is now something I watch for on every stay - it should be free. There is a charge if you want step up to high speed internet - but that's seems only necessary if you plan to download movies or large amounts of streaming data. We were very happy with the rate of the free wireless internet for all email and even uploading photos to Facebook.The breakfast charges are very confusing. On-line when booking direct it says ""breakfast included"" but when you check-in they give you a ""discount voucher"" for 1500 yen. When you go to use them you find is is not really 1500 yen off the breakfast but the voucher gives you a discount from full breakfast price of 2100 yen to 1500 yen! So what we thought was breakfast included still cost us 3000 yen each morning for two of us. And the breakfast was very basic - rather poor selection and very budget hotel in buffet presentation. Trying to get an explanation of the breakfast charges compared to the ""breakfast included"" booking from the front desk at check-out was impossible, so we just figured it out ourselves, paid and accepted it.

The views from the hotel room were really nice and the room was good size and very clean. I also enjoyed the selection of amenities in the room. I would have preferred if it had a small gym or an agreement with some local gym. Even so, I would not hesitate in staying there if I am lucky enough to visit Tokyo again. Very close to the hotel (close to Keio University) there are many nice places to eat out. It is also worth mentioning that the hotel is in a business building, where there is also a sushi house, a pizzeria and a Chinese restaurant.On my last day, I had a traditional green tea with a very nice Japanese sweet in the pastisserie in the lobby.

You can know that the staffs and the citizens of Tokyo are polite and their service came from their heart.Rooms were a bit small for standard room, however it was clean and homely. We were pleasantly surprised on one of our days where we left our messy room and came back to a VERY NEAT AND TIDY room where our toiletries, make ups and other beauty products were arrange neatly in heights and sizes. This hotel is located slightly away from the busy and colourful areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya so its quiet and peaceful at night. But its less than 5 minutes walk from Mita station. If you like to party, a 10-15mins taxi ride to Roppongi's night life cost less than US15 (taxis in tokyo are very expensive.)If there was one small thing the hotel was missing is definitely a swimming pool. I personally like to take a dip in every hotel's swimming pool when i am on vacation.

I have had rooms on both the city and bay side of the hotel, and both have great views. Another hotel perk is the 14th floor lounge that has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor lounge area is Spanish-feeling - it has several tables and chairs in a beautiful setting with Spanish tile. The lounge has coffee and tea available most of the day.The breakfast seems to be priced differently depending on your room rate (it is typically not included in the room rate). My breakfast price was 1500 yen, and it was well worth it. It has Japanese breakfast items including fish which is different every day, salad with a variety of dressings, and noodles and vegetables, American/Western breakfast items (pastries and bread, eggs and bacon) and fruit, yogurt, cereals, juices and coffee.The service is excellent here - staff are very friendly and helpful.

I had to travel to Tokyo with a mind to keep costs under control so was forced away from the usual 4/5* or quaint/boutique/design hotels I try to stay in usually when I travel. I found Celestine through doing a bit of research online and thought I'd give it a go. Given the low price relative to competition, I had some concerns that it would not be great, even with all the good tripadvisor reviews. I was delighted to be proven wrong!I got the Superior Double Room, which is one of their smaller doubles. The room is indeed small, but not uncomfortably so - there is a good sized king bed, a desk with just about enough space to work and they have even managed to include a small sofa and coffee table. Wardrobe space is limited, so perhaps not the best place for an extended stay. I was impressed with the finish of the room. The hotel has clearly been recently renovated and everything looks pristine and modern. Also impressed with the attention to detail, for example in providing bathrobes and an excellent selection of toiletries, useful to a light-traveler like myself with carry-on bags only. As an added bonus, the hotel has a 24-hour convenience store at the back that sells drinks, light snacks etc. Last but in no way least, all the staff speak perfect English and are very nice and helpful.The downside? The area is not the most happening and you'll need to take public transport in the day and some taxis to get back home late at night and the latter will add to the total bill. Still, the price difference from anything remotely similar in, say, Roppongi, will more than offset this outlay. The hotel would also benefit a lot if management could strike a deal with a nearby gym for guest use. Finally, it would be great if in addition to the Japanese channels the TV had a few international ones, if only news-channels to keep up to date with what is happening. If the latter two points were addressed, this place would get 5 out of 5 for me.",London,"Kermit_UK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",26,4.0

It is located a block away from the Shibakoen metro stop, two blocks to the Mita metro stop, and just a 5 minute further walk to the Tamachi JR (Yamanote) line. The convenience of these three transit options can pretty much get you anywhere within the metro area easily. If arriving from the airport via Narita Express, reserve your seat to get off at Shinagawa, then back-track one stop to Tamachi on the elevated JR Yamanote line (much easier than transfering at the larger, and more confusing, Tokyo station).The lower half of the building is occoupied by offices so the ground floor is divided into an office entrance lobby and the hotel entrance lobby. For a smallish hotel, the lobby is quite large, with two story windows, a coffee/chocolate shop, and a fully attentive staff available 24/7.Hotel rooms are located on floors 14-17. 95% of the rooms face the outside, but 8-10 rooms per floor face an interior courtyard. Rooms facing north and south are much larger, but face other buildings and offer obstructed views. Rooms facing east and west are incredibly small, but provide nice city views. I've been to the hotel twice (2006 and 2011). The first time we had a larger south facing room that was comfortable, but had limited skyline views. Last week we had a west facing room. It is probably one of the tiniest hotel rooms you'll find anywhere, but we were rewarded with two rare mornings where the ever-present haze lifted and we could see Mount Fuji in the distance behind the skyline.Fortunately, they've done everything they could to maximize the tiny space. We had a queen size bed with two wall mounted end tables (barely enough room for an alarm clock and glass of water), a wall mounted desk/mini-bar/TV stand combination, a small, two-person seat that barely fit between the end table and windows, and a small coffee table that could fit a laptop and magazine side-by-side.Near the entry door is a built-in closet/dresser that is so narrow that the hanging rod goes toward you instead of parallel to the wall. We had to double (and triple) up clothes on hangers in layer (pants first, then two shirts on top of them). There are similarly narrow drawers next to it (one wastefully taken up by mini-bar candies and snacks). Although the walkable area of the bathroom was tiny, it did provide lots of counter space and a spacious bath tub. This room provided nice features like a steam-proof section of mirror over the sink and a Toto toilet (the typical Japanese kind with bidet functions and heated seats).The decorations are contemporary and clean in the rooms and in the common areas.There is no gym or pool, but the 14th floor does offer a lounge with complimentary water, coffee, and tea all day long, and some outdoor seating in the courtyard. Don't expect views, though...it's an interior courtyard with 4+ floors of hotel rooms completely surrounding it. We did find it a pleasant space to sit at night, though. Even more surprising, we saw stars despite being in one of the brightest and most crowded cities on earth.The Celestine also has a first floor restaurant called Grand Cross that offers breakfast for about 2,000 yen (currently the equivalent of about $26.00 US). Some room mates include the breakfast and you'll get meal tickets for each morning.As with the hotel lobby staff, the crew here is very attentive. I must admit I find the food options hilarious. In an attempt to accomodate all nationalities, the buffet stations have the standard eggs, bacon, yogurt, fruit, cereal and toast...but also spaghetti, broccolli, hot dogs, tater tots and a few Japanase items (rice, miso soup, tofu). I remind you...these are items served from 7am - 9:30am for breakfast!I found $26 a bit steep so I made the most out of breakfast by going closer to 9:30, eating heartily, then having a smaller lunch later on.The office side of the ground floor also has a restaurant (Itlaian) and, I believe a small Japanese restaurant and a Tully's Coffee Shop.Again, the staff here are incredibly attentive and friendly. At all times, you will find at least 4 or 5 people in the lobby...often rushing to push the button on the elevator for you. They'll gladly loan you an umbrella if it's looking like rain (which is common in Tokyo). One funny side story...my husband is allergic to feather pillows so on our third morning he went to the lobby to request a non-feather pillow. That evening we returned to the room to find two new pillows that were hard as a rock. It felt like clay....you'd get the pillow into position then it would never move. Being the curious type, I inspected further by removing the pillow case and unzipping the pillow. What we found was straw. Not the stuff horses eat, but drinking straws cut into thousands of 1/4 inch pieces.Anyway, this was my second time at the Celestine and I'd definitely stay there again. My husband has probably been there dozens of times on various business trips, too. Neither of us has had a bad experience. The small east and west facing rooms are definitely more comfortable for one person versus two people, but our west-facing view this time was quite spectacular by day and night (we could see Shinjuku and Mount Fuji). But if you're used to western standard room sizes, you may be more comfortable facing south...especially if you'll be staying for more than a few nights.","Cambridge, Massachusetts","snarl71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",151,4.0

The public rooms are all well presented and outfitted with the amenities you would expect. The price is quite good for downtown Tokyo. The room is normal size for Tokyo, which is small. It really ticked all the boxes and was on its way to getting a fairly spectacular review if it weren't for two little problems that I view as extremely significant....1. The massive cockroach that took over my bathroom and 2. the woman with a severe attitude that checked me out.The cockroach: To be fair, the cockroach probably thought I was gone for the day. I had returned from an early morning meeting and went back up to my room to get ready for the next meeting. Stuck my room card into the slot next to the door to turn on the lights, threw open the bathroom door and turned on the light and there was the biggest cockroach I have ever seen sitting in front of the toilet, and it looked like he was looking at me. I actually had to lean in and wave at him to get him to scurry off. I went back down and asked the people at the reception, quite discreetly, to remove the monster insect from my bathroom. No apologies from the staff just a nod. The next day my colleague changed his room after he had a mini-stampede of two cockroaches running across the desk while he was working on his computer.2. The woman who checked me out: For the management team: It was Saturday September 4th, it was about 6:15 am and the lady who checked me out was working the far right station (when facing the checkout desk). Unfriendly is an understatement - totally different to the rest of the staff that I encountered, all of whom were professional and friendly. Anyway, she did give me my airport bus ticket, but ""forgot"" to give me my luggage tags - which I didn't know I needed, but I'm guessing she did. When the bus driver refused to load my bag due to missing tags, I ran back in to the hotel and she put up a hand ""Please wait"". Sorry but the bus was leaving. Fortunately somebody els from the desk staff helped me out and I was able to catch the bus.Other than the cockroach problem that this hotel seems to have, It is a very good hotel. I'm not sure how much they can do about the problem - it's not my field of expertise. All I can say is that this is the first ""nice"" hotel that I've ever stayed at with this problem and it is a bit disconcerting.",Germany,"MrktMgr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Germany</strong>",45,2.0

The availability of the free-to-use safe was welcome.

My visits have lasted from three days to eight days. My first stay there was shortly after they opened, and I can say that the quality of rooms, service and breakfast has not faltered at all. It is a simple, low-key hotel by Tokyo standards, which I appreciate -- there are not lots of people bowing as you enter, running to the elevator to push the button for you. Instead it has an under-stated, professional and cordial staff, ready to help in any way possible. I enjoy the buffet breakfast, which offers both western and Japanese choices. There is no reason to eat lunch or dinner in the hotel.I have stayed at many hotels in Tokyo, and this is by far the quietest. In fact, I have never heard any noise from the rooms, which are located on the top floors of an office building. The location may seem a bit out of the way, but as a previous reviewer wrote, it is a five minute walk to the Mita Subway Station and only a few minutes further to the Tamachi JR Station, so you can get anywhere in Tokyo very quickly, then return to the peace and quiet of the Celestine. The rooms are a good size for Japan, and very comfortable. I should warn you that the mattresses are very firm, but you will find this nearly everywhere in the country (historically, their standard is a futon on the floor). You will have everything you need -- television with CNN and BBC, high speed internet access, and robes, towels and toiletries replaced daily.My only complaint is that it is a long ride on the Limousine Bus to and from the airport, because there are a number of other stops, which are not necessarily on the way. You can take the Narita Express train to Shinagawa Station, which is not far from the Celestine, then take a taxi to the hotel, but this is inconvenient with luggage.

The hotel is located in the Shiba area, right next to the NEC building and close to the Tokyo Tower. It is clean, and modern, and the reception staff are polite and fluent in English. The rooms are located on the upper three floors of the building, and the reception is on the ground floor. The hotel is clearly intended for business travellers, though it is also suitable for tourists given its central location. However, families with children will definitely feel out of place and would probably be better served elsewhere. The rooms are on the small side, but reasonably sized for central Tokyo, and they are fully featured, e.g. minibar, bath, safe, cable TV, and free Internet. There is a dining/bar area, and free drinks are provided in the reception area. The hotel is quiet inside, and the rooms are secure and kept immaculately clean. The area immediately surrounding the hotel is mainly business establishments and is perfectly safe to walk around after dark. If you walk a short way towards the nearby university you will find a range of shops and a selection of excellent restaurants. The hotel is around 5 minutes walk from the Tamachi JR station (Yamanote line), and is also very close to the Mita subway station (Mita and Asakusa lines). These stations allow you direct access all of the important areas in central Tokyo, e.g. Shinagawa, Ginza, Asakusa, and Ueno. To reach the hotel from the main Airport (Narita) you will want to take the airport train service to Tokyo station, and then the JR line to Tamachi station - this takes around 1.5 hours so you will need to leave plenty of time. To reach the hotel from the domestic airport (Haneda), you take the monorail to Hamamatsucho station and then the JR line for one stop to Tamachi station - this takes around a half hour. Do not take a taxi to/from the airport unless you are willing to spend a lot of money! In summary, this is an excellent hotel in central Tokyo that is geared primarily towards western business travellers. It is well connected to the transport system, and my stay there was pleasant and problem free.","Seattle, Washington","cwalton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",79,5.0
