In 63 years I have had some bad experiences but none that top this one. When i rented it I did not realize it was a condo. I found it hard to locate and there wasNo one available to reach out to ask any questions. If you get a rental car plan to pay for parking. When the elevator does work it takes forever to get to you. The first night i stayed they shut the elevator down for the entire weekend and i Had to carry my luggage up and down to the 24th floor the entire time. Again no one on premises to reach out to. Once i got in the room the blankets and sheets were dirty...The AC didn't work... The TV didn't work... The Wifi didn't work... The window shades wouldn't pull down...The Windows allowed air to pass through creating a whistle sound the whole night and again no one available to get anything working. They will take your money and from there your on your own. I wouldn't recommend this dump to my worst enemy. BUYER BEWARE!!!,,JamesValasco,1,1.0

When I booked online it was for room 2804. When we arrived we ended up in room 3504. I’ve attached photos. This place is a dump. We had stained towels, blood stains on the mattress, broken cupboards and filthy cutlery. For the first week the elevator worked then they turned it off due to high winds. Ironically the hotel in front of ours still has all of theirs running. Being on the 35th floor with bad knees and ankles and a partner who bodyboards climbing 35 floors was horrifying. It completely destroyed our holiday as our first trip to Hawaii and our first holiday as a couple. If you book this place your nuts!!!

It would appear that the New Year is prime time to visit Hawaii. After searching TripAdvisor, I came across this place. I read reviews, good and bad, with the main complaint being the elevator. So, reluctantly, I booked it for the one night (not to mention, our $300+ price was cheaper than the almost $1000 price for other places - and there weren't that many choices). First, there is no early check in, even though instructions said you could ask. So, precisely at 4pm, we got in to our room. The TV was on (we figured that was because the remote didn't work most of the time). As I entered the door to the room, I noticed a cabinet door ajar. I went to shut it to keep from hitting my head upon entering. It was open because it wouldn't stay closed. Once we got in to the room, I put one of our bags on the bed. I've seen trampolines with less bounce. And throughout the night, every time one of us moved, it almost launched the other one. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. While looking the place over, I noticed the faucet in the shower leaked. Also, the first time we washed our hands in the bathroom sink, it became apparently clear that it was clogged. It took hours to drain. Also, when I went to throw something away, I discovered the cabinet door hiding the trash can in the ""kitchenette"" was loose and almost fell off (it was being held by one hinge). As for the elevator, I do believe I read reviews from a couple of years back with guests complaining about the elevator ( just how long doesn't take to fix an elevator?). When we checked in, there was one of the two elevators working, so, yes, we had a long wait. Thankfully, we had to leave before sunrise, so the elevator wasn't too much of a problem. Also, since we did leave before sunrise, we discovered that there are no lights in the tight, small parking garage, so you might want to make sure you have a flashlight. We stayed here because there were few choices, but I wonder if we would have been just as comfortable sleeping in our Jeep.

I am considering filling a formal complaint with the consumer protection of the state of Hawaii.Here are some of the main issues we encountered:Sheets, pillow cases, and towels were all heavily stained. I found nail clippings and hair on the sheet. Even the fridge had not been emptied! The toilet bowl was very dirty. The shower was moldy, and the shower drain was clogged.I sent the same pictures I have accompanied with this review in an email and also a few text messages to their management, but have not received any response yet (a week after we checked out). We ended up calling them to just get clean sheets and towels.We happened to be in the unit when someone finally showed up to replace the stained sheets and towels. The person struggled with finding clean sheets: He went through four sheets until he finally found a clean one. Even he himself was surprised!We had not been told about the situation with the elevator (45 minute wait time as in the notice in one of the images). The building has two elevators and for a period during our stay both were down. We had to take the stairs. The unit we stayed at was on the 29th floor.The broken door handles of the microwave and the fridge, and the use of two twin mattresses instead of a queen or king mattress (see the images) indicate how poorly maintained this place is.

I return to the building to go up and get dressed and on the way up- alone-(because Im fancy like that and had my own private elevator- aka no one else was dumb enough to get on said elevator) the elevator stopped. On the 30th floor. after 15 minutes of crying screaming for help -sweating off the miracle make up job some poor lady did to my face...the lights go out and the elevator slips down a few feet so im now stuck staring at the all between the 29thand 30th floors. I have never had anxiety or a panic attack of any sort since Prince died and im afraid that evening i did. That or I just peed my pants- who knows.People were trying to help, no one could get the doors open but the fire department came and after 40 minutes and six firemen later(SIX firemen, ladies. you read that right) they were able to wedge the door open so i could be pulled out. Ive never wanted to grab a fireman so badly. or have I. But my boyfriend was there and naturally my first option for an ab grab. I hate to leave a bad review as the owner of the condo is wonderful, but I had to walk up and down 36 flights of stairs the remainder of our trip anytime I came and went, which I am sure sounds like a dream if you're a CrossFit junkie which I am not. plus side i now have a butt the Kardashians would envy and I slept like a baby on the red eye home which made for a quiet and relaxing return flight for the boyfriend.",,MissMary122882,0,2.0

We had prepaid this room and as they have no check in counter (not suprised as they would have a constant line up of people complaining) we had to check in on line. The following day we noticed that there had been approx 5 seperate chargers on my friends credit card from Marina Towers totalling over $1000. They are theives. We got our travel agent to try and sort this out and two weeks later we still are waiting to receive the full amount back as promised. When we arrived to the room on the 39th floor in the shaky glass elevator that only one of two were working we were so gutted to see the room was filth. The toilet hadn't been cleaned, there was hardly any toilet paper left on the roll, the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. Soap scum and mould everywhere.. The kitchen was a disgrace. The sheets were stained and the pillows were completely yellow . We had to arrange to have the room cleaned the following day. I've stayed in some older, basic hotels before but this was next level. We were then told that maybe our expectations were too high. Not sure that having a room cleaned before arrival is much of an expectation. We wore our shoes the whole time as we were scared to walk on the carpet, the lounge chair was also heavily stained. I was really looking forward to staying in Waikiki as it was my first time to Hawaii and this experience really ruined it for me. Since being home I have searched around and there are so many other options of places to stay for the same money we wasted on this place. So disappointed.

I wish I had of read the reviews because I can tell you, they’re all true, it’s an awful place to stay and very very unorganised. From the moment we arrived we had problems. Had to wait 4 hours before being let into our room even after emailing the hotel a week prior to our stay that we would be arriving at 8am and would like to check in early or at least drop our bags. There was nobody in sight and when I called the number for the hotel nobody answered. We luckily found a cleaner who stored our bags away for us and then we went for a walk to the nearby shopping centre and had to kill a few hours after our 11 hour flight. Finally, we got into our room... I don’t think it has been updated since first being built, tiles were lifting, the carpet was heavily stained, bathroom was disgusting and the light in there did not work. If you want to take the elevator to your room. Depending on what floor you’re staying on, it could take up to 40 mins to get there as only 1 elevator is in operation for the 40 odd floors. During the middle of our stay, even that elevator broke down and we had to walk up 15 levels each time to get to and from our hotelWhen we checked out, we got to the airport and realised we had left our vape (e-cigarette) in our room. So I quickly emailed the hotel before our flight to let them know as room service would not yet have been into our room. I was hoping they could get it for us. I asked if they could post it and I would send them the money for postage or even just let us know if it is there and we would arrange pickup from a friend. Never heard back from them. Tried to call them, no answer. Please, do yourself a favour and don’t make the same mistake that we did.... do not stay here!

Not so yay..... the property has 2 elevators, one was still under construction (according to signage) and one was working....for about 12 hours and then there was not any elevators. Picture me, walking up over 500 steps just to get to the room and another 500 steps to get down to the lobby level.....needless to say, it was sweaty work and stinky as there was no ventilation and people were leaving their rubbish bags in the stairwells.We were told they would be fixed and during the stay the sign was updated 3 times saying they are still down....My paradise turned into an episode of Faulty Towers....To make matters worse, we were informed that because we were staying for 10 nights, our room would be serviced after the 6th night.....it wasn’t.....we spoke to the same lady 3 days in a row who lied to our faces saying it would be done.....it wasn’t.Ultimately due to Christmas and New Years, we were stuck at Faulty Towers....after 8 nights we got out and managed to find alternate accommodation. It took the two of us (with 3 suitcases) 47 minutes to get down.I adore Hawaii and it sucks that this place ruined my holiday.In terms of the room, it had stains and cracks in the ceiling, stains on the sheets upon check in, and dirty carpet.It’s hostel quality.As I mentioned at the beginning, the view was incredible, however I will add that the windows open giving you about a metre or more of open space and there is no barrier to keep you in, if you have children it would be a BIG safety concern.I spoke to an elderly resident who owns in this building and she had to go and book a hotel until the elevator works as she can’t do the stairs..... it’s not ok ....Beware of hotel deals and read reviews, lesson learnt.....","Sydney, Australia","769becg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",16,1.0

That place is the Waikiki Marina Tower. It was built in 1984. When you enter the property you will be magically transported back to that era (No time machine needed). We rented a corner condo on the 23rd floor. Our first, and only, time that the elevator worked took thirty minutes to get to our floor. The old building is being ""renovated"", although there are no signs of work being done. The one working elevator gave up the ghost at some point that night. We had to walk down 23 flights of steps to go out the next morning. The tiny condo had been remodeled inside but was still in need of serious work. The local bugs seemed to enjoy the spread more than we did.Any time that we went out, it was 23 flights down and 23 flights back up. When we went to leave, we had to tote all of our luggage down to the street. Yup, 23 more flights of fun!!!I think that effectively sums things up.

We had 9 days in Waikiki before boarding the cruise ship Norwegian Cruise Line. The cruise was reduced to five days due to Hurricane Lane. We arrived back in Port on the 1st September and had to be off the ship by 9am. We caught a taxi to the Marina Towers. Knowing that we would be too early to book in, we thought we would store our luggage and do another tour, to fill in the day. We arrived at the Hotel, only to find we couldn't get in and there was no Reception Counter. Finally, after speaking to other guests, who had already booked in, they told us a lady was coming down and to speak to her. She was not very helpful at all, mind you she did seem flustered. After a very long wait we finally managed to have our luggage stored. Our confirmation letter did not have a book-in time on it, so we were amazed to hear it was 4pm. We were booked in on a table in the car park. One positive was, we did manage to get in a little earlier because our room was ready. The room was in need of a lot of attention. The cupboards in the kitchen were falling apart, the air conditioner was so noisy, my husband could not sleep and the computer boxes and wires were exposed and just sitting on the floor near the bed. I was in the bathroom at the sink, when the cover over the light fell down and almost hit me. The signs on the lift were confusing saying only one was working, but at times both seemed to be working. The cleaner was there ready to clean before we even left the room just after 10am. We had to wait down stairs for almost an hour because the signs on the lift said not to leave it until the last minute. I realised I had left several pieces of clothing behind after washing and not putting certain items in the dryer. The cupboard I put them in would not stay open when you wanted to leave the room. Hence I forgot to collect them. So it turned out to be a very expensive stay. $200 USD was taken from our credit card and was to be refunded. At this time it still has not been refunded. So many other people were complaining about the cost of parking and not being able to access the complex. NO RECEPTION DESK AND NO TOUR DESK. So sorry we didn't go back to the Hotel we stayed in at the beginning of our holiday and it was cheaper than Marina Towers.

Early in February we narrowed our choices to Marina Towers Waikiki & one other. It was a very tough call, but Marina edged out over the other simply because of the ocean view.When we arrived, we had time to kill. There were no lockers to store luggage but valets allowed us to keep our luggage in their storage. So we killed time & returned at 3:30 for a 4PM for check in. However it took 60 minutes before anyone showed up to do the check-in. The ladies that check us in weren't the friendliest and seemed to be annoyed that they had to do it. The lady that did check us in asked for ID, my wife handed her Japanese ID to her only for the lady to say, No, your passport - which she should've asked for to begin with. By the time the elevators were working and we got in the room it was 5PM. Let me point out that this is what their website states: Elevator Renovation - Marina Tower Waikiki is undergoing an elevator renovation and MAY only have 1 elevator operational during work. You may have noticed that I capitalized 'may', this is because it is the key-word in that statement on their website. May is VERY misleading because it means expressing possibility. There was no possibility there, 1 elevator was operational the entire length of our stay. There was no mention either of the nice notice hanging by the elevators either, stating that it may take up to 45 minutes for a single elevator to reach all floors. Also, mentioned taking the stairs... we were on the 37th floor!!! It got stuck once and we had to walk down 20 floors. I have been in elevators a lot older than the ones at Marina Tower that I felt safer in.The view from the room was spectacular too bad the room wasn't. The stove didn't work. Well, half of it did but it was a little difficult to get working. There were little bugs around both sinks. The shower floor felt slimey there was mould around the edges. It was a little windy while we were there and the wind howled through or window. The window was closed, but the noise came from the furthest left side of the window, where it cannot be opened. The staff... well, what staff we actually saw and met, for the most part, seemed to be inconvenienced by being asked questions. Even the security person outside wasn't very friendly. I actually pointed out the ""office"" to someone that had questions, because a lady was inside. The lady then brought the person outside, pointed at the piece of paper on the wall saying, ""That's the office number. You have to call them. This isn't the office!"" It was if she was upset that either A: she had to actually speak to someone or B: because I pointed out where the ""not-the-office"" was. The friendliest staff member we met was the cleaning lady; she was actually very friendly and helpful.The last night there, I had to arrange for our ride to the airport, so I had to call someone for a pick up. For the 1st time, I picked up the phone in the hotel room... nothing... wait, I did hear something... music? Very low music, almost like I was on hold for someone. I pushed the buttons but got no tone, everything was plugged in & it should've been working. I checked again, but still only the low music playing. I should point out that the ""office hours"" until around 10 or 11 PM. I don't recall the exact hours, but the office was still open. When I went downstairs to the ""not the office"" door. The light was on but nobody was inside. I knocked but nothing. I only saw someone at the security desk 3 times in the 4 nights we stayed there. I asked where the nearest payphone was, she said across the street by the lights. Surprise, she was wrong. Yes, I did confirm everything she told me but, still wrong. I had to go searching for a phonebooth since our didn't work. Thankfully, I found one at another hotel. I will say this for Marina Tower Waikiki. The view is great, no question there. The location is also great because a lot of places can easily be walked too.

Wondering what a condo type rental would be. Didn't know what to expect but it was not this. Even though an efficiency I did expect some type of dresser not just a couple drawers in a newly updated vanity in the bath. We were ther 10 days and had to empty the kitchen drawers for storage. In addition we were given adequate hangers however none had a bar to hang pants or a skirt. We had to drape them across the only chair in the room. We did find out this is s condo hotel so there is some type of association.The building is tall and narrow. 40 floors with 4 units on each floor. As far as I know there was only one floor with laundry facilities and 2 of the washers were out of service. A sign stated they would be prepared the following month. It appears they were I. The process of changing they system. We were informed 2 days before we were to leave that one of the elevators was not working and we could cancel or our host would give us a reduced rate.. Since it was so late we accepted. After reading other posts not on the AirBnB site it appears it has been out of service since at least last Oct and wil be until into 2019. It appears we had not been told the truth from the beginning.The room had been redone and was clean. We were concerned that the bed be extra firm since back issues are very real problem. While the mattress appeared new it was definitely not firm.Finally one night while sleeping at about 3:30 am the fire alarm went off for about a minute or two and then stopped. About 15-20 people climbed down the stairs and found no security (who we learned leaves at 3 am) and no fire dept. We called 911 and the fire dept asked US if it was an emergency! Without coming out they somehow determined it was a false alarm. Strangest thing ever! The day were were leaving a sign was posted noted pest control was arriving on Thursday. Any unit desiring their service could pay $10. I hope it was not going to be a guest. We did see 2 small bugs early on and that is all.I would choose another place.,"Schaumburg, Illinois","peggyj49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Schaumburg, Illinois</strong>",4,1.0

Lets start off by saying the rooms look NOTHING like the picture posted. When we arrived the lady was very nice; she alerted us that both elevators were down so she could either credit our card so we could look for a different hotel or we would have to use the stairs (keep in mind other reviews say this happens a lot and its a 40 story building). We got the 11th floor & we really didnt want to go through the hassle of having to look elsewhere. Minus one star because there is no check-in counter & you have to call a number so they can meet you. Minus another star because we booked a half ocean/beach view & we did not get that. Minus the third star is because the rooms are not very nice and furniture is not in good condition & they still charge a $15 resort fee. We were there for 5 days and they charge an extra $50 if you want your room cleaned. The pros about this hotel is its location & that is why we also decided to stay. The mall & beach are both within a 10 min walking distance. ,,Brenda H,5,2.0

I did read the reviews and they were helpful in making sure I understood all issues. I was a bit freaked out as I had no idea what I was walking into. First I have to say, these are all the items you need to know upfront:If you want to check in late: you need to call the manager at 808-952-5200. They will direct you to your lockbox located on the right of the building where you will get your FOB and keycard. You will need to ask what the wifi password is, as I didn't have that in my room.IF you do check in late, you MUST register with the lady the following day between her hours to get your card re-activated, give her your credit card and ID.Checkin is in the outside lobby between 3-5pm. She is wearing a blue shirt. I found her very nice and accommodating. Sure it's in the garage, but it's nicely done up and I didn't feel at all any security issues in the evening. The room. I did book a deluxe ocean view room and I do have a nice view of that., but it's not the view I would get if I was on the 25th floor and above. I AM rather thankful it isn't on the 25 floor or above as the elevators would be a bit long. I had NO issues with elevators at any point. Both were running. There has been no longer than a 3-4 minute wait. I have waited longer at the Hilton.There is a $10 resort fee. Really not sure why...but it is what it is.My room was very clean, hardwood floors and fairly new kitchen/bathroom. The bed was actually quiet comfortable!Look it's not the Hilton or Sheraton...but I certainly wouldn't put it as a 2 star. Considering I paid $120 canadian with a full kitchen in Waikiki, I got a great deal. The beach is a 10 minute walk to the Fort Derussy Park beach (which happens to be my all time favourite part of the entire beach).I feel that some of the reviews may have merit, but I also feel many people didn't read the instructions either and each booking company has different rooms. If you do decide to book, call the lady at the number, tell her what booking agent you are using as she can tell you if your room is a sheit one or a good one. Remember booking via AirBNB or VRBO you could very well end up with a ""locals"" room and you have no idea what state it might be in.

Don't get me wrong, I have stayed in various places, from backpackers to 1-5 star rated resorts, but at least I knew what I was getting. This hotel is crap and way too expensive for what you get. Firstly the shuttle driver from the airport had to google it as he had not heard of it. It is on the far end of Waikiki so to get anywhere worthwhile, is a good 10 minute walk. No foyer/concierge, they meet you out the front to check you in. No tour desk. Only one elevator in use as the other one is being refurbished. Was out of action for an extremely long time. They have a sign up, apologising for this and state it may take 45 minutes for the one elevator to reach all floors. I did not have to wait 45 minutes, I would say 15 minutes was the norm. This made you limit how often you came and went. I also tried to stay out as long as possible as I am a smoker and to go out to have a cigarette, with only one elevator working, was just not feasible. To my surprise, in July I received an email stating I would be charged US$10 a day for resort fees. This was not stated to me when I made and fully paid for the booking in November, 2016. I booked through booking.com. So another US$40 more for 'resort fees' for the four nights. Resort?? What an absolute joke!! A tennis court, spa and small pool that was so overshadowed by trees, I had to go to the beach to soak up the sun. Alas, I did not use the 'resort'. I booked a deluxe room. My god, I would hate to see what their standard rooms are like. I looked into my neighbours room, who supposedly had the same room as me. Well theirs was completely different, much nicer and updated. Got me thinking that maybe the rooms are privately owned and that could explain the variations. I also believe this is a place where people actually live and are not just tourists/visitors. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it seems like the place just 'exists', with no upkeep but collecting a lot of money. My room was dirty with black strands of hair everywhere. So many things needed maintenance, I can't list them all. There was not even a 'tea towel' in the kitchenette. How are you meant to dry your dishes? When I got home I had to supply booking.com with the evidence of the extra US$40 charged that I was not made a where of when I booked. Took a few weeks but I got my money back. Worst experience ever.

I spent a week calling them to have the name switched to the winners name for no one to answer. When they did answer (20 mins before their office closed) they said I could do it. Problem solved right, no. The receptionist called me back after Chris, the assistant manager had already left, to tell me that they couldn't do it. So of course i'm upset, but I told her that I would show up for the check-in process but we will have to figure something out first. When we finally got the rental car and got to this dump, the receptionist had Chris on the phone to tell me that they cancelled my reservation. Why you ask? They ASSUMED I wanted to, and since I booked through expedia I had to call and try to fix it. When I told her that I didn't cancel it and that I wanted my room, Chris's and the receptionist's response was literally, ""I don't know what to tell you"". So needless to say we called Expedia and got it fixed and put our Hotel winners up in a nicer Hotel one block away. Not the way I wanted to spend my first three hours in Hawaii.

The toilet was placed really weirdly and the shower not much pressure. Kitchen with everything you needed. Overall the room was fine and was what you would expect for something cheap.

If you have unfortunately booked this place leave the fob and keys in your room on checkout. Regardless of what the sheet says. The room (1002) was a disgrace. It stank and I mean overwhelmingly reeked. The Wi-Fi password was wrong but worked on other room numbers (Wi-Fi is linked to each room). The toilet, was impractically placed and virtually useless. Furthermore the whole thing moved when you sat down and you need to be a contortionist to actually use the roll holder. The shower was what stank and the soap was not cleaned out from God knows when see my photos attached. Naturally we raced downstairs to complain/change rooms but lo and behold the ""receptionist"" had vanished already. Called the numbers given and no one answered, for three days. Don't bother asking any of the residents there. They are about as useful as a box of hair and lack any people skills. The elevators are a joke. So so so ridiculously slow pretty much all morning. We pressed the button waited for probably 5 minutes, went back to our room finished packing. Came back out with our luggage and it still hasn't turned up. Finally turned up to be greeted by a half full elevator with a resident basically telling us to forget it and wait for the next one. Love the residents...We used the stairs and beat the elevator down to the ground floor. That felt really good just quietly...To be fair they have an announcement on the wall about upgrading the elevators due to be finished in wait for it two years time.Furthermore if you're disabled in a rush or on the 38th floor? Too bad you guys all just deal with it not their problem whether your a paying customer or not. How lovely.Check out my photo of the notice.Do yourself a favour and please do not stay here.

The answer is Marina Tower. That's odd you might think. It's back from the ocean, sits down a lane, and has no real amenities . There are reasons and here they are.First, we aren't interested in a destination resort. As restaurant critics we're in the city to work. Since it's business price is a big criteria. At $109 to $119 a night for a panoramic ocean view room you can't do much better in Honolulu.Then, what about the panoramic view ocean view room? They're on top of the building and look out over the Pacific. During day time you can see Pearl Harbor and Diamond Head. At night the lights are absolutely magical.This is a condo hotel. The lower floor rooms aren't anything to write home about. But on top the owners know what they have and use it themselves. The difference shows.

We booked a full ocean view for barely more than a partial and were very pleased we did. We could see from the Lagoon all the way along the coast to the airport. Beautiful.But don't be expecting luxury.

You check in with the Equus Hotel next door and any queries are dealt with there.Our room was next to the elevators and was noisy because of that.The elevators were working when we stayed although slow, but they put a note on them the day we were leaving to say repairs were to be carried out until 2019! We were on the 32nd floor and if this had been the case when we were there it would have been a nightmare. I had requested a lower level room on booking but had not been given this request.The room itself was comfortable and spacious for the price. It had a fridge, microwave, stovetop etc, although a bit of a small space to cook a meal. The decor is aging in the kitchen/bathrooms and the cleanliness could have been better. There is no restaurant in the hotel although there is a local delivery service. There is free wifi throughout and there are laundry facilities. The hotel has a private pool and tennis courts which are lovely and also very quiet when we were there. The rooms are not serviced during your stay, but a change of sheets and plenty of towels are provided.

Could this condo have used some TLC? Yes. Did I sleep well, eat well, not catch any diseases and was close to all things Honolulu.... yes. Was it clean? So-so. The shower didn't drain well and was dirty in the corners. Did the elevators work? Only one (due to high winds, the sign said...there are two elevators) and it did take a while to catch it- avg 2-5 min), but like the locals say ""Aren't you on vacation? Then you are on Hawaii time!"" . Was the furniture dated? yes, but it was comfy. Go to any average home on the island and see what they have for furniture...you will no longer complain. The kitchen was small but useful and functioned. Full size fridge with freezer. Washer and dryer on both the 3rd and 4th floors, worked fine (coin operated). The pool was clean and refreshing, as was the jacuzzi. There is a wonderful brand new barbeque located near the pool. Be sure to grill up some food there. The window in our room opened to the marina view, on the 36th floor. We slept with it closed at night and the AC on, which is a bit loud but I love a noise to sleep to anyway, Main point- it worked and our place was very cool. During the day we left it open and it was a beautiful breeze. No trace of any insects in our room. there is also a security guard posted outside, I noticed them every evening (as we were gone all day I cannot say if they were there then) and watched them do regular rounds (I can see their desk from the pool/jacuzzi).In summary, this place could use an update, mostly the bathroom, but if you are a fussy yuppie, feel free to go down the street to the Hilton and get what you want, and what you'll surely pay for. This place was a good enough deal for being in the heart of Waikiki. one more note- this building is shaped like a triangle. On the side facing inland, towards the city and mountains, is the elevators. on the other two sides are two condos per side, so four rooms per floor. Therefore, all rooms higher up have a great view.

The shower spray head was designed by a mad engineer I am sure.The elevators were something else. It seemed that the two elevators take turns on breaking down everyday. Allow plenty of time for waiting. While waiting one day, the owner of another unit was there and he said the building is planning to replace the elevators later this year. They need to.There seems to be ABC store all over the place. The first night when we arrived we bought some bread and bananas from the ABC around the corner. The small loaf of bread cost $6.99. The banana cost $0.79 EACH. Go somewhere else. Yes, the place was jammed with tourists so prices of everything should be expected to be high. We went for dinner at the Outrigger Waikiki one night, the parking at the hotel was $12 for about an hour.We took a taxi from the airport. The meter showed about $35.

The front desk was courteous and even though I couldn't check in early they were quite helpful. Once checked in the room was certainly no 5 star hotel. But I don't think it's worth the bad reviews people are giving. For the price it had a reasonably comfortable king size bed. Stove top. Air con. A decent size bathroom. It had everything we needed and more. We were pleasantly surprised that this hotel was not what all the people have made it out to be. Sure you can stay in central Waikiki. But your paying twice as much.. And for what .. The trolley leaves right across the road and is $2 for a trip and take approx 10 mins to get to the beach. The shopping centre is a 5 minute walk. The Hilton beach and lagoon are a 5 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants close by. Abc store on the corner. Both myself and my partner would definitely recommend staying at this hotel as its a fraction of the price of central Waikiki and still has a comfort about it ! It probably could do with a repaint and freshen up - but really that's about all :) Really enjoyed our stay - the valet even started work 20 minutes early so we could get our car on time to make it to Spartan race at Kualoa ranch on time !

The unit is clean & decorated very nicely. The bath towels are large & fluffy & the shower works great. The building location is very convenient & it was great to have parking included. An ABC grocery store is located very close by. The view through the immense windows was gorgeous & perhaps made up for any minor issues (noted below) we experienced during our stay.We used the smaller of the two refrigerators so we could turn down the temp on the larger one as it was a bit noisy. Also noisy (to my husband) was the window air conditioning unit, although it masked traffic noise & did help me sleep. The elevator noise was bothersome to me but not my husband, perhaps because he slept on the side of the bed away from the door. An elevator was closed for one day during our stay because of high winds & the other one felt a little shaky & required a long wait. Nice view of the city, though, from the glass elevator.I would recommend that the management buy sheets that fit the bed. Ours kept coming off over & over again no matter how tightly we tucked them in & would bunch up underneath us during the night. We did not use the laundry facilities, tennis court or pool, so cannot comment on them. We saw others using the court & they seemed to be having a good time.Overall we had a lovely stay here. It was a good base for travel around the island, Waikiki & Honolulu in general. Checking in/out was easy & instructions provided by the owner/manager were clear.","Verona, Wisconsin","Sue H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Verona, Wisconsin</strong>",14,4.0

It was a last-minute non-refundable arrangement that had been made without consulting me. Needless to say, after reading the recent TripAdvisor reviews and ratings, I was dreading my stay there. Realizing that a better hotel would cost at least $100/night more (not to mention the non-refundable situation), we decided to stick it out. What a relief to find that our room was better than expected, considering the last minute booking and the “budget” price. When we arrived in our room, I realized that we had stayed in the same hotel about 9 or 10 years on a different floor and I recall that it was a bad experience. This hotel is a condominium hotel, which means that the rooms belong to individual owners or a time share. The hotel is located behind the Equus Hotel which manages the Marina Tower bookings. When arriving at the Marina Tower via a circular driveway, new guests must walk to the street-side lobby of the Equus Hotel to register. There is no notice anywhere on the Marina Tower building that directed us to do this (except a phone # posted to call for information) and the only way we found out was from another guest. Entrance into the Marina Tower lobby and hotel is with a security key only. Pros:Amazing views (26th floor)Lots of natural light in the roomHuge windows that opened almost all the way (no safety feature, so be careful with children)Fairly clean overall (no bugs)Clean bed linensKitchenette with full-size fridge, full range with oven, microwaveGood shower pressure, plenty of hot waterTV with many channelsFree wifi (which didn't work)Friendly registration at Equus Hotel0.3 mile walk from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (and conference)0.5 mile walk to the nearest beach0.3 mile walk to the Ala Moana Center0.3 mile walk to grocery store for fruits and vegetables and convenience foods½ block to bus stopCons:Kingsize bed needed to be replaced. I could feel the springs poking through the mattress.Wicker chairs were old and ready to be replaced.Tiny shower (approx. 3' x 4')Bathroom had mildewy smell.Stingy on towels: sometimes there would be wash cloths, at other times not; same with bath mat.Cleaning was spotty, mostly consisting of replacing used towels and emptying trash. I made my own bed three days in a row since the cleaning person did not show up until the afternoon. Bed linens were changed on the fourth day.Elevators were noisy and sounded like a jet taking off. This was especially disturbing at night.Elevators were a bit shaky and would inexplicably stop and linger at the 21st floor without the doors opening.Marina Tower lobby's artificial flower fragrance (infuser) was overpowering and head ache inducing. If other guests on the same floor were cooking, the aromas would drift into the hallway and into our room and linger. Even at the 26th floor there was a lot of street noise (traffic, sirens).I have been in many hotels, budget or luxury, in Waikiki over many years. This hotel was not out of the ordinary for a budget accommodation.

Finding the hotel was the first problem as it's not sign posted at all. It turns out to be a tower behind another building. We arrived at 10am not expecting to get into our room and were told that we could have a lower floor room with partial ocean view right away but as we had booked a Deluxe Ocean View Room with king size bed we opted to wait till later to check in. The hotel kindly allowed us to leave our luggage and off we headed to explore the island. After returning early evening we checked in, received our room confirmation and key from the Equus hotel reception (who apparently manage the hotel which is set behind). We proceeded to the tower building and lift lobby leading to our hotel room. Alarm bells should have rung loudly when we noticed the pest control notification sign on the lift lobby wall indicating their next visit was January! We climbed aboard the slowest and most rickety lifts and proceeded upwards at a snails pace, passing outside and up the face of the building to floor 28. When we stepped out there were only 4 rooms per floor and the decor was pretty hideous and unwelcoming but that was nothing to what greeted us when we unlocked our Deluxe Ocean View Room..... it was like stepping back in time! We were greeted with a very dated interior, two twin beds - not a king or even queen bed in sight! The room was smelly and did not look anything like the pictures we had viewed on the internet (I will post some of possible)We decided to go back to the neighbouring hotel reception to complain and so back into the old rickety lifts once more to queue once again at the reception to be told that all rooms were full and nothing could be done tonight.... obviously lots of other unfortunate guests in the establishment. Resigned to being stuck here we got back in the lifts and upwards we went again.... our holiday gradually slipping away in the time machines otherwise known as lifts. To describe this as deluxe is stretching the definition to its absolute limits! We are currently here in this hotel 27th Dec 2014 wondering what went wrong! It's ok to stay somewhere knowing it is a little rough around the edges but when you book somewhere expecting one thing and receiving another you feel like you've been mugged. The shower sounds like the floor vibrates when you turn it on. The kitchenette looks like it's been in since the 70's. The twin beds have a single sheet as a cover and no sign of any blanket, which we've not experienced before! We have been told that they will try to move us tomorrow to a 'better' room however I'm not holding my breath as the whole of wikiki is booked up!

The people are very friendly with excellent rates. If it's available I will definitely stay there again. There are a few things you need to know though. There is no pool or exercise room and if you're on the higher floors you may find the outside elevators a little scarey with a bit of a wait time.

I've been stuck 3 times in an elevator and with this elevator being outside it does sway and get stuck. When we arrived were supposed to shower and go back out, I refused to go back down. Saved me money I guess but I told myself not to fall asleep, I was figuring out how can I get back down and escape and convince my husband how we could just forget the $348 we spent through AIRBNB.COM to David Roger's Royal Hawaiian Realty in room 3204. I woke up around 5am to the building moving, trade winds blowing strong enough to create sounds of sirens and just glad the dawn was coming so maybe I could really get us to go to another hotel and throw all that money away. Well had to end up enduring it and so each time we came back we stayed in with not a chance to use that terrifying elevator more than we had to. The last day I even got the security guard's phone number and emailed Mariah Dailey who is the manager for the sister building Equus on Sunday, she has since not replied to how frequent the elevator gets stuck and what people do in that instance if they're inside because it's not like someone can just open the elevator up and walk out, it's OUTSIDE!!! It was okay for me inside if you really ignore the water damage in the bathroom and the peep looking hole above the toilet. I was reading all the reviews while inside the Waikiki Marina. The thing about Airbnb is they make it seem like it's someone's residence so since you don't know 1700 Ala Moana is the same place as the Waikiki Marina because they don't tell you the address till you book. You also don't know about all the awful reviews on tripadvisor.com or yelp.com I say that's pretty misleading. Had I known that I would have booked directly through Hotels.com the $95 for 3 nights and paid $20 parking a night which would still have been less and I get credit for each stay with hotels.com Aside from feeling like this guy trusted us by giving us the lockbox combo, etc to the room, I feel taken.

The rooms are not cookie cutter, each is different, and the condition of the rooms varies based upon the the owner. Whenever renting a vacation property due diligence is the key to a successful visit. We recently sold a home in Boston and relocated to Waikiki. We had previously stayed at the Equus, an adjacent property. Given that this was to be an extended stay we wanted a kitchenette so we contacted Mariah Dailey the General Manager at the Equus and Marina Tower. We explained our needs for a long term stay with a flexible check out date. Mariah was incredibly accommodating and arranged for us to reserve a room on the 34th floor with a full ocean view. When we arrived we were greeted by a staff member who presented us with a cool drink and a lei. The room was fully equipped with everything necessary for an extended stay: cooking and eating utensils, coffee pot and even a corkscrew. The view was incredible: rainbows, the Ilikai and Hilton Hawaiian Village Fireworks on Friday nights. The price was a third of comparable units in the vicinity. During our stay we were impressed by the friendliness of the staff and their efforts to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Lorenia Levya the General Manager of the property exhibited an attention to detail that was simply incredible. She provided us with change for the on premise laundry and even provided complimentary laundry detergent. On one occasion after a rain shower I found her mopping the entryway and elevator lobby. That is dedication!During our stay the elevators were an issue. One evening we did have to climb 34 flights of stairs to our suite, carrying a case of wine. It was an inconvenience but it was put in perspective by the performance the housekeeping and security staff. They were tasked with cleaning and securing the high rise without elevators and they performed marvelously and without complaint. We found a long term condo rental after two weeks in Honolulu, much to our surprise. When we informed the Marina Tower that we would leaving early there was absolutely no problem.

We had to re-book every night while we were waiting for an apt to open up. Rooms were dated, tho we stayed in 3 different ones - and some were better than others, so there is a great difference in some of them. They were all bigger rooms than most other hotels, and had lots of large storage. The kitchen was nice - again, first one we stayed in was pretty old and sad looking, and the last two pretty good. Everything was clean, although in the first room there were tiles broken and rusty stove and needed new paint and carpet stained, so it looked pretty pathetic. The next two we stayed in were nicer, with newer appliances, and good carpet and paint. The wi fi was good, and free. The people were really nice, and Rene at the front desk was really helpful and nice. We had first booked the room through Hotwire, but then had to keep booking for two more nights, and we just did it through her for the other nights and it was cheaper. It is close to the beach, although you have to walk around the marina a little ways to the left to get to the sand beach, and around to the right to get to Ala Moana park. But not a bad walk, and close by, maybe 3 short blocks altogether. Another nice thing was that they had free MaiTais a couple of nights in the deck/lobby area. It is also close to food, McDonalds and Dennys is right up the street, and lots of other choices right there close like Red Lobster and Outback. They have two buildings, and it is a little confusing because you have to check in at the Equis which is actually in front of the Marina Tower, but that isn't too difficult to do. The prices are good, it was the least expensive we could find, on short notice, and for $99, you can't really expect a lot. They are all independently owned, so some are better than others. As I said, the rooms are large with lots of storage for boogie boards or chairs or beach stuff. The whole wall is cabinets that connect, so storage isn't a problem. The bad things are that some of the rooms are not nice looking, although they are clean. The first night I thought there was dirt - but it was just the paint and worn tile that made it look dirty. The beds were also comfortable, and the linens were clean and fresh and I appreciated that. For the money, I was very happy - although it isn't the Marriott!! The kitchenette was especially nice to have - with the prices of food over there, that was really a plus, and added a lot to the value of the room. You can't usually get a hotel room there with a kitchenette, you have to rent a condo, which are more expensive. The one thing I really missed though, was not having a lanai. I like to sit out on a balcony as often as possible, and there are none here. Also, apparently some of the rooms have views, but ours didn't. It wasn't bad, you just couldn't see the ocean from where we were. But it was clean and cheap, and close to everything, and they had rooms available every night, so that made it good for us!! I think that you can ask to move rooms if they have them available, or you can upgrade in price to get a better one. They are all different, so I think that if there was one in the same category they would let you switch for no more money.","Claremont, Ca","bradykenadee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Claremont, Ca</strong>",42,4.0

The first red flag should have been all the trick photography, my friends showed after we had to book a last minute room for me. The next re flag should have been the fact that there is no such location. This place is more condos, than it is a hotel and some of the ""rooms"" they show are of condos that are rented by the owners of each condo, not the so called hotel.Check in is crazy, because there is no check in desk for this location. You must check in at another hotel, which means lugging your bags up a flight of stairs, then back down to the very back of the lot. You're handed a door clicker that looks like a car alarm device.It was late and I was tired, but there was only one elevator working with 11 people waiting in front of me. This is when i learned that these people lived in the building and they were more than happy to give me all the dirt on the place. Like ""bed bugs"" ""mice"" and having to wait long periods of time for the elevators. They even warned me about flooding.I waited 15 minutes before I was finally able to get on the elevator to the 35 floor. When I walked into the rood it was hot as hell, so right away I looked for the air conditioner, I was shocked to see the old school square, accordion style unit mounted with wood in the corner of the window. I turned it on and right away I saw the light that says ""service filter"" come on. After 45 minutes at the lowest setting, the room was still like a sauna.The toilet in the bathroom was filled with water and had human waste in it. I called the front desk and I was told it would be taken care of in the morning. There was only one towel in the room.The bed was horrible, I could feel every single coil and wire in it. It was like sleeping on two stacked box springs. There were no cover on the bed, just sheets and no cover were located in the roomThe next morning when ""house keeping finally arrived they acted surprised that someone was in the room, telling me that were told i was moved to another room. This is when I called the front desk (other hotel) again. That was yet another problem. In most hotels you simply dial the front desk by pressing 0, but here I had to make a phone call. Again I was told it would be taken care of. By the time I came back from a full day of exploring the counter was filled with water and the floor was soaked. the toilet had once again overflowed, but this time the wall had water running down it. You could actually here the water collecting and dripping in the space above the toilet. The shower only gave nearly cold water and again there were no toiletries left in the room. However there were plenty of towels which I had to use to soak up all the water on the floors.By morning water was leaking from the ceiling in the main room and running down the counter near the microwave which also did not work and seeping from behind the mirror. Calling the front desk was no longer an option because now the phone in the room did not work.I called my friends Tina and Andy who stayed at the Prince across the street and told them what was happening. I checked out two hours early to join them in their AWESOME hotel.This place is a complete dive, the hotel manager would not come to the front desk to speak with me and they refused to give me a check out receipt. One of the guys was in such a hurry to get me out so others could not hear my complaints, but two couples checking in asked me and I was all too happy to tell and show them what took place my two nights.If you find yourself in Waikiki, this place is not where you want to stay.

I don't know when she planned on letting us know! She could not find a room for us at that time and we did not find out the name of it until the morning that we left our condo on the Big Island and it was owned by a friend of hers. Unfortunately, the taxi driver at the airport never heard of the place & dropped us off at the wrong building.

After calling her, she came down to the building & walked us & our luggage to our location, about a block down, having to cross the busy main street. The room was made to look nice with some furnishings and décor, but on closer inspection we found it to be old, dirty, roughly finished in some areas & not finished in other areas, half the outlets did not work, the dishes & utensils left there were filthy, and it was very crowded and extremely noisy. There was no lanai as we had booked at our first place, as it had been enclosed in the room cutting drastically on the size of the room. The lamps had old plugs from the 50's, & half didn't work. The outlets by the stove did not work nor did half of the other outlets. It was so scary & gross we ate out the entire time which defeated the point of having a kitchen available. The bathroom fan was inside the shower and we were afraid of getting shocked. Also the shower head was too low for my husband. The view was next to nothing, which was complete opposite of what we had booked initially. The 2 elevators were right by our room & extremely loud & ran until after midnight every night as there is 40 floors. It was so bad that we had to sleep with ear plugs in!

It's a bit of a weird setup, but The Equus seems to own/maintain The Marina Tower (which does not have a front desk). It was our 1 year anniversary (it's not much of a milestone), and they made it a special one by upgrading us to the 39th floor with an ocean view, just 1 floor under the penthouse. The staff at the desk were always friendly and helpful whenever we approached them. Needless to say, we were pretty floored by the gesture and was further floored by the great view. It would be a 'spectacular' view, but other hotels blocked the full view of the ocean and beaches. You do get a glimpse of Ala Mona Park/beach and the Hilton Lagoon though, which are exquisite specimens of paradise.The A/C was horrible, and is really the only investment most necessary to be upgraded. One really neat thing though, is that the room came with a freezer chest! Upon this discovery, we had to get some ice cream.The room was clean but a bit dingy. Few of the power outlets did not work, but we got by. Elevators are indeed the slowest around, and makes some of the worst noises for anyone that is afraid of heights.All in all, you get what you pay for.

Also right across from the Hilton, which is a fun place to visit even if you're not staying there (they don't check if you're staying, so you can pretty much use all their amenities).I'd highly recommend this place if you're on a budget and just want a place to rest your head for the night.","Vancouver, Canada","P T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

For rooms on the south side of the building, there is an almost-great view of the ocean that's blocked by a few high-rises. The swimming pool is very small, but it's well-maintained.Cons: based on my discussion with other guests who did have a hotel room there, I know that their room layout was the same as ours. The window-mounted A/C unit was extremely noisy and failed to regulate the room temp well. I spent every night alternating between turning on the A/C or opening the window. The room is also very oddly shaped with a ledge about 3' from the ground that juts into the room and eliminates about 30 square feet of usable space. The 2 elevators are agonizingly slow. The fact that they have absolutely no ventilation coupled with glass walls which are fully exposed to the sun most of the day make the slow ride tortuous.

We knew when the light in the shower sounded like a swarm of bees was dying inside it.It's weird-- you recognize all the things from the photos you've seen, but everything is just slightly off enough that you know you're in for trouble.

The marina tower is a condo hotel, so there are people that actually live there. Cutting to the chase, we ended up getting our car towed while staying there in their garage. The communication on how the parking worked at this hotel was not clear and in the end our car got towed and we had to foot the bill ($187 plus cab fare) to get it back. We got in on Thursday, the guy there that night said they we were full on parking at their place, so we parked at the hale Koa garage ( about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel) since I was a DOD employee. The next day Friday, was another guy, named Jason and I asked about parking and he said yes they did have parking and ask for my room number. Gave him the room number and he handed me a a piece of paper of what looked like a receipt to me and then he hands me the garage key with the parking stall number for us to park. He asked for our license plate and I gave it to him. During all of this not once did he mentioned to make sure that the paper he gave me was to be displayed in car or the Garage key with the stall number to be displayed in the car. Again, I thought it was a receipt because when I tried to pay him for the stay of the parking, he told me to hold on to it until check out. We go to find the parking spot and a car was all ready in it. I go back to tell him this and he said to just park anywhere it says Hotel guest parking. Come to find out later in the vacation, that car was a resident at the marina tower and he had a special tag on his car. So we parked in whatever spot we could find with the Hotel Guest parking sign for three nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, Monday 1030am we go to the garage to find out our car is gone! We go to the front desk, where I tell Athena, our car is missing. She asked for the room number and then repeated the license plate to us and I said yes that is our car. She tells it got towed because they thought it was trespassing because there was no tag on it. I told her we never give a tag, then she asked me about the paper that I thought was a receipt and that is when i mentioned to her that Jason did not tell us about that. Athena said that was the parking pass or the garage key that had the stall number attached. In any case, she called us the cab and wrote what tow company they called. I did not understand how our car got towed if we parked there for 3 nights with no issue. Also, they did had signs about the parking but for some reason I did not put two and two together and thought it was for the people living at the marina tower. I wanted to speak with the manager after we got our car back but was told they would not be in until Tuesday. Tuesday came, talked with Rene, and she was sorry about had happen. She meet with me half way and refunded us through hotels.com (that is where we booked through) a night stay and we got a pineapple boat. All this time, I couldn't understand what was the point then of giving our license plate if they where only going to look in the car to see if it had a piece of paper or tag. We stopped parking there the rest of our week vacation and parked at the hale koa garage. Note: Doesn't matter what hotel you stay in Waikiki have to pay for parking so make sure you put that into your budget, $15-20 a night.So the moral of this whole experience, pay attention to the signs carefully, and if you are parking in any garage anywhere, display your receipt/ticket/ whatever it is they give you because you will get towed. As for the the rooms, it was not bad, we didn't stay in it all day of course, just needed it to sleep and shower. I think the Equus has the nicer rooms that everyone is speaking of, we stayed in the marina tower the ones with the kitchens. I am unsure if I would stay here again.

EVER.There were some major issues including:-No water for 15 hours, when the hotel said it would be around 3 or 4.-BUGS (gigantic ones!) everywhere in the room. Alive and crawling.-They moved us to a room that had no bed.Overall, the decor looks nothing like the pictures online. It is about as disappointing as you can expect--very dirty, old furnishings and tiles, no bathtub, limited amount of pillows and towels, cranky loud elevator. Everything looks like it came from the 60s--old and needs lots of updating. The free ""continental breakfast"" was a complete joke--slices of bread, one type of fruit, and small amounts of juice and coffee is NOT appropriate and certainly nothing to promote. They don’t even have basic amenities like a hair dryer & shampoo and their tiny 2 ounce bar of soap had holes in the wrapper. I can only imagine how old that soap was!Seems like the housekeeping and maintenance departments don't speak very good English either. We had an issue with our shower stall (this was after they got the water back on after 15 hours), where the water didn't turn on and the hot and cold knobs didn't work properly, and we called somebody up to work on it. The guy spent almost 2 hours trying to fix it and finally said that he'd have to come back the next day because he couldn't fix it right then. Hence, our plans for the evening changed because we weren't able to take a shower for 2 days. My husband went down to the front desk many, many times to inquire about the water situation and the staff was not very responsive. It seems like communication wasn't a big importance at this place.We were so angry about the whole situation that we called Priceline, the company that we booked the package through and spoke with a rep and demanded a refund, and he informed us that he'd have to contact the hotel first to see what they can do. After awhile, they said the hotel was only able to refund back one night....which was certainly not enough for the horrible experience!!!Disgusting. Atrocious. That's how I'd describe this hotel.

Even though we had reserved a room with twin beds over three months earlier, they said that due to overbooking, they only had a king size bed available in the Marina Tower, but that they could provide a rollaway, which we agreed to. Well, the rollaway never appeared. We tried calling down to the front desk several times but the line was always busy. At it turns out, the telephone number listing pasted on the room phone was old. They had changed it from ""2303"" to ""0"" but had neglected to change the notice on the phone. My wife thus had to put up with me bouncing around on the king size bed all night as a result.Another problem was . . . cockroaches! Many were small but no matter how many we killed, the next time we looked, there were more! The next morning I found out that their rooms in the Marina Tower are simply condo apartments that the hotel manages. While there are regular pest treatments for the tower itself, the owners are responsile for their own apartments and many don't request regular fumigation. The result is the bugs just move around the building and are never completely exterminated.Oh, did I mention that there was only one elevator for the 36-floor tower? The other was 'out of order' due to the somewhat gusty winds. The winds had calmed down enough the next morning for them to start it up again, fortunately.The next morning we requested a move to the Equus Hotel proper, and were much happier campers there. The room was clean, although basic. For those who plan to use their computers in the room, there is free LAN service, but no WiFi. There is a single for-fee computer in the tiny lounge area on the main floor that you have to feed $1 bills if you want to print out your boarding pass, and there is even an extra charge for each page printed out. How chintzy can you get!Another small problem with the room is the shower. It is small, but adequate although there is no place to put your own shampoo and rinse except on the floor.","Osaka, Japan","trobb49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Osaka, Japan</strong>",39,3.0

CONS- When we arrived we thought that it didn't look very nice. You have to walk up a flight and a half of stairs to get to the main lobby. The elevator is right when you walk in so it felt like the staff doesn't have to communicate with you if they don't want to. We were really sad that there wasn't a hot tub. We came back from our first day of walking all day and all night and wanted to soak in the hot tub and they said it was apart of the ""Marina Tower"" an they no longer are apart of that. They have a teeny tiny pool that is freezing cold and it is shaded so you can't lay out in the sun. Another problem was hotel parking. We rented a car in the morning and then at night when we got back to the hotel there was 1 slot open. So we parked in it and went to tell them we were parked (it's $18 a night) and they said the lot was full for the night. They only had 8 parking slots for the whole hotel. We had to go to a parking garage across the street. It was okay but it was just inconvenient. and annoying. I asked in the morning if there was any open slots and they said they wouldn't know for awhile until someone checked out or returned the car. The hotel is right next to the street so the road noise was extremely loud.PROS- The room was fine. The mini fridge was nice so we could buy bottled water at the grocery store to save a little money. I say the room was nice because we were only in it at night to go to bed. It was a good location.

The hit was the view of the Ocean View room. The miss was that on day 2 I could smell cigarette smoke in my bathroom from one of the other rooms which was a owner occupied room. At this hotel the Marina Tower was both a hotel and a apartment complex. On day 3 I arrived back to my room to the smell of marijuana in my room. The smell was so strong it was unbearable. I called down to the desk and spoke to Rene who sent a maintenance guy to check out the smell. Once he got there and I opened the door the guy went ""wow that's weed. He then went on the tell me that the guy next door to 3203 always gets high and the smell usually goes into the hallway.I requested and was then given a room at the Equus. No more ocean view and the room was the noisiest room you can imagine with construction going on outside the hotel all night long. For this inconvenience Renee the Manager called me to tell me that she would comp two nights of parking worth $36.00. What a frustrating stay and a way to lose a customer forever. Rene if you are reading this a unhappy customer tells at least 20 people about a bad experience. I will be doing my part to spread the word.

I did manage to find the parking lot for the Equus . . . let me tell you, it is a tight squeeze! I reserved a room in the Marina Tower which is located in the building behind the Equus hotel. The Marina tower also has its own parking lot and what appears to be a registration lobby, which was never manned the entire time I was there (around 15 hours). There were also two stalls for registration. On reflection, I realize now that that is where I should have parked, then walked over to the Equus hotel desk to check in. As it was, check-in went quickly and I was given a remote clicker to open the gate to the upper parking area in the Marina Tower. The layout is that the entrance to the Marina Tower lots comes before the entrance to the Equus hotel lot via a one-way street (actually two-way, but separated by a median that can't be crossed). So to get to the Marina Tower lot, I had to exit and either go around the block, or make two U turns at traffic lights to get turned around to approach the lots again.So finally, I get to the Marina tower lot and the remote clicker doesn't work in opening the gate. Am I in the right building? Yes! Fortunately, the normally un-manned front door had someone there. And that person was the one who programmed the remotes for the hotel guests. He did some fiddling around with the clicker and decided that I was given a clicker that was never programmed. I had to go back to the lobby to get a new remote. Finally, I was able to park and get into my room! Needless to say, I left the car in the lot and took the bus into Waikiki for dinner. Parking was $18/night, not $20 as I've read in other reviews.As for the room, it was on the 23rd floor. It was studio room on the smallish side, but I was there for just a night so this was not an issue for me. The room looks pretty much like what is shown at the hotel's website, so I was not surprised. The view was fairly nice -- that of other hotels, but with the occasional glimpse of the ocean and horizon, and a bit of the marina. I spent all of 1 minute looking at it. Actually, the view is really nice at night.The room had a small air conditioner that I thought would be unable to cool the room. It did the job adequately, thank goodness. Internet worked fine, not wireless though. I did not use the kitchenette or breakfast since I checked out before the breakfast was ready. The room had an amazing amount of storage for its size. The flooring was tiled in the kitchenette area and hardwood (nice!) in the bed area. The only drawback was room's proximity to the elevators. The elevators sounded like a muted jet plane going by at random times during the hour. Ever watch the Blue Angels (Navy/Marine) or the Thunderbirds (Air Force) at air shows? It kind of sounded like that. I ended up having to use the earplugs that I brought along.The front desk and the lobby is open 24 hours. I was able to print out my boarding pass for about $3 at the business center. Unless you plan on surfing the internet, do not use a credit card which demands a $5 minimum charge. Would I stay here again? For $85/night plus $18/night parking -- Yes, I would.","Richmond, California","Bay_Arean2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, California</strong>",124,3.0

The next best things are: affordable price, a location near a nice section of Waikiki Beach and the Ala Moana Mall, and a decent sized swimming pool and spa.This hotel is comprised of two separate buildings adjacent to each other. My wife and I stayed in the Marina Tower, which is a 40-story structure that rises from a relatively small footprint. Our floor contained four units that faced the ocean, and I assume that all the residential floors have a similar configuration. Rooms boast that they have a partial ocean view. The view gets better as you go higher, and our 38th floor unit afforded us a spectacular vista to the west.The quality of the units can vary because the hotel is actually a condo hotel with units individually owned. However, the staff try their best to accommodate to the visitor's needs. Our unit was quiet (except that we needed to keep the window air conditioner going almost all the time), and the bed was very comfortable. A continental breakfast is included (7:30 to 9:00 AM), but, if you're an early riser like us, don't bother waiting for it. Go out to enjoy the cooler early morning hours, and find a munch elsewhere.The pool and spa don't open until 9:00 AM, but it stays open until at least 9:00 PM, so you can relax after a grinding day in the city.

We went 2 nights without hot water and the staff did not seem to be concerned nor offer any concessions for the trouble. I assume this is due to the fact that this is not only a hotel but also maintains long term residents who they are probably used to dealing with being stuck in lease.The room itself did not reflect the pictures we saw online, the furniture was very dated, curtains filthy, windows filthy.

Of course everything looks perfect on the website, but the truth is that they did not sure anything about this Marina Tower. The rooms at Marina Tower are outdated and I have to call the front desk and waited 15 minutes for a hairdryer.

When I checked in I was informed I'd be staying in the Marina Tower. This was not what I planned on, I researched a lot of hotels before deciding on this one, but was open minded. I should have known by the tone of the clerks voice what I was in for. At first I didn't think it was so bad because I had stayed here a few years ago with my mom and had a great room on the 32nd floor. I believe these are independently owned which would explain my disappointment. I got a key to a room on the 10th floor. This tower seemed nearly abandoned, the former office was closed and one of the elevators was not operating. There was a shady looking gentleman that appeared to be homeless sitting in the lobby and another man got on the elevator with me. As an afterthought the shady looking man got in the elevator with us. I was traveling alone so hesitated to push the button to my floor until they both pushed theirs. The man hesitated, which scared me. I got off at my floor and opened the door to my room. One word, scary. The walls were nearly bare, the furniture was old, cheap and sparce, the room appeared less than clean. I turned on the light to the bathroom with hesitation and a horrible screeching noise that sounded like a small animal made me scream, it turned out to be a squeaky exhaust fan. My cell phone had no reception at all on this floor. The view was of a close by apartment building. The coffee pot looked dirty. I sat on the bed for a second and it was hard as a rock. I didn't even set my bags down. I went downstairs, gave my key back and asked if I would be charged for the second night I booked if I left now, giving up on what I'd already paid for the first night. He said I wouldn't be charged, but when I got my credit card statement a month later I was there, charged for both nights. It didn't matter, I wouldn't stay there and wont go back. I felt unsafe. The room seemed cheap and dirty. I have traveled alone a LOT to Waikiki and surrounding areas but this was my worst experience.

Usually we do not have time to write reviews of places we have stayed at, but this time we feel we have to speak out of our experiences at the Equus. We had earlier browsed different hotel websites about this so-called boutique hotel where they comment positive about this place. Since there were just 2 options of rooms at the Marina Tower(city or ocean view), we booked a doble room, city view requesting one on a higher floor.But the whole truth dawned on us when we checked in....First of all, tower room city view is a “low-rated” standard room with a kitchenett, only up to 14th. floor, with no view at all. City veiw means neighbouring blocks looking right into your window!Secondly, the room was not very clean. The kitchenett drawers and cupboards were sticky and oily, so was the microwave...urrghhh! There was just one fork and a spoon(no knives at all), a very dented frying pan (looked like it was picked up from a rubbish dump), 2 small chipped saucers that were supposed to be plates??, and a coffee machine. Best of all, the toilet bowl was loose, such that when you sit on it, it wipped! We went down to complain, and was informed that they would send maintainence to look at it. Otherwise they would set in the utensils we needed in the kitchenette for our stay. We requested a change of room three days in a row, since we felt that the room we had was the worst in that block – microwave dirty and outdated, old TV, coffee machine leaked everytime you made coffee, windows could not be opened so it smelled musty etc..The 5 options we got were no better – all were just standard rooms with two single beds, only with more updated microwave and TV (flatscreen). And since they had no dobble rooms available, we were stuck with the one we had. What really got us was the attitude of the lady in charge at the reception – Renee- she was not at all nice, and told us that if we were not satisfied, we can just find ourselves another hotel! (We had booked and prepaid the room for 11 days at a hotelwebsite, so there’s no refund for us) So we decided to make the most of our stay there, and as the days passed, we noted all of the things that put this so-called boutique hotel on the “worst hotels” list. The room was not cleaned at all throughout the 11 days we were there.They only made up the bed, emptied the rubbish bin, and when they changed towels, the “new”towels had brown stains on them. Once they changed the over-sheet, and that too had 3 huge brownish stains on it! So we just folded it in two - we’d given up complaining.A coffee sachet was put in the room only on the first day. We were informed that if we wanted coffee, we had first to ring reception, who then sends housekeeping with a coffee sachet to us. This we had to do even when we asked for coffee while housekeeping was right outside the door! Terribly rigide rules.So... the ONLY positive thing about this hotel is it’s location, and the new girl “Mimie” at the reception. She understood our plight, and tried to do her best, but there was little she could do, being new and not having authority to make changes.So...to all fellow travellers – be warned.. don't beleive the photos and comments of the different websites concerning this hotel. Outside it looks very nice, but on the inside...... KEEP AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!","Oslo, Norway","TomandTina2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>",7,1.0

It was as expected. We stayed in the Marina Tower with a deluxe ocean view on a high floor. It is obviously an older building, but the rehab was well done. The room was clean and comfortable. The view was great. And the location was convenient between the Ala Wai canal and Waikiki Beach.The hotel is not located right on the beach. It is across Ala Moana Blvd, about a block away, but its an easy walk. The Waikiki strip, resort hotels, high end shops and restaurants, are about a twenty minute walk. (Beware: parking in the area is expensive and difficult) The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, but skip the continental breakfast, it is not worth the trouble.The room had a small kitchenette, although we only used the refrigerator. The built in cabinets throughout were older and not updated, the the floors and bathroom tiles were new. The king size bed was comfortable. The was a large, wall mounted flat screen TV with cable and high speed internet via ethernet.Check in was difficult. The front desk and lobby are located up one flight of stairs from the street level in the Equus building. We arrived with two large suitcases and carry ons which we dragged up the stairs to check in. We then dragged them down the stairs to head to our room in the tower building. It was inconvenient, but not a major drama.This is definitely not a luxury hotel like the Edition (located across the street) with rooms starting at $350 a night.

We did not stay in the main Equus building, but in the Marina Tower on the 38th floor. The view was absolutely amazing, and made any short comings of the room unimportant. Our room had a kitchenette, which was small but would be perfect for an extended stay. the fridge smelled terrible, and there were little bugs in it, but a word to the front desk and they cleaned it out right away. This was not such a big deal, because we didn't end up using it for anything. The room was shaped awkwardly, with the bed and computer desk squeezed into one side which made it hard to walk around. The bathroom was small but adequate, but the overall appearance made you think ""cheap remodel"". The bed was comfortable, and waking up to that view was so amazing. It is hard to think badly about the room with that view. And, you don't go to Oahu to stay in your hotel room so it is easy to write off the oddness of the room. This hotel is in an excellent location, right across the street from the marina and Waikiki beach. There are great restaurants in walking distance, and an ABC store on the same block which is great for a cheap breakfast.

'A boutique hotel'...i'm sure The Equus is, however The Marina Tower couldn't be more different.Basically, the accomodation consists of two locations. The Equus Hotel, and then just behind it The Marina Tower, which is also part of The Equus.I have copied the segment below from the hotels website........""With the addition of the Marina Tower, an award winning architectural landmark with glass elevators soaring 40 stories high, providing spectacular panoramic ocean views from many of its 136 guestrooms, the new Equus Hotel & Marina Tower is a stylish one-of-a- kind property located just steps from the world-renowned Waikiki Beach.""This is VERY MISLEADING. The 'sprinkling of Ralph Lauren inspired touches' does not exist in The Marina Tower.What they fail to mention is that the Marina Tower is very dated, and in much need of a complete makeover. IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ROOMS IN THE EQUUS!!!After looking at the website, i made the mistake of booking a room in The Marina Tower. I booked a room with two double beds, city view. On arrival we were told they had no rooms left with two double beds, that they only had a room with two single beds, but they had upgraded us to a Sea View. Not a problem..................until we entered the room.The best way i can think to describe the room is like a hostel. Something that you wouldn't mind paying £20 a night for. It had two tatty single beds, with a sheet on each and scummy looking pillows. Dated rotting wooden furniture, a yellow 'curtain' that would not keep any light out, and a lumpy old TV.I made my way back over to the Reception in The Equus and we were given keys to two other rooms to have a look at. We picked one of those, it was marginally better with a double bed and better curtains. It had a kitchenette that we didn't risk using as it just looked dirty, it smelt of damp, the walls in the bathroom were crumbling, and there were quite a few coackroaches!We had to endure a week here. The room was not cleaned, apart from the bin being emptied. By the 5th day we had to yet again go to Reception to ask for some clean towels and for the bed sheets to be changed and they stated it would be done the following day - it wasn't. BACK to reception to ask AGAIN, and two girls came to the room shortly after with some towels that smelt like they had been in a boiler room.The view was fantastic, but i didn't want to spend any time in the room to enjoy it.Some of the 'apartments' at Marina Tower are privately owned. Everytime i got in the lift there would be someone drunk out of their head and stinking of alcohol, at all times of day. Lets just say that some of the residents aren't societies most desirable people.All 3 washers and 2 dryers broke down whilst we were there.On the upside a free breakfast was provided over at The Equus which consisted of Melon, pastries, juice and coffee which was fine.Jackie who was the security/housekeeping lady was a very pleasant lady. She is an asset to The Equus and i hope they appreciate her. She deserves to work in a better environment and im sure would benefit from a lot more tips!The lady who provided the breakfast was also very pleasant.I tried not to let our stay ruin our time in Oahu, but i must admit i dreaded going back to Marina Tower each night to sleep.I will never stay again, even if it were in The Equus part of the hotel, as i feel in a way i have been conned out of my money.The location is good for Ala Moana Beach and Shopping Centre, close to buses/trolleys and not too far to Waikiki.",London,"Sazzle_funk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",79,1.0

But their website showed a nice room so I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I arrived at the hotel after driving a few times around the block because the entrance was difficult to find. When I checked in, I didn't get a room at the Equus but the Marina or whatever it was. We went the the room and it was nothing near the pictures on the web. The floor was greasy and it smelled like someone was cooking with oil in the room. There was no bath tub. Just a tiled shower room. I was grossed out and just stayed there one night and moved to another hotel. The sheets were stained so I had to use a towel to cover the stained area before getting into bed. I guess I couldn't expect much for the price, but this was a room that would be on my never want to visit list. Lesson learned -- When you read the reviews, they are true. If you just want a cheap place to stay and don't mind the greasy floors and outdated and unkempt rooms, then this is the place to be. If you want a reasonably clean place to stay, then don't even consider it. I'm glad I made the move. I didn't even want to ask them why they didn't have a room in the Equus because the other reviews I read are all similar. Book the Equus and get a room in the Marina.I don't recommend this place to anyone. The website said it had free wi-fi but it didn't. It didn't even have a hair dryer.

The so called breakfast consists of bread and some fruits. That is all! It is also only served from 7.30-8.30 am. Anyway, it is not worth going there anyway.
