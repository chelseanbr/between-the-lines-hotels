When we checked in we were advised we had been allocated a high floor room on the pool side of hotel but what we were not told is renovations were being carried out so our view was of the painters working on a swinging stage right outside our room. We had to keep our curtains closed at all times and the only ones to enjoy our balcony were the painters who used it for their lunch venue. The room was old and outdated with the smallest shower we have ever seen. What really surprised us was we were on the elite level of the hotel but anyone who has ever stayed at a Marriott property would realise there is nothing elite about what is provided here. My advice is if you are thinking of booking for your honeymoon or first trip to Hawaii stay somewhere else. We paid around 300 aud per night but for what we got would have been disappointed paying half that.,,PJPP1,0,1.0

This was our first trip to Hawaii and we came to Oahu to see Pearl Harbor and to check out Waikiki. I'll keep this review targeted to the hotel itself. Location - not bad. it sits about a 3-4 blocks from the beach, but is convenient to all of the restaurants. There's no ""resort fee"", which is a good thing, because this is NOT a resort. This is a hotel in a crowded city.Amenities - The hotel does have a small bar, small swimming pool that doesn't get much sun given the area buildings around it. We did get a couples massage at the onsite ""spa"" and both of us thought that they were very good.Staff - The front desk staff was excellent and very friendly.Rooms - This is where the review takes a turn for the worse. First of all the rooms were extremely small. I mean tiny! The shower was so tiny that I could barely even get in it. Perhaps they have other layouts with more room. We didn't have any issues with the room not being clean. Our room was on the 12th floor facing west basically looking into the hotel/condo across the street. The biggest problem was the noise. You could hear everything. They did provide ear plugs, but you could hear doors shutting/slamming all night. Both nights, we were woken up at 3:00-4:00 am to people screaming and yelling in the street below. One evening, a lady was screaming for over an hour at people passing by. My wife notified the front desk who apparently had no idea. They did call the police and the lady was asked to leave.Unfortunately, if ever in the area again, I would not stay here. It was too noisy and there was no way to get a good nights rest.","McKinney, Texas","jrm4013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McKinney, Texas</strong>",23,3.0

You can generally expect a certain level of quality from standard hotel brands such as Courtyard, but this felt a lot more like staying in your uncle's old beach condo that desperately needs repairs and updating. When I was younger, I stayed in some real dumps in Waikiki, but at least those places didn't have the audacity to charge resort-like rates like the Courtyard. I stayed in the tower further back on the property, and like a lot of beachy hotels here, the doors to the rooms led directly outside. While this is not unique to the Courtyard, that doesn't make this ""feature"" any less annoying. It means you hear the street noise, and there is a LOT of it--trucks and buses going up and down the side streets, garbage trucks coming by at 4:30 in the morning, late night revelers, etc. My room looked out onto a abandoned lot surrounding by chain link fence and filled with overgrown grass and weeds. The room itself was run down and outdated, with a wall-mounted a/c unit that didn't take the moisture out of the air. The bathroom had a stained tub and no fan, just a window that would open a crack, adding to the humidity in the room. The sink and countertop in the bathroom were comically small. The taps in both sinks were installed so close to the edge of the sink that it was impossible to wash your hands without creating a lake on the bathroom or kitchenette counter. On the service side, they failed to make up our room two days in a row. Had to call down to get them to bring us fresh towels and ask them to service the room. When they did clean the rooms, they didn't do a very good job, often failing to replace amenities and wipe down parts of the bathroom. When I tried to call for late checkout on my last morning, I called the front desk 3 times with no answer. The only positive was the pool and hot tub area. It was relatively secluded and a nice amenity. The lobby is nice, but who spends time in a hotel lobby in Hawaii? The location also was pretty good, but you can walk to everywhere from everywhere in Waikiki, so you don't really get any points for that. Book elsewhere.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Alanwk85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",1,1.0

Online booking & check/in went smoothly as expected for a 2 room booking. It went downhill from there. I moved to 3 different rooms to escape a cat litter-like reek throughout the Kuhio side of the hotel. Both rooms’ bathrooms had old stains, hair, small insects and mold. The hallway outside my room was mostly blocked with cleaning carts, equipment and stacks of garbage every night when I returned to my room. Given the prominence of the Coronavirus outbreak and the huge Asian tourism traffic, the absence of basic hygiene practices inspired very little confidence.My room also was noisy and was clearly not updated with proper outlets etc needed for working in the room. Connectivity issues forced me to work in the very small lobby area throughout my stay. The valet parking staff was shockingly reckless & flippant. One one occasion despite short warning honks, we only avoided being hit by quickly reversing out of a Valet’s path. When speaking to the valet, 4 young valets were dismissive and laughing as we explained the dangerous behavior. When we tried to speak to the hotel manager, he was off and after a long wait, the acting manager finally showed up & said he’d “speak” to the valets. In my view, reckless speeding in a small parking lot should be taken seriously - even if you’re a young man who is intent on being cool to your peers.The front desk staff was very nice & tried to be helpful throughout the terrible stay, but time and time again we got conflicting information about what the platinum food & beverage credit covered & didn’t cover which was frustrating and stressful every single day. When I checked out, they finally resolved all of the various daily food credit issues which was ultimately a relief but the confusion and constantly changing criteria was unnecessary and an unpleasant daily adventure.The bartenders were wonderful and friendly - consistently. The pool area was small with very minimal direct sunlight and the smallest threadbare towels I’ve ever seen. The location is walkable to almost everywhere but do not expect to have access to any beach front facilities other than those for the general public. I may have to stay here again for business & I really hope they take this review seriously and up their game because the totality of the experience was very negative.","McLeod Ganj, India","liulibby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McLeod Ganj, India</strong>",4,1.0

An executive room was small (as my picture will verify) with a tiny bathroom and shower. There was only a desk chair to sit it. If you don’t care about being by the beach and only want to sleep and shower then it is ok. I did not really hear noise in the hotel but you get street noise and it is windy higher up.

We got another room in another building and although it wasn't great, at least it wasn't mouldy. Don't get me wrong, it was barely a step up from a motel.

This is a real shame as this could be so much better.Note to management - your exterior painters aren’t doing a great job. There were sections missed on our balcony which looks very poor.The staff are very friendly and the rooms are clean, but this is now a very noisy hotel. There are a few reasons for this I could see. 1. The lift has a pointless tone as it goes up each floor and you hear this ALL night. 2. People seem to come and go all hours in the corridors and the rooms aren’t well insulated.On a side note - the room we had booked had a kitchenette - but no cutlery or plates which isn’t good.I haven’t written this hotel off yet but I won’t stay here again until I saw an effort to address maintenance and noise.If you book here, ask for a quiet room away from the lift (main hotel building), that may give you a night’s sleep.",,AdventureTimeNZ,0,2.0

The traffic was crazy and we had a rental car. Didn’t know we had the valet park, enter on the west side of the block at back of hotel. Beware! They charge $45 per night to park! I couldn’t believe it! The pool area out back was nicely sheltered by creative landscaping. The hotel somehow did not have our room reserved and we arrived at 7:30 pm. They gave us the only room left, luckily it was an upgrade to a suite on 15th floor. On the night table was complementary set of earplugs. I thought that was curious and humorous. As it turned out by 5:30 in the morning there was no doubt why they provided them. Between motorcycles going down the road and sirens it was impossible to get a thorough nights sleep.The hotel showed signs of having been renovated from a very old hotel. Don’t get me wrong, it was nice but it revealed by things like hooks on the back of the bathroom door that were from a bygone era. Everything else was acceptable.With the congestion, the traffic, the people, the noise, this better be the Hawaii you’re counting on.

It’s great location doesn’t make up for all that it’s lacking including:1. Strong mildew stench in my room which could be a health hazard. I could hear sounds of dripping water in my room, not sure where that came from..... could be the cause of mildew2. Outdated and flawed room interiors - the wooden toilet door has cracks/spilts, balcony was filthy and looked rusty, shower was extremely small (I hit my head a few times when I tried to pick up stuff from the floor. I am a 5’3 size 2 female), extremely small sink3. Amenities - no complimentary bottled water provided. And they provide tiny bottles of shampoo and conditioner, plus tiny bar of soap for body (no shower gel)4. Lighting - there was no lighting in the doorway and shower. Other in-room lighting (3 table lamps and 2 reading lights) were white lights, not warm lights which were very odd. Don’t expect dimmers as well.5. Extremely unprofessional housekeeping staff - I was pressured by its housekeeping staff to vacate the room for cleaning at 11am because she had a lot of checkouts today. 5. Poor housekeeping - shower was not cleaned at all, I could see soap suds and leftover conditioner on the floor.6. Tiny outdated pool, which looked like a flashback to the 80s7. No detergent dispenser / vending machine in its laundry room. You are required to bring your own. Although the washer/dryer machines are supposed to accept credit card payment, it doesn’t work.8. Poor sound proofing - I could hear people walking up and down the walkway and people hanging out in the pool even at 10pm.Pls don’t spend your money on this property!

I was told no kings were available but my “upgrade” would give us a larger room. After I agreed (key word here is “after”) I was told the “upgraded” room was in another building off the back of the hotel. We proceeded to walk to the other building to find what was obviously an old hotel building, likely built as another low end hotel before being aquired by the Courtyard and hastily painted over to resemble a Courtyard brand. The out building was 12 stories with a single elevator (more on that later), 1 ice machine, and a dime sized pool. We were treated to a lovely view of an empty lot littered with mounds of trash and garbage. The walls were paper thin and we enjoyed hearing every word of every conversation from every room above us, belowus, and next to us. We heard every shower, every toilet flush, and every footstep rang through our room as if intentional. We were treated to a massive f-bomb laden argument in the room above us, and of course other “night sounds” if you catch my drift. Appropriate for the no-tell motel, not a Marriot Courtyard.The keys did not work after our first night and We had to have them reprogrammed, a 20 minute round trip “commute” to the main building where folks actually seemed to have a more Marriot like experience unlike us second rate people “out back.”On night 2 the elevator went out of service. We trudged up 7 floors to get to our rooms on an injured foot for the next two days.

Internet in the rooms is also very slow with no option for faster service for gold or higher elite members.As one might expect in a city hotel, rooms are small as are the bathrooms. The tiny showers have doors that don't seal around the edges (most likely to avoid mold getting a foothold), but this means quite a lot of mopping up is needed after a shower. We got to laying down a full size bath towel in addition to the shower mat to soak up all the water. Noise from other guests - particularly slamming doors at all hours - is a problem as well. All parking here is valet only and costs $45/day, but service is not commensurate with these charges. One morning we came out for our vehicle and waited for the better part of half an hour as they'd misplaced it amongst the various lots and garages that they squirrel away vehicles at night. Once they found it, there was an additional delay as the valet had to come back had to get the keys to move several other vehicles that were parked in front of it before he could extricate it. However, our real problems came after we left. Even though we'd presented the credit card that we wanted our room billed to upon our arrival, we discovered that they'd only billed that card for about 20% of our bill. The rest of the bill went on the card we keep on file with Marriott to guarantee reservations. No where on there website when one books a room here, nor when we checked, etc. were we told that they had charged a ""deposit"" for this non-prepaid reservation. We had to call credit card companies, Marriott's Platinum Elite line, and the hotel to get the problem looked into - we even had to fill out and fax a form to the hotel. A form by the way that authorized whoever got it to make third party charges to our card which seemed very strange - we were looking for a refund, not more charges on the wrong card! It took several days to finally get things straightened out at our expense (calls and faxes to Hawaii aren't cheap and our time is valuable).

This hotel does have some draw backs as any place does. It tends to be a little noisy, but its in the middle of Waikiki on a busy street...what do you expect? For me its not a complaint as I have seen from other reviews, rather a heads up to anyone reading this and is curious. Another draw back is the parking price, I think $45 a day is insane to be honest...that is a compaint! I suppose since this hotel does not have a resort fee, the parking is sort of a wash. All in all this hotel is a great place to stay and I will continue to stay here because of the staff first and foremost, and of course as the title states...location location location!","Santa Rosa, California","evil-G-nius</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa, California</strong>",16,5.0

The rooms are modernized and upgraded, and they include a patio in most rooms in the main towers. The price is unbeatable for the amenities and cleanliness this hotel affords. There is an amazing pool, a 24/7 gym, a bar, restaurant, concierge, and gift shop all on the property. The hotel staff at the bar and front desk were great. Very hospitable and accommodating. We were recommended a Thai restaurant across the street (separate review) which was an amazing recommendation. The staff was so polite and pleasant despite being clearly busy with all of the guests each time we were near the front desk and in the bar. They really deserve a shout out for exemplary customer service and living up to the Marriott name. A few side notes for additional information:Parking- ~$45 USD PER NIGHT. They only have valet. With the price of a rental car, plus gas, plus tip, plus the parking- that’s an expense I’m glad I skipped. My wife and I chose to Lyft everywhere because we were planning on sticking near Waikiki, only venturing off to the Pearl Harbor Memorial, the Ala Moana Center, and of course the airport. It was well worth it, and I guarantee we spend less than the parking fees alone for 5 nights. Happy hour in the bar- 3-6 and 9-12. The best part about the bar (besides the great service) was the operating hours and happy hour. It was refreshing to see a pool side bar open until midnight in a hotel. It was great. (The pool hours ended at 10pm, however). Hospitality- late check out was not a problem at all, and the front desk will hold your bags for you after checkout if you have a later flight, so that you can enjoy your last day on the island sans carrying a bunch of items. They also offer a hospitality room from ~2-5 pm to shower and get cleaned up if needed before your flight on the day you check out. They were so friendly and accommodating, that I would stay again for just that reason - 5 star customer service. Concierge- we did not book anything through the concierge. We did have a chat and visit, yet the value didn’t seem to be there. ($400 for a luau?)It was not a hard-sale and the gentlemen were very nice, but there are cheaper options if you do some research on local activities and events. However, if you want to utilize them they are always there which is great. Pool- just fantastic. Nothing more needs said. Distance- everyone’s biggest concern. Easy walking distance from all of the Waikiki shops, restaurants, beaches. Seriously, a short 5-10 minute walk which gives you the opportunity to see many options. Overall, if I travel to Waikiki again, the Courtyard Marriott will be my hotel of choice. I highly recommend it.

First, I understand that everything in Hawaii is very expensive and there is a need to cut costs. Our room was reasonably priced for what we got, so that's why I'm giving an ""average"" rating to this property. But this property does not offer standard amenities Marriott loyalists expect from Courtyard properties.The lack of free lobby coffee is absurd. And only providing one coffee pod per day in the room is ludicrous for a business hotel where people need to wake up jet-lagged for work. I was really surprised that there was no breakfast at the hotel and the $20 daily credit provided to us as Marriott Platinum Elites didn't buy much in the hotel pantry or affiliated restaurant located in the same building as the main hotel.The rooms are very small, but I understand this is a densely-populated area so that's understandable. But I still don't think this should be branded as a ""Courtyard by Marriott."" The internet in our corner room was very spotty. I would be able to stream baseball for about 45 minutes just fine, then it would be 45 minutes of little to no bandwidth for 45 minutes and that constantly went back and forth.The gym was on par or better than the bare minimum you would expect from a Courtyard. The valet parking system was as efficient as it could be in that dense area. The two elevators (and sometimes one) were not really enough to keep up with 18 floors of guests. If you need to be on time to meetings, consider staying on a low floor.The balcony was very enjoyable. The room had a pretty good number of plugs. The air conditioning was extremely powerful. The staff were all exceedingly professional and pleasant, which I know isn't easy in a full hotel during peak season. The location was convenient to Waikiki, the highway, and downtown. Housekeeping staff were diligent and kept the room very clean.It wasn't a bad stay, but this property doesn't deserve to be a Courtyard by Marriott and should be branded something lower. All the staff were professional and polite, but still, I would not stay here again in the future.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","ewstuber</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",171,3.0

The young woman at the registration desk smiled and told us they had upgraded our standard room for a “Corner Junior Suite.” That sounded pretty good. We went through the check-in process then she told us we’d have to walk across the parking lot in the rain to a building in another area. We schlepped all our luggage and with a little difficulty found our junior suite on the second floor of that building. As we entered, we immediately noticed a musty odor. Not a good beginning! The suite was basically the size of an average room, it just had more walls so there was a sitting area. The bathroom and bedroom were very small. The sitting area modest in size. The furniture, carpet and bedding were stained. Right below our bedroom window was a small pool with lots of activity going on. (Our body clocks said it was 2am. Honolulu was 8pm.) The following morning there appeared to be garbage pickup somewhere in the parking lot around 6am. A little later, on the street side, there was a large truck that continued to back up causing the beeping sound, then finally picked up a dumpster of junk…All the while making an extraordinary amount of loud noises. We went downstairs to the coffee shop for breakfast and when we returned to our “suite” there was some kind of construction going on just outside…drilling, sawing, banging. On the brighter side, the woman who checked us in was very friendly and easy to work with. The bartender at the lobby bar was delightful. The waitress at the coffee shop couldn’t have been nicer.Conclusion: We will never return to the Courtyard Waikiki Beach. We probably will never go to another Courtyard anywhere.

You have to admire them for their honesty in that regard. Even more impressive are the staff here at all levels. While Hawaii is famous for the ""aloha spirit"" and you notice it everywhere you go, the staff here take it up one notch. They're extremely friendly and go out of their way to help guests. This is especially impressive given the facility they have to work with. The Courtyard consists of two substandard buildings constructed in the 1960s and operated for many years as the budget Ohana Waikiki Surf and its even cheaper Waikiki Surf East. The latter is now the Courtyard's Royal Hawaiian Tower and, despite its majestic name, is a 14 story building with one elevator and catwalk access to rooms! The main building has two good elevators and most of the rooms have narrow interior corridor access. The rooms themselves range from dismal tiny chambers smelling of mold and mildew to more spacious options. While there are opaque draperies over the main window, corner rooms have side windows covered by semi-translucent shades that late-sleepers may find problematic. And while the hotel has been renovated many times over the years, the lack of double-glazed windows is most unfortunate given that this hotel is on one of the noisiest corners in Waikiki. The microwave and refrigerator are very handy, but other amenities are limited to soap, shampoo and conditioner. Every day your ration is one single-serve packet of regular coffee and one decaf. Should two guests stay in the room and both prefer regular coffee, you'll have to request that, I suppose. So, all in all, if you're looking for a hotel with a great location, fantastic staff and no resort fee, this Courtyard is the answer.

It is a good location and walkable to a lot of places in Waikiki Beach. The staff were generally friendly, if not always completely competent. My room wasn't ready when I arrived.

Good thing I didn't actually wait for a call. I was recognized for my Marriott Titanium Elite status, but there was really no upgraded rooms. There is apparently no view from any room. The corner suite I booked was already the largest room. The hotel was clearly something else before it was a Courtyard. It has none of the standard Courtyard look and feel. I stayed in the tower across the parking lot from the main building. There is only one elevator for the whole building (12 floors). I noticed a lot of people using the stairs. I wasn't too inconvenienced by the issue, but I could see if being a problem if that tower was fully occupied. The room desperately needed a renovation. Lots of worn and peeling paint, dated furniture and decor. And the shower was a weird dark cave of a nook in the bathroom. The room didn't seem dirty, but it was old enough to make you wonder. The view I had from the 4th floor was a trash strewn lot across the street in one direction, and an apartment building with balconies in the other direction. It was inexpensive, but it should be under these conditions.

The main reason for choosing this again was the same: Easy access to the Hawaii Convention Center via TheBus in front of the hotel, and short walking distance to Kalakaua Ave / Waikiki Beach. I had selected a Guest Room with a King Bed this time, because I wanted more amenities, namely a larger mini-refrigerator and a microwave oven. Arrived early, and the polite & courteous staff had my luggage stored until official check-in time, requesting a higher floor room facing away from Kuhio Ave, due to noise issues. I was a bit surprised to learn that hotel actually has two towers, one on Kuhio Ave, and the other just a bit Northeast, on Royal Hawaiian Ave., since I was assigned a room in the latter (I had previously stayed in the main hotel tower). A short walk from the valet station, following yellow footprint markers on the driveway, took me to the correct location. I was initially disappointed with my room assignment, since it appeared to be a much older building that had undergone heavy renovation, the view out of the balcony overlooked a empty (Government Property) lot with some junk in it, and some very loud sanding / drilling construction noise coming from the condo complex across the street. Thankfully, the room was very clean, the refrigerator far larger in capacity than the ""Cozy Studio"" room I previously stayed in, the walk-in shower's water got hot immediately (still very claustrophobically small), and the construction noise stopped at 5 PM (did not continue for the rest of the weekend). Overall, despite the apparent age of the building, it actually was a better room experience than my previous stay.The ice machine was located on the 2nd floor (just outside the elevator), and apart from the one time where there was a bit of a traffic jam with several of cleaning staff (their station is right next to the machine), it was a lot easier to get to than the main tower one. However, for the 1st floor room whose patio area is overlooked by ice machine balcony, there might be a lot of noise and lack of privacy issues because of it.Did not eat at the on-site restaurant nor coffee shop, and the gift shop was about the same as those on Lewers St. Did not use the small pool near the tower elevator as well. Availability of the hotel computers in the lobby business center was very helpful.All in all, if there is another future convention in town that I'll be attending, I'm sure I'll be back, because this property was a good balance between an affordable clean stay, and location","Seattle, Washington","Khyron82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",82,4.0

I was in town for just two nights. I selected the Courtyard Waikiki Beach for several reasons: 1) Great location, 2) Competitive Price, 3) Marriott Rewards, and 4) Courtyard quality. I like Courtyard properties for their standard amenities, convenient locations, clean properties, and ease of getting in and out. Unfortunately, this visit to the Courtyard Waikiki Beach fell short of those expectations.I arrived late (11:30P) on a Saturday night from the mainland. I had checked in on my Mobile App and stopped by the Front Desk to pick up my keys. It took the associate a few minutes to find my keys before I was headed to my room (907). When I opened the door, I noticed a strong musty/moldy odor. Given the late hour, I decided to increase the A/C and try to ignore it because I was exhausted. Unfortunately, the odor didn't subside, and it made for a restless night and scratchy eyes.The next morning, I stopped by the Front Desk before I left for the day. I asked them to have Housekeeping address the odor and do whatever they needed to ""refresh"" the room. I returned that evening at about 9:30P to discover the odor was as strong as ever. I went back down to the Front Desk and asked them to send Housekeeping to my room. When the Housekeeping associate arrived with a bottle of Febreeze, he quickly assessed the situation and told me there was nothing he could do. He told me he would notify the Front Desk, and I should expect a call shortly.I stuck around my room for another hour before I called down to the Front Desk to find out what was going on. Unfortunately, the associate at the Front Desk claimed to have not heard anything from Housekeeping and was unaware of my predicament. At that time, I requested a room transfer. At first, the associate told me nothing was available in my room class, but then she was able to find a comparable room (856)in their Royal Hawaiian Tower at the rear of the property.I quickly accepted the room change, packed up my things, and headed down to the Front Desk. When I arrived at the Front Desk, it once again took a few minutes for the associate to find my new keys. Apparently, it was another communication failure between associates - a common theme for my stay.Luckily, my new room was what I expected from the start from the Courtyard. The room was clean, and much fresher and quieter than my first room. My only surprise with the new room was the size of the bathroom. Anyone larger than 6ft tall may find the shower claustrophobic.I would give the property 2.5 stars, if possible, because I ultimately got a clean room for my last 12 hours in the city. However, I don't think I should have had to go through all the trouble to ""manage"" the associates. Had I not stayed on top of things, nothing would have happened.Would I stay at the Courtyard Waikiki Beach for my next visit to Honolulu?Unfortunately, I must say it is highly unlikely.PROs: Location, PriceCONs: Noise, Temperamental Elevator, Lack of Attention to Detail","Atlanta, Georgia","371ricardoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",4,2.0

Our room was located in the another building separate from the Check-in area, we thought it wasn't even a part of the hotel. We walked over to the building where our room was located and it felt like a motel rather than a Marriott property. The building is very old, elevator makes noises and closes on you if you aren't fast enough. Our room itself wasn't too bad but you could hear noises from outside the room very easily. Water pressure from the sink and shower was weird and I felt like every time I washed my hands I got water all over the sink. Now this hotel was decent but for the price you pay it's ridiculous. I'm surprised not more people complain about it. They really need to make some changes or stop using that second building we were in.

We were put in lower floors, all we see is buildings right in front of our nose or a junk yard that hands can reach and of cause noise. No sky at all.Anyway, it was not my first choice if my sister didn’t ask for a low budget room.

The bathroom was ample with a shower over a low bath and a good sized sink area but it could do with an extra towel rail or two and possibly even a small clothes line to hang wet things like swimming costumes, and a shelf underneath the vanity. The air conditioning was quiet and effective, both in the living area and the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable, not too hard, not too soft. Being in the heart of Waikiki, traffic and people noise is to be expected. Consideration could be given to mitigating this by installing double glazing in the living area and the bedroom. Also, as I like to sleep without light coming into the room, pelmets could be considered for the top of the curtains. This hotel is opposite ihop restaurant which stays open 24 hours a day. This together with the bar next to ihop, means that there is sometimes noise from people in the street very late at night. Again, double glazing would help here. The staff at this hotel are very pleasant and very responsive to requests. We were initially given a suite which was not suitable due to the bedroom not being able to be closed off, and the staff responded in a positive manner by moving us to a more suitable suite as soon as one became available. A good alternative if you do not want to pay big dollars for a good standard of accommodation and you don't mind not being on the beach. It's only minutes to walk to Waikiki Beach. There was a partial water view in the distance from our balcony which was accessible via the living area as well as the bedroom. Four chairs and a table were provided on the balcony.

There is a back building which is not as bad but poorly updated and cheaply done. Especially the bathroom with old thin windows with rust and mold inside the frame. It is amazing what they charge based on their brand but you will not find the standard quality you would expect at a Marriott Courtyard. There are much nicer hotels in the same price range along the strip.The worst rub is that this property charges $45 a night to park there and the Ritz Carlton across the street charges only $35 a night. Hard to get into the property with your car on top of it.

When I hear the word “Courtyard”, I think new, I think modern. Talk about the total opposite. LOCATION:Terrific spot as they’re centrally located but more on the western half of Waikiki where all the action is, including the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, International Market Place and Waikiki Yokocho. Right across the street sits an IHOP and ABC Store too. ATMOSPHERE:Don’t look for a grand entrance as there is none, really. Instead, enter into the parking lot on one-way Royal Hawaiian Avenue with the confusing sign that states “valet only”. Pull up to the temporary desk under the tarp – that’s the valet desk. Yikes. Upon entering the low ceiling lobby, you’ll be greeted by the hotel’s sole bar, pool, Kimobean Coffee shop, business center, front desk and Pure Spa. Spada, an Italian restaurant, is located on the corner of Royal Hawaiian & Kuhio Avenues. ROOM:The hallway leading to the rooms are illuminated with super bright white lights. Entering the room, I could smell that it’s old. Nothing offensive but not refreshing either. Square footage was small compared to today’s standards, though the balcony that overlooked Kuhio Avenue was pretty large with chairs and a table. Because we were on the fifth floor along Kuhio Avenue, there was a little bit of noise from the street & sidewalk but nothing that woke us up. The ductless a/c unit was nice and cold but one of the vanes were missing which resulted in cold air blowing onto our heads in bed, forcing us to sleep upside down. Bedding and pillows were comfortable. Room amenities included a mini fridge, bar-style sink, coffee maker and bedside sound machine that sounded more annoying than soothing. BATHROOM:It was a tight squeeze, especially in the shower. If you’re big, you’ll be bumping into the walls constantly. Water pressure & drainage were good. Shampoo and conditioner were Paul Mitchell-branded. There is a hair dryer that was stored in the room’s closet. PARKING:A whopping $42/night. I try to avoid renting a car due to this reason but we needed a vehicle for luggage storage due to a late flight.POOL:They did a pretty good job with replicating a tropical setting regardless of its parking lot location. It’s a city hotel-sized pool with an attached hot tub. Seating is limited.  BUSINESS CENTER:Around five desktop computers are available for use with an access code. The sole copier/printer was out of service but I was able to forward my document to the hotel’s email address which was printed by the front desk. SERVICE:The agent who checked us out was friendly and efficient. Valet service was quick as the parking lot is right there. OVERALL:Comfortable and great location.

Bathroom was rather small, and as many have already commented, the walk-in shower even smaller (it took a long time for the water to heat up... But with humid conditions of August in Honolulu, having cold showers wasn't that bad). Bed was comfortable and clean, but with such thin sheets, the A/C nearby sometimes made sleeping a bit too cool for comfort. Noise-wise, I could hear my neighbors on both sides of my room, and while I wasn't on the Kuhio Avenue side of the building, my side had its share of street sounds for early morning wake-up calls. Did not use the pool, spa, nor the restaurant (see below). Ice machine is located on the 2nd floor (you have to take the South hallway door, and go outside to use the machine). While the Lobby level areas appeared to be quite new, and the hotel rooms quite clean, the place does have a bit of a ""in need of refurbishment"" feel to it, as many have said.Now, an explanation of why I gave this hotel 5 Stars, instead of 3 or 4:I originally was in Waikiki for a convention, which unfortunately ended up getting cancelled on the day the approaching Hurricane Lane was downgraded into a tropical storm. My main reasons for choosing this hotel (apart from being a Marriott property) was the easy bus access to the Hawaii Convention Center, as well as close proximity to the Waikiki shops, restaurants, and beaches, and the reasonable hotel rates (with auto club discount). Upon arrival, the check-in staff was completely up front about the hotel services that would not be available because of the approaching hurricane, mainly no housekeeping for 2 days and the on-property restaurant closed until further notice, out of concern for the safety of the employees. All pool furniture was stored away, and my room's balcony chairs and table were also moved inside (next to my bed). In the lobby, there was a bulletin board explaining the current status of the approaching storm, and until the day after the hurricane warning was lifted, printed-out storm updates were slipped under my door every morning. Watching from my balcony, I saw one of the staff doing a visual check from the ground level to see if any furniture was still out on the upper floors (which could become dangerous debris in a hurricane). I also noticed that the properties surrounding this hotel had a lot of their balcony furniture still out on the windward sides of the buildings... All in all, I was very impressed with the way the hotel staff put safety first during this storm situation, and kept us visitors informed.","Seattle, Washington","Khyron82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",82,5.0

This has to be the worst Courtyard Marriot I've ever stayed at and I've always been happy with this chain of hotels. Noise - The hotel is VERY NOISY!. It seems that there was not effort at all to make this hotel at least soundproof to a certain extent. I am on the fourth floor and I can hear each and every car, truck, bus that goes through and the traffic runs all night!. I saw ear plugs in the room and that should have been a sign but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and used them. Even with the ear plugs, you still can hear a lot of traffic noise. I had requested well in advance for higher floors but when I got here my room supposedly on the 10th floor was not going to be ready until after 6:00pm. Online when I checked in through the app, it said room will be ready at 4:00pm. It wasn't. So for those of us who cross 5 time zones to be here, you can be sleep deprived at night because of the noise level.Comfort - The hotel beds are average in comfort but the rooms and bathrooms are small and the showers are extra small. Service - I had to get the housekeeping folks to bring supplies like lotion etc. on 2 occasions. The front desk does not have a concierge and so any question you have or info I need, I had to join the line and wait with checkin customers. Also on several occasions, the staff didn't seem to know the answers, so I had to figure out myself and for a location such as this one, they should be a well staffed concierge that is familiar with the area to help tourists.Facilities - The pool is small and is next to the street and has again plenty of street noise I left other hotels for a slightly higher rate of about $50, I could have gotten a far much better hotel on Waikiki beachfront.This Marriot disappoints","Nashville, Tennessee","Msafiri1961</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",11,2.0

After reading all the reviews on this website I decided to book here once again because it offered the best deal at a great rate when compared to other hotels in the area around Kuhio and Lewers. On check in I was upgraded to the block at the rear of the hotel. My room was essentially a small apartment (which I’m positive it was at one time). I thought it was very compact, but certainly big enough for me travelling on my own. I can see how larger people might complain about the size of the shower and lack of bathroom shelf space, but compared to hotels in Europe and parts of Asia it was generous. My balcony overlooked a side street and a vacant block, but that was fine with me. All the positives... lobby staff are very pleasant. I know because I had to have my room keys reprogrammed four times while I was there. All the staff I met coming and going are delightful and greeted me every time I encountered any of them. There are two pools. One is a heated “therapy” pool that is rarely used and the second is a very pleasant pool but is totally shaded all afternoon. The pool towels are threadbare, but no one is there to monitor how many you use and whether you return them. The upside of staying in the back block is that it is much quieter than the rooms situated on Kuhio that I see lots of others complaining about on here. The wifi worked well for me and did everything I needed without resorting to contacting the tech support people. The valet parking is obviously very expensive, that is easy to work out by the number of staff working there. Why anyone feels the need to hire a car in Waikiki escapes me as the public bus system is more than adequate for transport. Traffic in Honolulu is crazy, so I feel little sympathy for anyone who then complains how expensive the valet parking is at any of these Waikiki hotels. There are no beach views. If you want a beach view I suggest you stay closer to the beach and pay for it. I like this hotel because of its proximity to the bus system which takes you pretty much anywhere most tourists want to go on Oahu and all for $5.50 per day.

I read numerous reviews prior to my stay taking into consideration the concerns about the small restrooms and noise. Prior to my stay Dave Villanueva sent emails showing much aloha spirit. It seemed as though they would be very accommodating. When I checked in I found they had upgraded me. A gift was also provided to me. This was extremely thoughtful. I was pleasantly surprised at the upgrade I received I’ll be at the noise from facing Kuhio Street. The bathroom was just perfect for me. The bed was extremely comfortable. There were some downsides to my stay that I find it important to address. The bathtub and shower curtain have pubic cares that still had not been cleaned when it was time for me to depart on June 18th. Brought this to staff attention on several occasions but the pubic care remained. Prior to check in I was told that I would not have to check out and check back in again. However, I was locked out of my room on the third day of nice day and had to swipe another credit card. This happen again on the fifth night of my stay. I found this rather discouraging. The noise was unbearable from Kuhio Street. I called down to speak with EJay on my first night at approximately 10:00 PM. I was told a white noise machine would be placed in my room. I was also told that a manager would contact me the next day regarding my concerns. By the third night of my stay I still have not received the white noise machine nor had a manager contacted me. I found this disheartening given the friendly emails I have received prior to my stay. By the fourth night I finally spoke with Lorissa will ensure that the white noise machine was placed in my room. I did not appreciate the fact that Dave Villanueva Took time to send me an email stating that my three reservations have been combined in that I would not need to check in and out of my room, only to find out again by Dave himself that he needed to swipe my card for a third time. I requested him to contact me on three separate occasions but he would never leave a message on my room phone nor call my cellular phone. It took several attempts at speaking with staff members for him to finally acknowledge that I was trying to get in contact with him. It seemed that each time I would try and speak with him I would be told that he left early for the day. This happened on at least two occasions. The communication with management need some help. A customer should not have to go to the front desk to speak with staff more than twice in order to get us response for management. I found this extremely irritating in and acceptable.Overall, I found my stay to be quite pleasant. The location is amazing. It is only a few short blocks to the main strip -Kalakaua. You can get there from either Royal Hawaiian or Lewers St. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that in staying on Kuhio street there were quite a few eateries (Marakume Udon being my favorite). Nordstrom rack is also on Kuhio would share a space with Hyatt centric. I did my fair share of damage there. If you take Kuhio to Seaside you’ll find a Ross dress for less. I found a large assortment of items there too. If you enjoy smoothies like I do, you can find a Jamba Juice on the corner of Kuhio and Seaside. I would also recommend taking a stroll to “Japantown” located in the Waikiki shopping center at seaside and color color for a matcha and vanilla soft serve ice cream cone at Nana’s. It’s absolutely amazing!","San Diego, California","JetsettinDiva08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",31,3.0

Booked through booking.com but don’t necessarily think I got a bargain, if I did I certainly would not have paid any more. Room size was ok as was bathroom size but I think we got one of the better size rooms. The place used to be a motel I think as there was a studio kitchen in our room however there was no way of actually using it as there were no cutlery or plates dishes etc. despite there being a microwave. There was tea bags and coffee sachets and a coffee machine but no kettle and no coffee pods for the machine.Beds were rather hard but some people like that and cant please everyone I guess. Staff were fine though didn’t really have much contact with them other than checking in.Pool was nice, coffee was nice at the onsite coffee shop (Hawaiian coffee is gross). The location was good, near down and the beach. Bus stop outside the hotel, the pink line will take you to the nearest shopping centre for $2. Food in Hawaii is expensive in terms of eating out. The 8 days cost us the most amount I’ve ever spent on holiday and that was just in food and drink. If you are on a budget be careful. The whole service charge / tip thing is not my thing either but I understand it’s an American thing. Personally I like a final price to pay and then tip for good service where appropriate rather than it being an expectation. Wouldn’t return to this hotel and probably would return to Hawaii unless I was desperate for a holiday and it was a major bargain.","Melbourne, Australia","binsy46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",14,3.0

This was my first time booking a package which included air, hotel, and car rental. We booked a 7 night stay and were put in room 250 in the Royal Hawaiian tower.First off, the proximity from our room to the valet stand was convenient. Maybe too convenient. Our balcony, which was far too large than it needed to be (it was larger, if not equal size to our actual room), faced directly out to the parking lot. I was not upset about the view but if a room won for best valet/parking lot view, it would be this one. Secondly, ice machines are located on the 2nd floor making it not only convenient for us but for EVERYONE else. Our room was right next to the ice machine. I’m not talking same level, down the hallway, I’m talking right outside of our room. My husband and I are not the lightest of sleepers and can generally sleep through certain noises but from the sound of cars coming in and out of the lot and the ice machine going off, it was getting to be a bit much. But that’s definitely not all. The second floor just so happens to also be where the housekeeping storage is. Most days we were there, it sounded like the entire staff was up and about congregating next to our room, talking amongst each other loudly. I appreciate their enthusiasm but they should be mindful of their conversations they have and how everything can be heard from inside the rooms. There were also housekeeping carts outside our room almost all of the time. We felt like we had to constantly walk around them just to get to and from our room.I was shocked to not see a single hotel guest on the same floor as us. I did hear a couple one day go into room 251, adjacent to us, but never heard or seen them once after that. Perhaps they had the same issues but were smart to ask for another room. Aside from all noise related issues, the room itself was decent but the bathroom was minuscule. Our bathroom had no counter space. I couldn’t wash my face without the toilet paper getting soaked because water would trickle down my arm and the sink would be too short to catch any of it. The walk-in shower (I was expecting a bathtub) was crammed and had zero access to any light. It was like showering in a dark closet. Overall, if it wasn’t for the location and proximity to some of our favorite shops and restaurants, we would not come back. Parking is unnecessarily high ($42!) but I suppose it’s fair since they provide free WiFi (thank goodness!).Staff was very friendly. The valet staff particularly seemed to consistently go above and beyond.","San Diego, California","Kristina K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",0,2.0

We arrived to be placed in a 'bungalow"" building next to the Courtyard main tower building. It was unacceptable especially since we had to take our luggage on stairway to the room, had problems opening the door, and then saw a letter on the nightstand that stated the roof would be worked on during our week's stay there. This was in addition to a few unacceptable things in the room: no basin plug and loud air conditioner blowing right on the bed and terrible lighting. Because we had our tourist schedule to keep, after two nights' stay, we complained to the front desk. We were told they'd check to see if there was room availability in the tower building. We checked back and they did have a room on the 5th floor and we moved from the 'bungalow' room for the rest of our stay. The room was much better in the main building. The kicker is that on our last day, another letter appeared on the nightstand, that said their quarterly termite/pest maintenance in the room will happen 'tomorrow' and that the spraying would not affect our health. We had to ask for them to do this process after we checked out and they complied. We may not stay at another Courtyard by Marriott for a long time if again.

For us middle class travelers we are not going to spend $500 a night and not have money left for other things. We spend as little time possible in a hotel and rather see the sights around us. We are travelers, not settlers. This was reasonably priced $169 @night with two beds, a microwave, small fridge, wet bar and bathroom. It is located within a 5 minute walk of the famous Waikiki Beach without the crowds of the board walk and Kalakaua Ave, but they are at your toe tips if that’s your vibe. The clientele here were air crews, young folks and a few family. I’d say more adults than families. The best part are the amenities near by. A bus stop that runs all over the island outside your door. Not one but two 24 hour convenience stores across the street that stock anything you need and reasonable prices. $5.99 huge ham and cheese sandwiches, etc. An ihop across the street and McDonalds for the cheap fare. You are a block off of Lewers Street with exciting nightlife, restaurants of every flavor and size purse, and can get away from the crowds quickly if the rain pops up or it’s time to retreat. The people watching along Kalakaua Ave. and all the ritzy stores is always entertaining if you like crowds. Otherwise head to the beach and walk the boardwalk for a sunset drink and dine later. The front desk is exceedingly helpful and Shane the concierge is at the top of his game with spot on advice. From the time you walk in and smell the Ocean Mist aromatherapy you are spirited away to a great experience. The pool and hot tub were adequate and I noticed repairs were done quickly when the hot tub timer failed. Pool was open until 10 PM but we never stayed late enough to close it. The area’s only real Italian Restautant is attached to the hotel and a coffee shop breakfast bakery counter is on premise, but we like McDonalds and their Hawaiian spam dishes.CONS-Location. They bill themselves as the “Times Square” of Waikiki. You are in a concrete canyon that is the main thoroughfare of the beach front but no beach. Kneeling buses with their “beep-beep” and sirens racing by will make their presence known at all hours reverberating between the glass and concrete. The hotel acknowledges this and provides free ear plugs. (I bring my own ear phones and white noise generator to mask it all out.) The balconies give you a ringside seat to all the action. If you like quieter, try going higher (Elite club) or ask for a court yard side unit. Some pool revelry may be heard “I’m going back to room to get a condom” from some frolicking patrons, but after 10 PM things are generally quieter courtside. The tall buildings nearby block the sunrise and sunsets. Diamond Head is partially visible down Kuhio Street. I’m posting this for the record and hope it’s not a regular occurrence, but supposedly a tenant pulled the fire alarm at 3 AM and woke everyone up. Supposedly he was evicted but we’ll see if it is an on going problem if more people post here. The hot tub was small but we were patient and got in. Tub capacity seems to be a recurring problem at all of the resorts we stayed at in Hawaii. Note: Do not rent a car. You will pay $20 a night for parking and between the trolley, the bus, and tours, why stress over rush hour traffic 3-7 every day (really) when you are on vacation. All day adult bus fare is $5.25. Buses were clean and 20 min. apart with tracking apps. Tour Trolley about $26 per adult. Must see the Polynesian Cultural Center (all day with Luau and Breath of Ha theater). Dole plantation tour just because you get to see so much of the island. Must see Dukes surf legend on the beach at Waikiki. Top of Waikiki for nice sunset over view and top of the city viewing splurge. All in all, none of the negatives would keep me from coming back. The $500 we saved being off the beach was well spent elsewhere. Aloha! ",,toddw377,45,5.0

The room is clean and tidy and relatively modern looking. I don't have anything to compare it with, but had expected there would be robes and slippers provided for our use. There isn't. The tea/coffee maker has only one serve of coffee, and one sachet of creamer. For 2 people. No teaspoons or other cutlery. When we booked, I had asked for a softer mattress, but the one we got is very firm. The pillows have the problem they always do in hotels: lying on one is too low, but two are too high. They are happy for people to re-use towels, but don't really provide space to hang them to dry. The bathroom doesn't have an extraction fan, so gets very steamy and damp. The lighting isn't really adequate - there is a desk lamp and two bedside lamps, but no ceiling light. The shower is also quite dim, and only has a tiny shelf, with no hooks for hanging sponges. Toiletries are provided as promised, but only shampoo, conditioner, and bars of face and body soap. I ended up buying shower gel and body lotion. On the plus side, we had asked for a room a bit higher up, with a balcony and overlooking the pool, and we got that. It's not completely soundproof, but it's not too noisy.

Scrambled to find a decent room to crash after our arrival. Located in Waikiki on one of the main drags, it's not oceanfront, but it's a quick, less than ten minute walk for anybody in good to average physical condition. The reviews mentioning how far it is from the beach must be from the disabled, obese, and senior citizens? It was six blocks straight down the street. The building is old. (But to our surprise, most of the more upscale hotels in Waikiki are decades old. In fact, the skyline consists of predominantly very old condos and hotel sky rises. Very few built in the last three decades with modern architecture. It's like looking at a skyline from the 1970's) However, all the public areas and guest rooms were renovated with modern amenities, new carpet, and everything was in good repair. Very clean and no funky musky old old hotel odors.The only problem with room was that the door to the balcony couldn't be opened and was secured shut. After a 16 hour flight and months of cold and darkness, I was really looking forward to sitting on the balcony and having a cocktail.Wifi was fast and free. All employees we dealt with were great! Nightly rate was very reasonable for Hawaii. Only $160. No resort fee, either. Parking is difficult and expensive in Waikiki, with most hotel and garages charging $40-60 per 24 hours. However, it is possible not to fork this out. Take my advice...First thing, rent the smallest compact car you can get! There is free parking along the one plus mile Ala Wai Blvd -2 blocks from the hotel- if you can find a spot (except for Mon & Fri from 8:30am-11:30am) We did six out of seven nights. We always found a space that we couldn't have fit into had we had a mid-sized car. It's best to find a spot before 4-5pm and leave it there. Uber for short rides.You can also park for free on Monsarrat Ave, by the the zoo. You can walk about 15 blocks or Uber back for $5ish. Also, The Banyan Condo tower, a ten minute walk down the street, charges $20 per day and is about the cheapest garage there is. There is also free parking on Ala Moana Ave, by the park and Marina, about a mile away across the bridge from Hilton Hawaii Village. It is almost vacant of cars after 9pm. Uber for $5, or take the bus five minutes back to hotel for $2.50. Don't pay ridiculous Waikiki parking fees! We didn't. We used TripAdvisor and knew where to go before we arrived!Uber from the airport at rush hour was $24. Taxi was $50-60Courtyard locations seems to very. Some are great. Some are so-so.

Considering we paid lots of money for our reservation we did not get that level of service. Our room was 1106. I have many issues with my stay that included the following: horribly uncomfortable bed, very low shower heads, Wi-Fi speed at snail speed, along with when asking front desk employees is there any city events happening they didn’t know anything, and almost slipping in the elevator. I will expand more on these topics and why I was frustrated and dissatisfied. Before I begin talking about the details of each of these problems, I did talk to front desk and did not have my room changed. Let’s start with the bed, I have not ever had such an uncomfortable sleep in my life, my back was hurting a lot. It felt that I was sinking into the bed while having springs poke me. To me having a good night sleep is very important. Second the shower in our room was so low I had to lean forwards to take a shower, already having back pain from bed this made me even more uncomfortable. With the shower being horribly designed these was a lack of shelf space in washroom and only got 2 towels per day. With the Wi-Fi being so slow, front desk connected me to the internet company. As the guest of the hotel I should not be the one contacting the internet service to resolve the problem while on a vacation. Even though I talked to the internet provider my problem did not get solved. Only place where we got internet was by the door of the bathroom or the front door of the room. We spoke to couple employees at front desk and asked about any local events, they seemed clueless. We missed out on an amazing firework show, and luckily saw a parade for police games. When staying at a hotel one would expect hotel crew to have knowledge of the area. The wet elevator floors were a hazard. If I go on a vacation I want to spend time enjoying myself and not getting injured because the hotel staff cannot keep the premises clean. The hotel does have a pool so that could be why the elevator floors were wet but that is not an excuse to forgo safety. The one thing I was happy about was the valet service, these men and women were really nice and helpful.",,Markpaul C,12,1.0

I booked a Studio King, and ended up with a Double Deluxe (+80SqFt, but two double beds). I checked the app on multiple occasions, and outside of the first 3 days of my stay, Kings, Suites, and further upgrades were available. I don't expect a suite upgrade, however, for a 7-Night stay, it would be nice to have a slightly better upgrade. For reference, I did ask twice during my stay (both in the first 2 days) if any upgrades were available during my time there, and they stated no.Showers = Poor (Cramped, poor water pressure, water temperature only was lukewarm throughout the stay and took 10 minutes to heat up to lukewarm)Pool = Average (Small, but fine. Smaller than average hot tub as well.

Noise is a huge issue. Earplugs on the nightstand were a warning sign about what was to happen. Extremely loud street noise that was distracting. If you spend time in your room to sleep, this may not be the best choice. Go to the full service Marriott property a few blocks away and it's money well-spent. If you're Gold or higher, there is a spectacular breakfast buffet. This will help to offset the cost differential. Parking is a tad high at $42/night. I had a one bedroom suite which was a platinum upgrade - thank you. However, it was still a tad cramped and the air conditioners failed to alleviate the dampness in the room. I was provided a 4pm late checkout which was much appreciated, but the Marriott gave me 10pm on a previous trip.

Given the false ballistic missile alarm, this hotel had no practiced emergency plan in place. Staff, including the GM, security, front desk staff did not know what to tell the guests as far as preparation. The GM was telling some visitors they could head for Diamond Head which, in itself, was inappropriate due to the distance. NO ALOHA5.

Given the hotel has my name, address, phone number, and email, it seems obvious I could have been easily contacted by housekeeping. Yes, yes, I realize the fine print reads that commercial establishments like hotels aren't liable for basically anything BUT wouldn't it be great if someone had the integrity to go the extra mile?

I paid for the rooms...Second disappointment was that even on the 14th floor (actually the 13th), there was a LOT of traffic noise. And while there were two of us occupying the room, they left ONE set of earplugs on the nightstand.Third disappointment was the quality of/stinginess of the towels. They were thin and housekeeping had only left two bath towels in the bathroom. And the bathroom had a TINY counter around the sink...with two of us, it was crowded. I can only imagine how bad this was for the chorus members who were four to a room!Fourth disappointment was the daily breakfast buffet, which was included in our tour price...every morning it was potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausages. No fresh fruit, no yogurt, no Hawaiian specialties. To be clear, this property does not have the typical Courtyard restaurant; this was a non-Marriott restaurant that shared space. On the plus side, this is a convenient location for walking to the Waikiki shopping district and beaches. The bartenders, restaurant staff, and front-desk staff were all welcoming and friendly. They let us use one of the Penthouse suites for chorus rehearsal on two of the nights of our stay. I discovered after checking out that I had left some items in the nightstand. I called the day of check-out and housekeeping found my items and had them ready when I returned a few days later.As at most all Waikiki hotels, parking is expensive, so I recommended walking, using Lyft or pubic transportation while staying here. There is an Enterprise office about three blocks away, so we walked there to pick up a car on the day we checked out.

The confusion was over what exactly was covered by the coupon, and what items were charged for. We were not the only guests that were surprised by this. My advice, avoid the whole issue. If the room comes with breakfast don't charge for juice if you've already ordered coffee.

If the business gives me excellent service...then it goes up to 5-star...if not..it goes the other way. I'm REALLY disappointed at this Courtyard Marriott and the experience I've had during my stay in late Nov/early Dec. It's definitely my worst Marriott experience and I've stayed in many Marriotts all over the world. I'm not against the US$39 per day valet parking charge because I do realize that it's downtown Waikiki. 1st strike against this hotel is the fact that they took our luggage when we arrived, and promised to bring it up to our room. An hour later, we had to go retrieve our own luggage downstairs. The entire luggage cart was still at the Valet Counter!!! On top of that, the valet didn't even provide our claim ticket at that point and made it that much more awkward to retrieve the car when we needed it. (eventually we did get the claim ticket). 2nd strike is when we'd asked for additional pillow and sheets for the pull out sofa right before bedtime. (A 5-star experience would've been that the pillows and sheets already in the room because they knew we had 3 people in the room and my kid would be sleeping out the sofa). So we'd called downstairs to have pillow and sheets delivered. Again, this took an hour and we had to call twice! I'm not asking for a 2 minute turnaround time like a Disney Resort. But my kid needed to go to bed and an hour + additional phone call to remind them is unacceptable! 3rd strike (and this is a first world problem). Internet connection in the room was broken! Fine...Front Desk had asked us to go back to our room and to call them so that they could patch us through to tech support. I did just that and Front Desk didn't even answer my phone calls when I went back upstairs to call right away! It took 20 mins before someone answered my call and patched us through to tech support. Just for kicks and because it was late night, I had time to spend and took a good 45 mins call with Tech Support. (Typical painful tech support call) They had ""reset"" the router finally and the internet worked for about an hour and cut out again after we'd hung up. So we went back to Front Desk the next day to complain. For all our troubles...all they offered was a ""free breakfast"". First off...my issue is with the internet...so they could've offered the ""free upgrade"" to the high speed internet to see if it makes a difference rather than a breakfast! (Pssst...$5 high speed upgrade instead of a $15 breakfast Marriott...it costs you less!!!!) So needless to say...it was very annoying that we couldn't connect and had to go to either the hotel lobby or the McDonald's across the street! (BTW, the McDonald's connection was even faster) I'm not expecting much for a basic internet connection, but a broken connection and a connection that can't even do basic text message = NO connection at all! So obviously with these 3 strikes, this is a 1-star experience. STAY AWAY from this Courtyard! It's poorly ran operationally and while the rooms are clean, they are a bit small compare to other Marriotts. (But I supposed somewhat expected for a downtown Waikiki location)",,Chico L,4,1.0

We arrived at 8 a.m. on a Monday morning. We didn't expect to be allocated a room so early but we were offered a room we could get into straight away. I was asked if I was noise sensitive and I said that I was sure we could cope. We were very pleased to be able to have a refreshing shower after our overnight flight from Sydney, Australia. We did note that the room was a bit noisy but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy place. It wasn't until we got back to our room after dinner that we realised just how noisy the room was. My husband contacted reception and they said they would be able to move us the next day. We were due to go on an excursion around 9 a.m. but decided to check just in case there was a room already available. There was and we were able to move our things immediately. We were assigned a room on the 16th Floor which was the Elite Member Floor. I must say both rooms were quite small but very nicely furnished and the colourings gave a peaceful and calm feeling. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of nooks and crannies to put our items. Even though we are not swimmers, we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing by the pool chatting and enjoying the peaceful surrounds . The bar was well located and we enjoyed many drinks at happy hour. Unfortunately breakfast was not that great and the staff seemed to be in disarray. We watched one couple walk out after telling the server they had waited one hour for their food. They were not happy. All in all I would certainly return and we thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay.","Sydney, Australia","cheeky34</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",82,5.0

I booked a triple corner mini suite that advertised floor to ceiling windows. In the pictures it was absolutely beautiful but just alright in person. The furniture was up-to-date and comfortable along with all the typical courtyard amenities along with a small kitchen sink. The staff were super friendly and helpful, especially the valet crew. Upon arrival, my father asked if we could have a luggage cart to take our luggage to the room. They told us to put our luggage on the cart and it would be brought to the room. We unpacked a bit and I decided to head to the store for some water only to find our luggage still sitting in the parking lot on the cart. I took it to the room myself. The location was great, only two blocks to the beach and tons of shopping, food, and local transportation. I usually have no problem sleeping with windows open in the heart of major cities around the world, but between police sirens and garbage trucks from only the fourth floor, I had to sleep with my headphones in even with the windows closed.There was also a consistent congregation of local 'riffraff', as my father called them, hanging out on the small patch of grass between the main hotel and the tower we were staying in. They looked like just enough trouble that we steered clear of them each time we walked down the sidewalk to go shopping. Overall the room was fine, it could have used a little TLC here and there from a shower upgrade to some patchwork in the bathroom. The safe is in the most inconvenient location ever. It's inside the closet inside the bathroom, forcing you to pretty much kneel and put your elbows on the toilet to access the safe. The pools were nice and relaxing. There is a self-serve laundry room with three washers and three dryers, but the place is consistently busy. It took me three hours of waiting amongst all the other guests to get done two small loads of laundry. I did use the gym which I found all the equipment fully functional unlike many other hotel gyms and there were fresh apples and water along with clean towels provided. Overall the price was a bargain, but I think I would spend just a bit more to stay at the other Marriott on the beach. If you're on a strict budget, this is still overall a great place for the value to your money since it is much cheaper and still a great location.

The location is great- 10 minute walk to the beach, plenty of quirky local shops nearby, and you're just over the road from the TFS duty free store if you're looking for some bargains. There's plenty of food places nearby, and the restaurant in the hotel is also great- offering good breakfast, great early bird deals, and outdoor seating. We had a deluxe room with two double beds, and the room was very reasonably sized with a large balcony. There is a kitchenette in the room including sink, microwave, coffee machine and fridge. There is a mini market in the hotel for buying quick breakfasts, ice creams and even microwave dinners! The coffee shop in the hotel is also great value for a good coffee with very friendly staff. All the staff are so friendly- never walk past without saying aloha! Even when reception is busy the receptionists still find time for a smile across the lobby. Always loads of staff available at the valet as well, we didn't have a car but it looked like there was never a long wait for your car. (On a side note I would definitely hire a car if I went back to Oahu) The maid was lovely, and very knowledgeable, always told us which bus to get on when she asked where we were headed for the day. The pool area was also very relaxed- in the sun in the morning so very quiet, then in the afternoon it was all in the shade so great for families with young kids to keep them out of the sun for a while. They even had two movie nights a week down by the pool!The bar in the hotel was again reasonably priced for the area (Hawaii is SO expensive for food and drink!) and the barmen were lovely- such comfortable seats outside too for all times of the day.

I do highly recommend the Marriott Beach Resort or the Courtyard North Shore if your looking for the resort experience, they are truly the ones that will give you the best Hawaiian atmosphere. But again, if your just on a budget this is a good hotel. Here are a couple of need to knows. 1. Get a high room!

There are many places to get breakfast including IHOP, McDonald's, and Starbucks Reserve nearby. The restaurant downstairs has a restaurant where we had a good breakfast sandwich. To get to our room we went through an indoor corridor and through an exit door that led to an outdoor walkway where our room was located off. I was a little surprised the entrance to the room was from the outside. We had to tie our do not disturb sign to the door because it kept blowing off in the wind. I would suggest the hotel come up with a solution for this as I saw other's do this too. The lobby is extremely fragrant with a Hawaiian floral scent and too overpowering so I think they can tone it down so it doesn't bother people who are sensitive to strong perfume. The bathroom was tiny and shower was dark. We are not big people and it was just big enough for one of us. The sink and shower are both compact sizes so that could be an issue for some.

After looking at all the cords, it was due to the plug being loose. We both had stuffy and runny noses while we were in the room and thought maybe needs a new air filter. When we set the air at night it seems like it doesn't remain at the temperature we set it because it would get stuffy in the middle of the night and the air felt damp. On a good note, the staff was friendly and when we called for more towels, the employee came promptly. We also had an issue with our door not opening. After getting a new key card and that not working, a worker came to fix the door. He came within 5 minutes.

The rooms are small but functional and the hotel amenities are what you would expect from a 3 star hotel in Waikiki. Be aware though, if you are on the Kuhio St side it is very noisy at night and the free wifi is very slow. My issues then, lie with the incidentals and credit card holding charges expected of the guests. We had booked two rooms with bookings.com for 10 nights. Both rooms were under the same booking but two different surnames. When checking in I supplied the booking conformation and was informed our rooms were on different levels because unless they are under the same name they are not treated as a group booking... go figure. We were then told that they would hold the entire room amount plus $200 USD for room incidentals. As we were paying with cash (5 different people paying) this did not suit us at all. I offered to pay the entire amount upfront and have the $200 incidentals charged to our CC. Louise informed us that that was not policy and the only way to pay for the full amount in cash was after the 7th day (?) and the holdings would then be released back to my CC taking 5-7 days. With her poor attitude I accepted defeat and agreed. She continued to tell us rudely that our rooms weren't ready and to come back at 3. They did call us at 2.40pm to say one room was now ready so we headed back to the hotel. I had had time to think about our CC situation and decided that it wasn't good enough. I spoke to the person behind the reception, now the manager named Jodie who agreed to release our money and accept full cash payment (how easy was that) She informed us that the payment would be returned within 5-7 days (it was held for no more then an hour). Jodie confirmed that both card amounts were released and I was satisfied. On the seventh day one card amount had been released but not the second. I left it a few more days incase it was due to being an Australian bank and on the night before check out spoke with Ana (who was very helpful and friendly during the visit) confirm the release and she said it had NOT been released. I would like to mention that this was not a few hundred dollars it was over $6000 AUD. According to all three people this was the policy however this is not made clear on booking.com which states '100% of the first night may be charged after booking' only. Overall a very very disappointing stay which dampened our holiday and we will certainly not make the same mistake twice. ",,Lauren O,2,1.0

It's a standard Courtyard. The hotel was appealing from the outside with nice landscaping and a small pool. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I was in and out of the lobby frequently and also only heard pleasant interactions with the staff and other guests. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby for a light breakfast. There is also a market with a microwave in the lobby. There is a small bar that always seemed to have a steady business. The pool is small and only gets sun for a short amount of time but it was pretty. In the section that I was in there were ice machines only on two floors. My room had a refrigerator was was good. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The room was small but clean and sufficient for one person. My big negative for this hotel is the noise. I was on the 5th floor on the Kuhio St. side of the building. I was shocked at how much noise came in. Kuhil St was very busy. There was a bus stop 1/2 block away and around the corner was a tour bus pick-up for Japanese tourists. There was a constant stream of buses. Two nights the bar across the street was extremely noisy! There were the frequent emergency vehicles going by. The other side of the hotel was probably quieter. If I had not had ear plugs I would not have been able to sleep. There is an Italian Restaurant connected to the hotel that also is open for breakfast. It's about a 10 minute walk to the beach. There are two ABCs stores within the block. Plenty of places to eat within a 15 minute walk both higher end and budget friendly.

It appears that most complaints about this hotel is that they are not as good as other Marriotts.

And the placing the wardrobe inside the very small bathroom is a very bad idea.3. The breakfast was the worst of all and totally disappointing. Very poor for a 3 star hotel. Never expected such a bad breakfast from a Marriott hotel. Very limited choices and too small portion sizes. Even the banana was not provided in full. Never seen any hotel providing half banana for breakfast. And the size reduced to a quarter by the end of the stay.4. Rooms not sound proof. Only table lamps. Poor lighting in the room.5. The deluxe large (king or queen) guest room is poor, but expensive than the deluxe double room.","Singapore, Singapore","Suresh Anand S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",3,3.0

Not a property we would likely select for vacation. We found the observations of other travelers to be on the mark. Summarizing key points:Pro's: - Quieter than the heart of Waikiki (Kaulakua Ave).  - Clean. - Surprisingly competitive happy hour prices in the lobby bar! - No resort fees.Con's: -The Royal Hawaiian Tower has a single, small elevator with no access control. The valet stand sort of oversees the building entrance, On the whole, would recommend single women travelers not use this tower. (It could be easily resolved with key card control of the elevator). The main tower is fine; it has interior corridors. - Very tight control of parking by the valets. No quick in an outs. Even a couple minutes will incur a fee of about $3 for the first 30 minutes.Neither, just for transparency: - About a 4 block walk to Waikiki Beach. - Like much of Waikiki, an older property. Clearly wasn't built as a Courtyard, yet meets the standard. - Not much green space. This is common in Waikiki. At least they didn't fill every inch with a souvenir stand or bar. If one cares about décor and was looking for something Hawaiian, it might not measure up.So, Courtyard represents itself appropriately. Its not a resort, yet is clean and comfortable. Service is decent, and everything in Waikiki is within walking distance. There's a value play for those who simply need a place to sleep. We have business on Oahu about once a year, and would consider staying here again.","Yorktown, Virginia","FJVLS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorktown, Virginia</strong>",148,3.0

If you came to Hawaii to explore our beautiful islands or a local needing a much-needed staycation this is a great hotel to try. It is reasonably priced and has several amenities that bigger hotels offer. The Guest Room and Guest Suites are newly renovated. My husband and I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. It was furnished with a microwave, pull-out couch, and mini-refrigerator. It had 2 flat screen tv's and several outlets in the room. The mattresses were comfortable and the pillows were soft. Our room was on the 7th floor. The city noise did not bother us at all. I loved the decor of the room and the soft relaxing color scheme. What is Awesome about this hotel:1. LocationFOR TOURISTS: It's int he heart of lWaikiki, within walking distance to Waikiki Beach, Shopping, signature Restaurants and entertainment. LOCALS: It's near many popular hotels where you will attend business meetings, graduations, weddings, etc. 2. Amenities*On site restaurant and coffee shop.*Fitness center.*2 outdoor pools (One is FRESH water and the other is SALT WATER both heated).*Jacuzzi*FREE WIFI*SPA Facility*Snack Bar *Free business office WITH PRINTERThere are more amenities that they offer. 3. Great staff that exemplify the Aloha spiritFrom the valet to the front desk, room help and every staff in the hotel we were greeted with smiling faces. 4. No resort Fee! For your Information: 1. ParkingAs every hotel in Waikiki you have to pay for parking. Courtyard Waikiki Beach only offers Valet. It cost $39 PER DAY! 2. Spada (on site restaurant) This restaurant offers Italian food. Use your registered credit card on Yelp to get 3% back on your total bill. When my husband and I came for lunch there was only 1 server for the whole restaurant. 3.

This is a very old and run down hotel. I stayed in the tower. The elevator is available to anyone off the street, no key card required. Then the entrance to the room is outside, motel style. If I had been staying alone I would have been uneasy as there were a lot of sketchy people hanging outside near the vacant lot directly across from the tower. The entrance door doesn't fit the frame so bugs, light, humidity can all easily come in. Many marks on the walls that could have easily been fixed and painted over. Beds uncomfortable and small lengthwise. My fuse blew in the bathroom and maintenance took about an hour finding the problem, somewhere outside of my room. All the while I was trying to get ready for dinner in the dark. Hairdryer was cracked, still worked but I wasn't sure if I may get shocked. A/C unit cranked as low as it would go but still was warm at night. Walking distance to beach but the view was that sketchy lot. Parked my car for about 2 min in a space that was for valet so I could run in and get my luggage. With all the one ways and tight entrance area to valet it was more convenient for me. When I came back down with my bag the valet was moving cars to box my rental in so they could tow it. He also scolded me for parking there. There were about 5 open valet spaces so I don't know what his problem was but not nice to scold your guest. I would never stay here again. Only did this time because the price my company would pay but for $196/night it was way overpriced. It's on the level of a cheap motel, not a Marriott.

This hotel honestly tells you the cost per night without the subterfuge of a tacked on fee to pay for the pool--which in the case of the hotels above are small. I do have one negative comment. I have previously stayed in the main part of the hotel. I stayed this time in the tower across the way. It is much noisier than the main building and my view is of parking garages, so the balcony is useless. I am also not crazy about the room which is handicapped accessible which means there is a roll-in shower. Obviously, if I needed this, it would be great. The room is bigger and might be perfect (Pullout sofa I don't need) for a family with children. But I preferred my previous room which was much smaller but I could see the water from the bed.

We had a reservation here and hoped to check in early. The reception desk gave us a room when we arrived. It was in the back tower. (I have to assume that the back tower was a different from the front tower as a used Yugo is from a Mercedes.) The walk outside our room was littered with trash. The bathtub in the room was the worst I'd ever seen, outside of a dump. It was supposed to be a junior suite. Outside of being a large room, there was nothing suite-like about the room. I won't go into all the things wrong with the room, but as we were leaving, there was some type of package taped above the door. I didn't check it out for fear that it was drug paraphernalia left by the last guest. My wife fell asleep due to exhaustion. When I complained to the manager on duty, he did offered to move us to a different room, presumably in the front tower, which looked good. I wish I had taken him up on his offer. In the alternative, he did offer to credit us back some Marriott Rewards points which we used for our stay. It was of little consolation. The staff was friendly, but the fact that such a room existed in the Marriott chain, much less was billed as a ""junior suite"", is appalling. And we are platinum elite Marriott Rewards members. If that is the kind of room one gets there as a platinum elite member, I shudder to think what kind of room that someone not a Marriott Rewards member would receive.

That said, I think it is important for would be visitors to have the proper expectations when visiting.My Visit. It was a short stay with a late arrival made later by a delayed flight. In the end I arrived at the hotel around 1:30 a.m. I called prior to arriving because Waze directed me to Kuhio Street without positioning me at the hotels entrance on Royal Hawaiin Ave. The front desk person who answered the call was helpful in providing from detailed directions. Just be advised that Honolulu has a lot of one way streets so if you are coming from the airport, you may get similar directions, so you will want to turn onto Lewers St, then right on Manukai St then Right onto Royal Hawaiian and look for the Entrance on the right. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a very welcoming and friendly front desk attendant (Jason) who quickly checked me in, acknowledged my Platinum status and provided my welcome amenities and granted me my late check out request. Since it was a short visit, he gave me an abbreviated overview of the hotel and food options but wisely realized I was tired and only hit the major points.Going up to my room, my initial reaction was similar to others, the overall vibe is tired and a throwback to yesteryear. While renovations were recently completely, a major overhaul is still needed! For example, the door to the room seemed to be similar to one found on an exterior facing room but didn't quite close properly, the sliding glass door & windows didn't adequately block street noise (mind you I was on the 17th floor) and the shower head directed the water flow at an angle so that it only hit me from the shoulder and up (and water flow below my shoulder were run off from my body and the shower head couldn't be moved).So despite these issues, I did find the room to be clean and the bed was moderately comfortable. Additionally, what the hotel lacks in its building and rooms, it more than makes up for it with the attitude of its staff. Everyone one of the employees I interacted with were extremely friendly and customer focused. While not directly on the beach, the hotel is located in near a lot of restaurants and shops.So overall, the hotel is tired and dated but clean, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.

This hotel appears to be a rehab of something else. However, the workmanship is mediocre. The lobby bartenders are extremely accommodating. I ate there two nights (food served by the restaurant) and it was good. The lobby is open air and pleasant. Be aware the hotel is not close to the beach.There is a shortage of parking. So valet parking is required. My primary problem is with the rooms. My room was very small and the bathroom was extremely small. I checked the floor map in the room and it appeared that all rooms on my floor were the same size. I requested a king size bed and was given a queen size. The room was not large enough to hold a king size. Even two people who know each other intimately would find this room too small. The room smelled and the air conditioner could not control the humidity. There was mold in the bathroom shower. On two of the three days I was there I had to ask that my room be cleaned when it had not been done by 5 p.m.The above situation is definitely not consistent with Marriott Courtyard quality that I usually experience.","Sedona, Arizona","Ron G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sedona, Arizona</strong>",12,2.0

There is no real place to put your luggage away and two people can't really be in the bathroom at the same time.If you are sensitive to sound at all I would not recommend this hotel. Other reviews have said the walls are thin and that proved to be true for us as well. The man next door was a loud talker (not shouting but every word could be heard) as well as any drawer opening, etc. There was a wind storm one night that howled around us so that it felt like we might end up in Oz any time.Housekeeping was careless. They forgot to replenish coffee, they left cleaning supplies in the room. They poured leftover coffee in the toilet and spilled coffee on the toilet seat and didn't clean it up. It also looked like they had used our washcloth to wipe up coffee and then hung the coffee stained washcloth with the other towel. Not very impressive. That said, if you just want a place to put your stuff while you go to the beach, It is about a 1/2 mile walk to the beach and the bar has a pretty busy happy hour.

We stayed for one night since the cost was a bit lower than the larger Marriott on the beach. However our flight was canceled and the airline put us up at the larger Marriott the following night so I have the opportunity to compare. Even before staying at the larger facility I noticed off the bat these rooms are teeeny tiny. Understand it's a city hotel but never have I stayed in that small of a room. In addition walks are paper thin and could hear word for word for neighbors conversations which didn't add up to a good nights sleep. I'd also note getting to the entrance is a pain both Google and wake kept taking us to the front door which not where you enter, we drove around in circles a few times. I will say it was very clean, in walking distance to everything and staff was friendly. However for a few bucks more go to the larger Marriott.

That night the air conditioner didn't work too well and my room was pretty muggy. Luckily the following day I got an real upgrade to a one bedroom suite. Enough about the rooms and let tell you more about the hotel... The bar is pretty small but appealing and the drink prices are resonable especially during happy hour. Don't expect much from the pool. Didn't seem like it got much sun because it's covered by hotel shadows from each tower and very old in appearance. As far as restaurants, there is a coffe bean and an Italian place. I had lunch at the Italian place and don't expect much 1-10 I give it a 7 based on my experience. I recommend the Siam palace (Thai restaurant) across st.

With our one day/night package, we chose to stay at the Courtyard Waikiki Beach. The property's pictures looked nice, the accessibility to Waikiki's amenities was great, and the price per night seemed reasonable......until it came to us actually checking in.Before we get into some of the areas that weren't all that spectacular about this property, I'd like to begin with the positives. First and foremost, you're on vacation in Hawaii! Life is pretty darn good if these words are coming out of your mouth! Anyway, you'll love the location of this hotel! It's within walking distance of everything Waikiki has to offer.The staff was very friendly and the lobby had a clean and updated look to it! And while we didn't use it, there is a small heated salt water pool (which I thought was very unique).Now, for the more challenging aspects of the property...... while the actual hotel itself is easy to locate, the accessibility to get your car parked to check in is not practical at all. In fact, if you're driving your own car, prepare to take a unique route just to get down the one way street that leads up to the parking area itself. In addition, please note that when you check in, you must leave your car parked in the designated area near valet until you've completed the entire check in process. Once you've received your room key, you will then meet up with the valet staff who will park your vehicle for you. It is important to note that there is no self parking and you must pay the $40 a day to have valet park your vehicle. While we completely understand that space is a premium in Hawaii, we literally had to have our jaws picked up off the floor when they told us what the daily valet fee was. The final fee that we nearly incurred was the Early Check In Fee. Should you wish to check in before 3:00 p.m., they will charge you $25.00.The room itself was fine. It's not really worth a complaint or a praise. However, you should know it gets very ""lively"" and loud at night in the Waikiki area. Neither my husband or I slept that well due to the sirens, car alarms, slamming doors, and screaming people that seemed to stay active throughout the night. Of course this isn't the actual property's fault, but if you're looking for a quiet getaway to Hawaii, Waikiki is probably not the best choice (as this goes for any hotel in the area).All in all, we love Oahu and the Waikiki experience!

We arrived around 11am and was offered a ""Loft room"" in one of their adjacent buildings as it was the only one available at the time. The front desk clerk did mention that there were stairs but that the room would be slightly larger than the equivalent rooms in their main tower. What we didn't realise is that there would be 3 flights of stairs! The loft rooms themselves are adequate but very dark during the day and noisy most nights as there was a bar close by on the adjacent street. Given that we intended to spend most of our time outside of the hotel room, we weren't too bothered except for the fact that the hot water took an extremely long time to kick in, making showers frustratingly long or unbearably cold. We didn't want to kick up too much of a fuss initially as we suspected it might be due to over usage, but after 3 nights of very cold showers, we requested a room change. The hotel was apologetic and moved us to a room in the main tower which was much nicer, lighter and with hot water! We found that the concierge was extremely busy and with only one person manning the desk, we spent a lot of time waiting to be served. When we did reach the front of the line however, they provided top notch service. Brent in particular was amazing considering the pressure of a growing line waiting for his services. He very patient, helpful and thorough. Other staff that provided excellent service: Jodi at the front desk who was very accommodating of our room change request, and Kalin at the Valet/Bell Services who was very friendly and helpful too.We would recommend this hotel based on convenience and cost, but would specifically request a room in the main tower on a higher floor facing the pool the next time.

The walls are thin, expect some noise from adjacent rooms and elevators. Rooms seem like they were renovated within the past 5 years. The problem and why I'm scoring so poorly is that the rooms are not secure. A little pressure on the room door handle and it pops right open without the use of a keycard. Anyone from the street can access the elevator and rooms and any level! Two days after this issue (which was corrected by the on-site engineer) the housekeeping service had left my door wedged open during cleaning and never pushed the latch back in.

It's the fourth night of my four-night stay -- a solo trip to see family. It's my second time in Waikiki.Would I stay again? Maybe, if traveling solo and I got a good rate that couldn't be matched by surrounding properties. The room is pretty small, which is fine for a solo traveler. For a couple or a family, it definitely could get crowded. That's factor.I had just a basic room ... and knew that when booking. Still, offering a microwave in addition to the refrigerator would be nice.However, the location is pretty much ideal for the price. No, it's not on the beach, and for the price you're paying you shouldn't expect it to be on the beach. Don't be fooled by the hotel's name. But the beach is plenty close, and the more tranquil Ala Wai, while not a tourist draw, is even closer and is a great spot for runners and walkers.The hotel has been recently updated and it shows. The room was super-clean, the lobby was nicely done, the pool was good, and the fitness area a bit above average for this sort of property. All five stars in that department.The biggest drawback of this property and location is the street noise. Garbage trucks, buses, and emergency vehicles remind you this is a crowded urban space and far from a beachfront paradise. That, and the small room size, are about the only negatives.It's important to keep in mind that Waikiki is a tourist trap teeming with people who are willing to be ensnared by a trap that just happens to be steps from a pretty dang awesome beach.

However, for being in Hawaii, the size is well above average and the noise is quieter than what I would have expected staying in downtown Waikiki.

The hotel essentially is a renovation of an older building that was just completed in 2016. So The insides are brand-new, but the outsides are the same. So the hotel itself is a little strange as the older outside and the new inside Clash a little.

And our first room did have a musty smell and we ended up switching rooms -- which was fine.But if you don't care about the disconnect between the outside look and inside look, this hotel is a good option, though i still prefer the Hyatt place down the street.Though the hotel is right on Kuhio Street, those doors have been closed and you enter via the side Royal Hawaiian Avenue.

Room size is far smaller than Courtyard standard, and bathrooms are laughably small, with shower heads at about 5 feet, 10 inches off the minuscule shower pan.Check-in is generally good, but beware the staff and their ""we're upgrading you!"" spiel. In this building, ""upgrades"" can often get you a SMALLER room, such as the xx19 rooms. These rooms, while at the end of the building, have even more reduced square footage because a service elevator cuts into a corner. I would be surprised if xx19 rooms are any larger than 140 square feet total.Decor has been refreshed and the rooms are generally clean - and why not, it can't possibly take more than 10 minutes to clean them! - with reasonably large TVs and channel selection. But the sliding doors to the balconies remain single pane, meaning traffic noise, and there is no such thing as an ""ocean view"" at this property - you're either looking at the canal (even numbered rooms) or at Kuhio Avenue and the Ohana hotel directly across the street (odd numbered rooms).Consider this if you're a single traveler, less than 6 feet tall, and if the hotel is below $200 when the other options are significantly above $200.

It was nice in the 30ies, 40ies, 50ies, now it lives from its reputation from older times. So does this Hotel, amongst others I´ve been to in Waikiki! When I checked in, rooms were not available in the main building, where reception and elevators right behind it are. The building across the parking lot is not far to walk, but old, run-down and 8 stories high. Its windows are aluminum, and have not seen rubber insulation in centuries, if any at all. The noise in a room on second floor was just awful, very loud and nasty. So it would have been on 8th floor too, a lady told me who was in one of them. After a day I had to move to the main building! Which was organized by reception, after they finally noticed and acknowledged my complaint! Room on 17th floor #1710 actually, a bit smaller than my first room, but nicer, cleaner, better, higher, not so noisy, even though here too, no rubber insulation on windows. In fact, they must have been put in in the 1950ies, and never been changed. So if you expect a noise reduction room, don´t! Once you opened that window, it seems as whole Waikiki population has gotten into your room to party! All in all my stay was okay at Courtyard Marriott. One day a school group arrived and all members were seating on each square foot of the reception hall, amongst their luggage etc. It was loud, noisy, nasty, and the weather outside was rainy. So my mood writing this might have been affected by the bad weather too, but take that away, there is still some points valid in this review. Don´t choose a room in the side building, its rooms are bigger, louder, not so comfy. Also the pool provided in that building is a pool with four concrete walls around it, so if you want to commit suicide while on vacation, this would be the perfect place to do it! Better go to the beach and do it there! Lots of of nicer possibilities to exit this planet! Check in at 3 pm is kind of VERY late. Check out at 12 is hence too early, given the amount of rooms they have. I guess its profit that drives the rules in this place.

Weird combination!I called the front desk for a courtesy toiletry kit. They said, ""We stopped offering those"". What? Who does that!?My girlfriend and I sat at the pool one morning early and we were ""whooshed"" away by a cranky old groundskeeper that told us we could not sit on the chairs...you know...the ones used for sitting?

I booked 2 nights for 4 people. Two nights is a part of my 9 nights trip on Hawaii islands. I have stayed 2 nights on Courtyard on the other 2 islands resectively and was satisfied. So naturally I expected a good and same quality stay. 1. Bed: I wonder how a sofa bed is qualified as a bed. Its main usage should be a sofa, not a bed. Well I realize that I did not fully understand the description for the room a queen and a sofa bed because I perceived a sofa bed was not a bed. A sofa bed doesn't have the same quality as a regular bed. 2. NOISY: The room is ""noise through"". All the noises come through the windows on the balcony. The windows is supposed to filter the noise. I couldn't sleep and woke up at 3pm. A passing truck or suv on the street is a concrete example. So n-o-i-s-y!!! 3. Service people are still friendly.In conclusion I would not recommend my friends to stay on this place. My friends are planning to come to Hawaii because of my experience.

I only stay at Marriotts and I do have a good relationship with chain, but this was a bad experience.Cons:Wifi - Non-existent in the rooms. You will be lucky to load the google page before 9pm, but after 9 expect it not to load at all. The lobby appears to work fine.Door & locks - Every room has issues with the doors. After checking in and dropping off my luggage, I had to use my foot for leverage to close the door. I did have them fix, which they promptly addressed but you still needed to pull to make sure it locked properly.Bathroom - Small in all dimensions. If you are short or overweight, this is not the hotel for you. I barely fit in the shower and I am short, I had to constantly adjust the shower head. One other thing that bothered me but I never had the hotel staff fix was the toilet. It was not fully bolted down so every time you sat down you felt it move a little.Halls - They were sort of cleaning up the place. I noticed a lot of drying fixes. I just wish they had also painted them. Pool - You are in Hawaii, what is the need for a pool? I did walk down there, its a bit dirty and small, not to mention because it is surrounded by buildings, don't expect any tanning to occur here.Pros:Pillows - God I love these pillows. I keep meaning to buy some of them. They are amazing. The beds are ok, but these pillows are just to die for.Lobby - They must have just re-did the place recently because they were doing photo shoots of the bar, guest station, etc.Location - While not right on the beach, you are a very short walk from everything.

However, we came in at midnight and the bed wasn't made, no sheets or anything were in the room and we had to wait for housekeeping. When housekeeping did finally come, they just dropped off linens and left, So much for making up the bed.

No airport shuttle and some of the reception staff came across as inadequately trained and experienced in understanding the nuances of the hospitality and tourist industry. For example, it could be uncomfortable to a guest to be asked to wait on the kerb, with luggage, in anticipation of an airport shuttle (organised at Honolulu airport), when the same facility could be provided by the hotel staff. This is especially when one takes into account Hawaiian weather as frequent passing showers, light to moderate winds and express sunshine as also possible unfavourable traffic conditions. This is also an experience that a Marriott Guest would find as difficult to assimilate.

My room was in the main tower with a king bed (16th floor), but my parents got a room with 2 doubles and got checked in to the darkest, spookiest, dreariest room in a small outer building (reminded me of a Motel 6....do those even still exist). I took one for the team and let them have my partial ocean view with a king, boy did I regret it! The noise ALL night was ridiculous. Between people using the pool until late hours, and people entering and exiting the complex using the stairs and the side ""wrought iron"" gate that slams shut every time someone uses it, I got NO sleep! If you get assigned a room out there, do yourself a favor and request a room change. The room was very dark and depressing. Insufficient lighting throughout. I asked to room change the next day, and the Front Desk staff accommodated with no issues. The next room (night 2) was ok. In the main tower, but on the 3rd floor. The street noise (traffic) is prevalent all night, but at least I didnt have to deal with the wrought iron gate slamming shut all night. My parents left on day 3, so I got the room I was originally supposed to stay in for, the next two nights. 16th floor partial ocean view. Minimal traffic noise up here. Bright and cheerful room. Need more lighting in the bathroom. In both 1601 and 317, you are practically showering in the dark. There's no light inside the shower, so you are relying on the vanity lighting which is awful. Cleanliness is just average (though the housekeeping staff are super nice, and friendly), dust on the clock/nightstand, crooked lamp shades, my safe broke on day #3 and the engineer came up 3 times with different solutions, but none worked so I did without.

The double room, although very nice and clean with a very comfy bed was tiny, with a tiny bathroom, and not sound proof at all. So we asked if we could upgrade. They upgraded us for free as it was our honeymoon but claimed they did not know it was our honeymoon until we told them even though the travel agent put it on the booking and the previous hotel on our trip knew. Unfortunately there were no suites available that day so we had to wait until out third night of four to upgrade.The corner suite was very nice, sound was not a problem due to the layout of the suite and the bed was again very comfy. The bathroom was slightly bigger than the last but still tiny. Only a shower no bath.There is a pool and a jaccuzi which were nice, we spent a few hours sunbathing with cocktails. Another thing to note is that it is illegal to drink alcohol on the beach in Hawaii so if you're picturing yourself sipping a cocktail on a sunlounger on the seafront, stop in a hotel on the seafront as there's no beach bars etc. ","Whitestake, United Kingdom","Lauz5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitestake, United Kingdom</strong>",8,4.0

We didn't like the coffee, had brought our own shampoo, used scraps of paper to write on.

I have found that some hotels in waikiki don't have good air conditioners. The wifi is free, but I chose to upgrade so I don't know how good the free wifi is. I also like the fact that the business center computers and printer downstairs are free to use. They have a restaurant, coffee shop and spa on the lobby level.

The room really did look quite nice.

Other than this I would say the staff is very courteous and professional including the valet parkers and I would recommend the hotel as it is located nicely for walking around Waikiki.","Chesapeake, Virginia","jackrF7576KZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chesapeake, Virginia</strong>",1,3.0

It's centrally located in Waikiki, walking distance to the beach, and right outside the bus stop.I saved a ton of money on cab fare, using the bus in combination with google maps public transportation feature. I ended up getting a newly remodeled suite that had its own living room. The upgrade was great, new furniture and great decor. I also had a open concept shower for the handicapped. So I didn't experience the smaller showers people keep mentioning on this site.Staff was super friendly and helped me with recommendations.My only knock on this property was during the day, construction was LOUD.

Why do I keep staying here? Because I'm a business traveler and have to stay on budget. Oahu sadly lacks any business class hotels. Plus, I like the points.However, if I were on vacation or even using Marriott rewards to stay here, I wouldn't recomend it. Its an old hotel that was marginally updated and rebranded a Courtyard. The standard rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are even smaller. If you are a larger person, you may not even fit it the shower stall. Seriously.The rooms that over look Kuhio are very noisy.Do you like icy drinks? Well, get ready for a walk because the only ice machine is on the 2nd floor, out an exit door onto an unused, decrepit lanai. Oh, don't forget your room card, because without it, NO ICE FOR YOU!The staff is friendly enough, but one of the FD people kept refering to Bali. Go to Bali. Take a right past the bar at Bali. Hmmmm, could you mean VALET?And be aware that there is NO street parking available in Waikiki. The Courtyard charges $37 per night parking. So, my friend, think you scored a deal of the room price? Think again.I know that they offered free wifi, but not sure if its because of being a Gold member or not.On the positive side, its a quick walk to Waikiki beach and shopping area.

We tried to call reception and the concierge a few times but there was no answer. That morning, when we mentioned our concerns to the front desk, they immediately offered a breakfast voucher. We decided to upgrade to a bigger room with 2 double beds, microwave, sink and a safe for an extra US$25 per night. It was worth every cent, as we got the 17th floor, quieter and roomier.
