From the moment of enquiring to checking in the staff and David the manager in particular was super helpful and welcoming. We arrived early in the morning and were able to check in straight away for a small early check in fee which was much appreciated and reasonable since we basically had the whole day ahead of us and it was good to settle in and shower before heading to the beach. The rooms are recently refurbished and kinda kitsch which we loved. Really keen and fresh with an old fashioned island vibe. Location was great 2 blocks back from the beach and with Dukes Lane 50 metres way we had a direct line to the beach.The pool area is small and all that you need with the BEST sun loungers I think I've ever experienced. Wide and soft and plenty of sun or shade. Free coffee and ice all day long, free newspaper, there's a bar being built but no kitchen or café not that you need it. In the room there's no tea or coffee making facilityor utensils or plates etc, but there is a fridge for your drinks.

I spent 3 nights here the weekend before the Coronavirus lockdown began and was given a spacious room facing Nohonani St. on the 2nd floor. I arrived early at 11am and tried doing early check-in but the front desk was demanding $50 so I opted for free luggage storage instead and returned in the evening after doing some sight-seeing. The king bed was very comfortable, the free WiFi internet was fast and the bathroom was well stocked with towels and toiletries. There was no bathtub and the shower stall's shower head was positioned really low and couldn't be raised. The TV had plenty of channels, in English as well as foreign languages. Transportation-wise, this hotel is very well connected to most landmarks with a direct bus, such as 19/20 from HNL airport and downtown, 42 to/from Pearl Harbor, 2 to/from Diamond Head, etc. There are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores along nearby Kuhio Ave and aforementioned International Market Place has free Hula performances in the evening in the central foyer.

Unfortunately this year, my sister got rammed into by a newby surfer, and got pretty substantial injury (she will be is fine, she was seen by a doctor there and is also seeing a doc back home!). This left her unable to leave the hotel room for the first few days, unable to eat any solid food, and needing to ice her face. This was our third year doing this so we've stayed in many hotels in/around Waikiki but we could not have asked for a more genuinely caring staff than the ones here, especially David and Christianne at the front desk. David constantly asked if my sister was feeling ok, tended to our needs, made sure all the staff was aware that we needed to use their freezer downstairs (the in-room fridge doesn't have a freezer) to switch out the ice pack every few hours, provided us with a small spoon so she could eat. As for the facility, it really was a hidden gem. We've stayed in up-scale hotels like Surfjack, Sheraton and Alohilani, more comparable places like Shoreline before - but the White Sand's room was surprisingly large. Every room seemed to have been equipped with a large balcony or a porch space (on the 1F), free coffee downstairs, enough storage space, decent sized counter space with a kitchen sink and microwave (which helped with heating up soup once she can manage semi-solids) and even a table to eat on. It's not 'grammable' like Surfjack or Shoreline, nor do they have fancy/cute cafe like Shoreline, but it was everything we needed it to be. Clean, spacious, balcony, and close to everything. The only thing we'd ask as an improvement is perhaps a screen door on the balcony so we can air it out without worrying about the mosquitos, and perhaps water fountain/jug downstairs so that we don't have to keep purchasing plastic water bottles and adding to the plastic waste. But these are all easy fixes; what makes or breaks a stay is kind, dedicated, and caring staff and you won't find one much better than David! Also room tips: Don't stay on 1F if you care about privacy. They don't seem to have an elevator (or were we blind? We couldn't find one) so don't stay up high if you have walking problems. We stayed in 2F and it wasn't a problem at all!","Tokyo, Japan","Kyoko-Angel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",13,5.0

If you recall the open, flowery approach to the front desk, the abundance of greenery, and the warm, aloha spirit-----be prepared for a shock! The current White Sands is very clean, fair prices, comfortable beds, good location, with a polite, uniformed generic staff. The aloha spirit is gone!Our daily living was a challenge. In the remodeling, our once comfortable studio no longer had a kitchen, dishes, cutlery, table, chairs, or reading light. The rather useless tea wagon occupied space next to the small storage unit with three drawers. I gave the space to my partner and lived out of my suitcase. The new shower floor was very slippery with no place to put my soap or wash cloth.Our unit had a microwave and a refrigerator. The block for the local grocery store was demolished, so our choices were the ABC store or constantly eating out. There was regular morning coffee, period. Concrete and bamboo with some surviving greenery here and there surrounded the existing lovely waterfall. Gone were the lush surroundings that attracted the birds and their songs. Each once open lanai was now surrounded by bamboo fencing. It reminded me of Ala Moana Shopping Center, especially at night when bright lights banished the evening darkness and gave daylight all night.After returning yearly since the White Sand reopened, and writing gushing reviews, this is my final review.

It is just amazing what they have done to the rooms: very tasty, comfortable and modern rooms, with a retro feel to it. Above all, the rooms are very quiet, which is unique for such a central location in Honolulu. Everything you need when it comes to shopping, food and the beach is within walking distance. If you want to go to Ala Moana shopping center, you can make use of the complementary shuttle service. The central courtyard/garden/pool adds to a very relaxing atmosphere in the bustling city, and it is nice to sit on your own terrace or balcony. On top of it all, the management, staff and reception is so friendly and helpful! Hard to get better value for money.

Very Good location. No breakfast or restaurant in the hotel. Plenty of small / big eateries, grocery shops, malls & beach very close by. It’s a three storied building surrounded by skyscrapers all around. It has a small swimming pool with trees around. When one sits in the balcony (Our room was facing pool), one has a feeling of being in oasis in a desert.Rooms are slightly on the smaller side. Toiletries generally ok. Micro, cooking range etc available. Cutlery & crockery not of good standard. One day’s rent is deducted on booking as a deposit.Hotel does not have a lift (not given in the website). However, luggage were taken up to our second floor room by the staff. The corridor was stinking. Most of the gadgets in our room were dysfunctional. It took more than 24 hrs for all to come in line. However, I was given a financial compensation for the same (I asked for it). Hotel was planned to go for renovation. But that doesn’t mean that there should be stink or the gadgets would not work.Two of the front desk staff (both male) were impolite & also not helpful. In fact one did not intimate me an important message (about discount) for about 24 hrs. When asked, he started giving lame excuses. Also he totally forgot to intimate the staff that I would pay the bills in cash & not by credit card. This caused a little confusion at check out time, but resolved.The ladies in the front desk were helpful.Being a part of the Aqua group, this hotel had many free / concessions from many shops around. This was not told to guests. They just kept a small notice on the front desk. Accordingly we missed many such facilities. It is in the hotel’s interest & for their publicity that they should intimate the guests.All airport shuttle service providers touch this hotel for pick up & drop. WiFi is just in the lobby & not inside the room.Hotel has a luggage room where they keep luggage.Besides all these problems which I am sure are getting looked into during renovation, we shall stay here if we again visit Honolulu just for two reasons… great location and the joy one gets just being in an oasis amongst the skyscrapers",pune,"cbkrays</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>pune</strong>",11,4.0

Staff all friendly and helpful, both the front desk and housekeeping.  Bedding was good, a bit firm for me personally (sleep # 30). It's basically a U-shape with a courtyard in the middle with a pool, hot tub, koi pond, and beautiful landscaping. Surrounded by a solid wall so the only entry is the walkway by the front desk. 3 floors, no elevator, but multiple times, staff members offered to carry stuff up the stairs for me. Parking on site at standard Waikiki rates. (Spaces, also like many Waikiki places, are tiny!) Room 302 had a lanai looking onto the courtyard - I loved it!. I was even with tops of some trees which provided partial privacy from other lanais. Looking up, I saw high rises partly blocked by higher trees. Rooms on the outside of the U seem to face the privacy wall or, on upper floors, a parking garage. This room had a kitchenette with small fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and electric range. It was basically but decently stocked with dishes, flatware, a good knife, corkscrew, can opener, dish soap and drainer, and a few other basic utensils - everything I needed. I had to move the coffee maker to find a plug (or unplug the microwave) - not a problem for me. Coffee and fixings replenished every day. This room had a connecting door to the next with absolutely no soundproofing. When I mentioned that at the desk, they immediately offered to move me to a non-connecting room. I found that keeping my air conditioner running (set it to fan) was enough white noise to drown out most of the noise from the connecting room.","Boulder, Colorado","jjrkeenan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",0,5.0

We stayed at the White Sands for under an hour, and decided to get a refund and change hotels. The room was pretty dumpy, it didn’t feel like the safest place, and our room did not look anything like the photos on the website. However, our main issue was the wifi. Before booking, I’d read mixed Tripadvisor reviews about the wifi here, so – twice – I utilized the online chat feature on the White Sands website to ask whether there was in-room wifi. Both times, I was told there was. Unfortunately, this was false advertising and when we got to the White Sands, there was no in-room wifi. It’s only accessible from the pool or lobby area, which is not ideal if you need to frequently use the wifi, or want to use it late at night. Other Tripadvisor reviews mentioned that you could access the pool wifi from your pool-facing balcony – we could not. Fortunately, we were able to receive a refund with no issues. This hotel is fine if you need to stay one or two nights on a budget, or don’t need to use wifi.

All matched my requirements. So let's begin with #1 location: It is well situated right around the corner from the canal in a safe neighborhood - far enough from the busy Waikiki main streets, but very close walking distance to it and the ocean. There's a lot of restaurants and markets within minutes of walking. #2 Price: I paid way less than other hotels in the area (I shopped) for the quality of the hotel - it's not a modern or a luxury place by any means. Great news! No bugs were found. It definitely needs an upgrade, but the room, bed sheets, towels were clean. There was NO weird smell upon entering as some older hotels do! #3 Kitchen: Although it was a super small area, it did have some pots & pans, plates, cups, glasses and utensils available. The refrigerator was a typical mid size one, enough to fit two days worth of food for 3 people - I cooked breakfast everyday. The sink did not have a garbage disposer and they only provided a cleaning rag not a scrubber with dish soap with limited counter space to dry your dishes in the dish rack. I have to say though the staff was truly friendly and very helpful - they help me plan my sight seeing trip for the day by bus. I had lots of questions and each time they answered them quickly and they even resolved my issue (there was a water leak from the upper unit's air conditioning on our balcony) which they fixed immediately. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The air conditioning worked well. And the swimming pool was clean. Some Con's: If you are a light sleeper or noise sensitive, do not get any rooms that are by the entrance (I was in room 236), because it sounds like someone trying to open your room door throughout the night. Second, they do not have screens on their patio doors, at night I was worried to keep it open fearing bugs would fly in, which is too bad, since there was a nice breeze. The Wi-Fi was not very strong, but workable. No elevators, so if your bags are heavy you'll need to lug them up the stairs. Would I stay again or recommend this place? Absolutely! If, you are on a budget trip wanting to be near the heart of Waikiki this would be a very good choice.","Huntington Beach, California","annelulab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, California</strong>",14,4.0

When we checked in we were disappointed with the condition of the room, but we were in a hurry to drop off our bags and go, and we figured it would be fine for one night. By nine o'clock that evening, I was checking Priceline and very seriously considering paying for another hotel.Our problems included the following:1. The room was in very serious need of updating.2. Our room #133 was on the first floor at the front of the building, the only room between the lobby and the main entrance - across the hall from an ATM and the parking lot, and steps from the smoking area outside. There was no soundproofing through the flimsy door and we were kept up ALL NIGHT by noise from people outside our door - from partiers returning at 2 am, to people trying to use the ATM at 3 am, to three tour bus loads of guests:tourists standing right outside our door waiting to load between 4-7 am. I told the front desk about this and they said they can't do anything about the tour buses. Smokers talking outside all the time and the noise from the cars in the lot.3. There was a set of sliding doors to a sad little patio surrounded by concrete walls. The sliding doors wouldn't not close all of the way at the top, which meant we couldn't lock the doors and that gnats were swarming into the room. There were wooden 2x4's on the rails at the bottom to keep someone from opening the doors, but between that gap and the flimsy front door, my kids were scared to be in the room, and it honestly made me nervous, too.So, good location and I can't speak to other rooms in the hotel, but we would never stay here again based on our experience. We stayed at Ilima next door at the beginning of our trip and would recommend that instead.","Cleveland, Ohio","LizD99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",27,1.0

We are both seasoned travelers and there is no where else we would stay except here in Oahu. We enjoyed it so much that we stayed for two weeks. We were made to feel like a part of the Ohana (family). Oh, and respect the Alohaness, listen to the staff, get their advice and leave tips in your room for the room service staff. These simple social graces will be returned in kind with great courtesy and thoughtfulness.Internet is available in your rooms if you seriously need it for work. If you brought a laptop, show it to the staff and if you are staying for a while like we did, efforts will be made to get you in room internet access, depending on availability.Parking is a hassle, but parking is a hassle everywhere in Honolulu. Highly recommend using Zipcar in Waikiki. The location is only a 15 minute walk away and you walk through the beach to get to your car. Worked really well for us. For those trying to decide if a car is needed. Yes, a drive to North Shore or Makaha is well worth the cost, at the least until the train is finished.Special Mentions:Brandon, Clifton, Blake and Leilani and every staff member!Full Review:Fifteen years ago, I moved away from Oahu to the Mainland and beyond. I thought my stay at White Sands Hotel would be bitter sweet and I predicated that I would be annoyed by the Waikiki tourist traffic that as a local you simply avoided. It’s my first trip back to the islands and mostly I wanted to show to my partner the place where I became a man and share with her a large part of my upbringing. I was really worried that this was going to be hard living in Waikiki. Well, this hotel really showed their Aloha spirit.1. Free Room Upgrade. We had the floor that we requested and were upgraded to a pool facing room. 2. Wired internet was installed to make our cloud commuting work a bit easier.3. Onsite coin laundry was clean, well maintained and very inexpensive and never crowded. The cost included DVD rentals were a great treat too and you can get them on your way back from laundry. 4. The Spa (hot tub) works perfectly. To get lots of bubbles, press the button. The wildlife and waterfall was amazing and they are real versus planted yesterday at other resorts. When birds come into your room to check things out, you know you are in a special place.5. The kitchenette worked brilliantly and saved us 40 USD a day on breakfast. Seriously, Eggs & Things Waikiki now charges 20 USD for a waffle, local boy was shocked. Various small shops for Spam Musubi and groceries were next door. Larger groceries also within a slow 10 minute walk.6. Bus 13, 2, 6, 8 stops 2 minutes walk away from hotel. Very convenient. Double check with staff for best routes to take. Hotel also kindly calls for taxis and they arrive very fast.7. Free Ala Moana Center shuttle is available and there is a website to see where the shuttles are so that you can go to the stop without waiting too long. The staff, Leilani in this case was very knowledgeable.8. As any neighborhood of distinction on Oahu there is a set of Asian restaurants. All of them are good and they are all neighbors of the Hotel.9. Dance Club, and other adult entertainment is also conveniently located near the hotel.10. Safety was taken very seriously, and the security guards were nice. One even helped to watch our groceries as we returned our Zipcar. From Partner: 11. She loved the free good quality lotion, and shampoo and conditioners and soap. We goth had long hair and so had to ask for more than the standard number. Had no problems. 12. Room was very very quiet since its on the Canal side and our room faced in to the courtyard. 13. The Air Condition worked really really well. It was loud for the first 5 mins and then it was quiet. The vents were also very clean. We only used for two really hot days. Otherwise use the windows and the lanai and let the Trade Wind do its cooling. 14. Its a slow 10 minute walk to the beach through Duke's Lane. 15. Breakfast on the Lanai is a must.16. Safety Deposit Box and Ironing kit were in good shape.","Cambridge, England, United Kingdom","Scourge-of-God</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, England, United Kingdom</strong>",16,5.0

If you are a luxury traveler looking for a 5-star resort experience, this is NOT the place for you. However, if you are like me and are looking for affordable, clean, safe,and superbly located lodging with a SUPER friendly staff, this is a great option in Waikiki (and only 10-15 minutes from the beach). The great: Amazing staff; shout out to Blake and Brandon for the ""Aloha Spirit""; pool and hot tub surrounded by beautiful flora and fauna (plants, trees, waterfall and pond with koi); kitchenette in room with sink, 2-burner stove top, small fridge, microwave, plates, utensils, pots/pans, coffee maker, and small breakfast table with 4 chairs. cold A/C; plenty of hot water with great water pressure; comfortable beds with three pillows each (LOVE THAT!); a lanai (patio) for enjoying morning coffee and the outside (we had a pool view and was worth the extra fee); amazing location: close to affordable dining options with many different choices, close to shopping, and close to beach (10-15 minutes to Gray's Beach/Sheraton Hotel Beach. The Good: A dresser to put away clothes which I do when I stay at a hotel for longer periods of time; a large closet with plenty of hangers to hang clothes; a safe in the room; a nice surprise--usable drawers in bathroom to store toiletries/keeping counter clean; TV with Play Station (to use as DVD player); free video rentals, part of resort fee (we watched a movie every day at the end of our day); although we were near the pool, it was never loud or annoying; don't pack soap, shampoo, and lotion, the hotel provides plenty and it worked well; plenty of outlets in every area (except for right next to the bed) but at least we had several outlets to charge phones, cameras, itouch, etc.--no fighting over outlets. They have coin operated washer and dryers (and a vending machine for laundry soap). Knowing this, pack lighter. I washed and dried (and bought two packages of soap) two loads for $7. This was very helpful after hiking and getting mud and sweat everywhere!Let's be realistic: In some ways the rooms and hotel are dated. But ask yourself, ""Am I in Hawaii for a designer hotel experience or for the natural beauty?"" A bit dated, but the room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and affordable. Parking is VERY limited and costs $25 per day (in addition to the daily resort fee of $10/day), but I always had parking every day without issue. I felt more relaxed knowing the car rental was safe in the hotel parking lot. The kitchen is handy but you will not be cooking gourmet meals in your room. The electric stove top runs hot and you only get one small frying pan and 1 small pot with limited cooking utensils. We stuck to eggs and sausage and milk and cereal for breakfast which saved us TONS for the week. The coffee maker was older but it worked (here's a hint: buy coffee at the Food Pantry, but either bring or buy coffee filters for a 12-cup coffee maker). There is a Food Pantry about a 7 minute walk away. It is in Waikiki so be prepared for pricey food, but still cheaper than eating out every meal. No tub, only a shower, but the shower has a hand-held shower head with multiple water flow options. Let's no forget: great water pressure with lots of hot water. Many people have complained on reviews about the ""loud"" A/C unit. It is a window unit and it was not very loud at all for a window unit. Trust me, I have been at hotels that had units that sounded like jets taking off. I am just thankful that the A/C unit worked and kept up nice and cool. There is no free wifi in the room, but usually got it when sitting on the lanai. But again, why are you in Hawaii? Not to play on electronic devices, but rather to explore its beauty! The Bad: I do not have any negative comments for this hotel. I loved it here and would stay here in a heartbeat. It was our oasis at the end of each busy day. I highly recommend this hotel for budget travelers who are looking for that imperfect gem that makes any travel adventure better.","Austin, Texas","LadyWanderLust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",61,5.0

We spent quite a bit of time lolling about the pool - always clean. The linen was always clean - albeit a bit threadbare but who cares - the towels were fresh everyday. Some Americans we met who were holidaying there were amazed at the price and the convenience of the hotel. We had a supermarket, Starbucks and other restaurants close by but even better we had literally a 4 min walk to the beach. We were originally given a 3rd floor room but as I was travelling with my 79 year old Mother and no lift we shifted the next day. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and it was all done within 15 mins. We had a kitchenette which saved on breakfasts and we also stored food for meals at the beach or around the pool. Forget the other reviews. Stop complaining about the little things and enjoy the hotel for what it is - close to Waikiki Beach at a 1/3 of the price of what you might pay elsewhere. Maybe the only down side was that a small window above the air-conditioner did not have a curtain but we adapted and slept really well.

The rooms with views face the pool. The other rooms face the street, stairways, or the adjacent hotels. The kitchenette can be useful if you are staying several days or have leftovers from dinner that you want to finish later. The hotel charges a resort fee which includes in-room internet access. You have to request that a cable modem be installed in your room. Your computer will need an CAT5 Ethernet port to connect to the modem via a cable. Free Wi-Fi is available in the lobby. The hotel also provides an in-room Playstation game machine and free DVD rentals from the kiosk in the lobby.The staff is very friendly and helpful. They promptly took care of our requests.The location is excellent. Major shops, restaurants, bus stops, and the beach are within walking distance. The biggest downside is the limited parking. The hotel has only a dozen parking spaces on its property and charges a hefty $25 daily fee for a space. There's a public parking lot with a dozen spaces across the street from the hotel, but a space might not be available when you need one. Parking cost $8 for 12 hours. Street parking is almost impossible to get near the hotel. Overnight street parking is free until about 7 AM. I don't remember the exact time. A parking structure is available a few blocks away.

The neighborhood is mostly fine, though we did have an encounter with a rambling, intoxicated dude -- but that's pretty standard for the area. I didn't feel unsafe.We stayed in a ""moderate"" room on the first floor (room 109) -- I would definitely recommend requesting a suite/kitchenette room, or a ""pool view."" Our room was dingy and dark, with one window -- the view out of which was the a/c unit of an adjoining room. The room was definitely old, with worn carpet and an overall aged feel, but clean (housekeeping did a great job, except for the day they didn't empty the garbage... but that was our fault, since we rearranged the room and moved the can on them!) The layout was really odd, and definitely didn't utilize the (adequate) space well. We ended up rearranging it to try to make more usable space, and that seemed to work... though the strangely-placed bathroom wall was something we couldn't fix! Bed was surprisingly comfortable. Air conditioning unit was noisy, but I actually liked the white noise, so it didn't bother me. Walls are very thin, and you can hear everything (including housekeeping vacuuming the halls at 8am.) The bathroom had a very small shower stall - might be a problem for someone who is very large, but we're not tiny people and were okay. Definitely one at a time, though, haha. Water pressure was decent.  Rooms come with a Playstation 3, which is a quirky little perk - ask the desk for the controller, if you're into video games while in Hawaii! We got a little peek into some of the rooms on the pool side, and they looked larger, brighter, and definitely had a better view, as well as a little outdoor patio/balcony space (we did not.)The pool area was nice, if basic. We didn't go in the pool, but it was clean, open 9am - 10pm, and the water wasn't too cold (dipped a toe in!) We did use the hot tub. It was difficult to get the jets and bubbles going, and we were only able to turn them on once. The water was a nice temperature, though, and it was relaxing. The hotel makes an attempt at landscaping the pool area, with a koi pond (not enough space for all the fish, though, which is a bummer) and waterfall (you can see the canvas and pipes, but A for effort!) There's some greenery, which is lovely, and there's a new (and beautiful) flower arrangement nearly every day in the lobby. Definitely saw some roaches roaming the darker corners of the hot tub/pool area at night, but what do you expect? It's Hawaii. No bugs in the room.Staff was helpful, polite, and efficient.There's a laundry room on site for guests, which was actually really helpful. Reasonably priced, also.Overall, it was a pretty average experience.

I was aware going into it that it wasn't going to be a 5 star hotel but man was this place gross (details later).First off, please be aware that you’re not allowed to have guest in your room what so ever (only registered guest can be in the room at all times)!!! And trust me they do not mess around, this eventually got us evicted from the hotel (so dumb). How can you book a hotel room and not be allowed to have guests (eventually learned that it's a common thing in Waikiki). However we ended up booking The Aston and the Holiday Inn after the whole ordeal and had absolutely no issues even with bringing other guests (do not understand).Service was just horrible. The security guard (he did not like the LGBT crew) was so up tight and took his job wayyy over beyond serious (you’re not a real cop). Umm hello, people are on vacation: relaxing and partying to be expected, duh. (Ugh, the security guard was so annoying). Upon check in, they informed us they would upgrade us then right after they said that they took it back (whatever). Front desk was friendly but rude, you’d ask a question they would sarcastically answer which got very frustrating after a while. The night front desk guy was just as horrible as the security guard (okay over it).The room was gross! I swear it had not been cleaned before we checked in. The green carpet was dirty, moist and smelly. The beds weren’t comfy and the sheets seem like they hadn’t been changed in days. And omg, don’t even let me get started with the bathroom (the shower!!!) I couldn’t even bare to go barefoot because of how disgusting it was. Location was great (why we booked it) but it’s on a major prostitution and drug central street. So don’t expect a nice walk home at night, trust me, I thought I was going to get shanked (too scary)!! Overall, it is not worth the money. I would strongly advise to spend a few extra bucks to get a nicer hotel and better service. They will leave you with such a bad taste in your mouth.The eviction notice was given to use claiming that we were trespassing onto the property as unregistered guests (umm reservation was under our name) and having guests over. The hotel gave us ten minutes to pack all our stuff and kicked us out at 4AM onto the streets (hella sketchy streets). Refused to give a final bill and even the real cops were like I have no idea what is going on (the whole situation was so dumb). Either way, don’t want to blah blah too much about it but thankfully my bank is amazing that I explained everything that happen and they refunded me the full amount.

When I went to retrieve one of her items and noticed the vehicle gone I thought it must have been stolen, certainly the property in which I am paying to stay on wouldn't have a registered guest towed, I have still not been given a reason for such an abuse. We were told from the onset that extending would not be a problem if my daughter had extra days ""free"" due to scheduling. The morning of our original scheduled check out, I did inform Christina at the front desk that we would be extending, she said that was not a problem, just come down and sign for the extra nights when I had time. Before it was even humanly possible to put shoes on the both of us and walk down the phone was ringing and I was now told, that I would not be able to extend due to my delay.......We were now forced to pack and leave in a taxi to retrieve our vehicle near the airport ($35) and pay for the tow ($175). I have tried and tried to reach someone within their organization to help me resolve this issue and have gotten exactly nowhere. In all my years of living in Hawaii I had never really known the sting of what it meant to be a ""haole"" to some of the local islanders. Hands down the worst hotel experience of my life and that's saying something considering my insurance normally puts us up at random sub standard hotels near the hospital.","Kihei, Hawaii, United States","rln555</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kihei, Hawaii, United States</strong>",15,1.0

Airconditioning systems going bizerk in every unit! Morning garbage trucks in the adjoining street.

A short walk to the main street and you would find restaurants and shops. So, you would have no problems even if the room did not come with breakfast.A little bit of concern was when it rained.

The location is good, but for us, that's where the positives stop.On top of our room rate, there was a ""convenience charge"" which included ""in-room internet access"". When we asked about it, we were told that there is only internet in the lobby. The lobby was not really much and certainly wasn't set up for all guests to access the internet. No proper seating for using a laptop.It is not acceptable to charge people a convenience fee and not actually provide one of the main services that the fee supposedly covers.The block was meant to be non-smoking, but someone was definitely smoking on our level (Floor 2). The building smelt damp and didn't feel very clean. There was some sort of strawberry fragrance being used to mask the dank smell. In need of some serious renovation because when the paint is becoming damaged and scruffy the cleanliness level also declines. We did not feel that the floor, kitchen, or bathroom were clean. The doors all had grubby hand marks around the edges. That does happen with older buildings and hence why we say it needs a makeover. They are in the process of upgrading the furniture, but if I owned the place, I'd be replacing each block one at a time with something modern and practical with an elevator (we had to climb stairs with our luggage - although the staff did help us). I suspect they are waiting until the place falls down before replacing it with a high rise. We also couldn't get the phone in our room to make a local/toll-free call (also one of the things that the convenience fee was to cover), so asked reception to ring a taxi contact that we had. We had been offered a fixed price back to the airport by the same taxi driver who had collected us. We intended to use him again. The staff member at the White Sands convinced us to use his recommended taxi driver (he was making the call on our behalf remember, because our room phone didn't work!). The recommended driver wanted to charge us more for the trip to the airport even though we had told the staff member that we were happy to use our previous driver. The hotel recommended driver accepted the trip at the same price, but his vehicle was a very rough, patched up stretch limo. Driver was friendly, but we wouldn't have chosen his service if we hadn't felt coerced into it.

Among the positive is it's location and friendly service as the front desk staff made us welcome and went out of their way to answer questions and let us know of upcoming events in the area during our stay.Thr room we had was comfortable and clean with a small kitchenette area stocked with cooking and eating utinsels. As with most area hotels some amenities you arre going to pay for, parking here was $25 per day, and it's limited to first come first served. So you may endiung up parking some distance away. We didn't rent a car for this trip and relied on the local activities to provide transportation or used the public transportation. The traffic is quite congested at nearly all times and there are numerous one way streets to negotiate.As mentioned in other reviews they are in the process of updating some of the furniture, I had no problems with the slightly worn furnishings of our room.What could be improved is the overall appearance of the property with painting and basic maintenance. The hot tub was out of order and appeared to have been that way for some time. The pool was in good shape but the concrete decking in that area could stand refinishing. Nearrly all rooms had a lanai with basic chairs and tables. The landscaping in the interiorf the property was in good shape and featured a waterfall and small goldfish pond.At no time was I worried about our surroundings or the local people that may be in the nearby bars.There are lots of homeless folks in the area but they were not on or near the property and we weren't approached by anyone asking for anything.This property is located within easy walking distance of the beach, but because of that the prices are more reasonable. Don't come here expecting a five star upscale hotel you will be disappointed. But it is a nice place with friendly people.I suggest asking for a room facing the interior pool area, some of the exterior facing rooms will not have a decent view.If you are coming to enjoy all that Oahu has to offer, this is the place for you, if you are wanting five star accomodations look elsewhere.I would have enjoyed some different types of packages that would have helped in decision making, for example a package including a shopping credit at the local Food Pantry would have been handy with the kitchenette feature. Other packages combined with activities would make the property more attractive to those one stop shoppers.There's so much available to do in the area but you have to peicemeal it together yourself, packages using all inclusiveness make it real attreactive to guests.There's a website www.inngine.net that's all about building hotel packages and using business partnerships. Some of these packages would have been great at featuring the property against local competition.Overall I would return to this property as it offered everything we were looking for.","Shipshewana, Indiana","Rob P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shipshewana, Indiana</strong>",5,4.0

My last stay on Waikiki’s dystopia was at the Trump Hotel, but I capitulated to a friend whose ex-wife had invested decades lowering his expectations in the name of frugality. Not that I’m too good to stay off the strip where the Honolulu homeless dwell, there is ample room in my life for all sorts of two-star things. But it has been too long since I so thoroughly internalized the aphorism that “less is more”. And by that formula, the White Sands is sheer abundance. What in lacking in the actual rooms is more than compensated by the place’s totality of charm. If gritty means courage and resolve, the air conditioner that struggled to cool me all night deserves a medal, although the old dear did not suffer her years of service quietly. I admired the honesty that is uniquely communicated by a blanket and bedspread that challenges you to guess when they were last washed, like a flirtatious oldster insisting you guess his age. Did I really want to know, would it make a difference, these were my questions when I fell into a deep and comfortable sleep on my twin bed boasting its new pillow. In the morning, I was greeted by an energetic sun pushing in through the sliding balcony doors that conscript the outdoors into enlarging the already generous room dimensions. I felt a neighborliness with the homeless woman who pitched her yellow inflated pool mattress next to the dumpster she had chosen across the way, although neither of us waved, both aware we were mere transients. I was lured to the clean and inviting pool deck, backpacker girls swimming around with an air of abandon, the poolside tables with umbrellas and palm trees competing to shade me, and the birds chanting out their tourist favorites. The front desk staff, including the night security guard who reminds the homeless of the hotel’s guest-only policy after 10pm, all had a smile, even a quip, in welcoming us. They readily extended my checkout time by an hour, but even 1pm was too soon a departure from this grand dame. I may never stay here again, Trump may well get me back in a hedonistic moment. But when I am eating the evening Trump pillow chocolates I might reminisce about the White Sands, and harbor a resentment that perhaps Mr. Trump is overcharging me.","Key Biscayne, Florida","LLFauntleroy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Key Biscayne, Florida</strong>",87,3.0

I just read the review previous to mine, and I disagree with many things that reviewer said. Yes, the property is old, but clean. There is no elevator but it's only 3 floors. It was likely built in the 1960's back when the whole neighborhood were all 3 stories and folks didn't complain about a couple of flights of stairs. These older retro hotels are all disappearing fast, this is one of the few left that are not sterilized high-rise boxes hundreds of feet in the sky.The previous reviewer mentioned there was no a/c, untrue, there is a/c (but not in the bathroom as he stated). It's not totally quiet because it's located in a city, but I was never bothered by noise from the other rooms, because the walls/floor seemed to be concrete built. Outside noise came through open windows (which I had open to enjoy the tropical air), but with most rooms facing the pool, it was quieter than other places I've stayed that charged more.This hotel is an oasis that is stuck between high rises, this hotel is the way it should be!Rooms came with Kitchenettes, flat screen TV, 24 hours of complimentary wi-fi (only accessible in the lobby or pool area)... but damn, you're in Hawai'i and get off that device & have a blast!Overall, the staff was great, the rooms were clean, my bed was comfortable, the week I was there, they had a tree-trimming company trimming trees for 3 days, so during the day it was a bit loud at times... but the maintenance only was a 3 day affair.Come to Hawai'i, grab a cheap room (I paid $112/night + tax), reserved 4 days before arrival. I was happy with this place - it ain't the Ritz, but spend the extra money on fun stuff!","Jackson, NH","crazyguyonabike</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jackson, NH</strong>",68,4.0

This dump was built back in the early 1960s and they have not spent any money to upgrade it.The fact that this is a part of the Aqua hotel chain was another confusing issue for me. Aquahotels are known for good value with decent accommodations, and I've stayed at three of theirproperties with no problems. The property is completely open to the elements with no protection from street noises or weather. There's no sound proofing and no insulation. There are no views and the propertybutts up against a huge parking garage. The parking here is expensive and extremely limited. The only in room Internet they have is expensive. They were too cheap to install wi-fi.  There were bugs in the room and the bathroom. This is a three story property without an elevator!The small mattress is old and lumpy and the pillow is too. The furniture is old, well used, and tacky.There's no Air Conditioning in the bathroom, just two open windows. The shower stall is small and the commode runs constantly. The lobby is hot and humid and has no AC, the pool is small and overcrowded.There's mold in the shower, and the bathroom tissue is so cheap that it makes the tissue from HNL airport seem luxurious. The carpet is old, dirty, and worn out. The rooms are small and cramped.They were charging $120 a night plus $20 in tax last Friday evening. Shame on Aqua Hotels for taking advantage of the heated Hawaiian market, and not spending anything to improve this hovel. The room clerks like Jason and Christina are friendly.

However my experience was wonderful. I loved my room #202, as soon as I opened my balcony , they waterfalls were right in front of me, and the sound was so relaxing. I had a nice little kitchen, which was supplied with all the utensils( steak knife, butter knife, forks, spoons, wine opener, can opener). All sizes of plates including cereal plate, and tea cups. Two different size pans, and frying pan, where you can make omelets or anything else you need to fry. All the workers there were friendly and helpful. The only thing is in my bathroom there was a steep elevation to get to the shower, I really mean very steep. It was not a problem for me but might have been a problem for an elderly or obese person. There was hand railing to hold on to help you up. The only thing I would like to suggest, is that you add a sign ""Please hold on to the railing when going up and coming down the shower."" Just so no one forgets, otherwise its very easy to fall especially when you are wet after the shower. Another thing is I highly recommend a ""do not disturb sign"" for the door, most hotels have this sign and it is a big help when you don't want a maid knocking on your door when you are resting.But I immensely enjoyed my stay at the White Sands, the location is perfect, the hotel atmosphere is cozy and friendly.

A fresh coat of paint, next bedding and better lighting and I'd have given this place 1 more point. The pool area was nice, however we had originally asked for a room with a pool view and we got a room with a view of the wall and a hallway to other suites - so people were constantly walking by which didn't make for much privacy. When I asked to move rooms the front desk did not make it very easy and I was given the ring-around so we opted to stay put - even though I know there were other empty rooms. There seemed to be a bit of a falseness to the good manners and kindness of the front desk, as we were only treated well after we checked out at which point we were asked to fill out a survey and told that we would get a nicer room the next time we stayed. So there is some obvious reward for loyalty here where returning guests seem to get the better rooms. The one staff member at the front forgot to book our shuttle to the airport after she talked us out of taking the city bus (which would have been much cheaper) and she never called the shuttle for us so we were stuck taking a very expensive cab ride. One positive was the manager was sympathetic to this and paid for half our cab ride. The location is great, so if you're not planning on spending a lot of time in your room and are on a budget - then this is a good option. One other warning - the walls are thin and we could hear our next door neighbor's television set pretty clearly.","Vancouver, Canada","TravelbugHugs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",2,2.0

Travelers who do not require luxury of Waikiki resort hotels can stay just steps away from all the glamour (well ;)) and from the iconic beach. The whole Waikiki district, Honolulu Zoo, and even Diamond Head lighthouse area are in walking distance. People who do not mind longer walks can make it even to Honolulu Historical district on foot! (Really. And you'll get the genuine real-Honolulu experience). There is an Enterprise rental office across the street so getting a car is easy. The location, however, equals a lot of trouble with parking. The hotel offers some parking spaces but they are both limited and IMO expensive (smthg. like 25 USD per night). If you are extremely lucky, you can park for free on Ala Wai just behind the corner or for a better price (1 USD per hour) at Honolulu Zoo. The hotel is also close to TheBus stops including services to the Airport and Pearl Harbour. We did not use taxi while in Honolulu.Service was very good and the people in White Sands helpful. We arrived before check in time and were allowed to change in the bathroom and to leave our luggage at the reception. Our room featured a kitchenette (I did not remember that from the reservation and was nicely surprised). The balcony with pool view was also very nice. Internet was not free but the price was not too high and there was a with free wi-fi Starbucks just behind the corner. Our stay was great but we got a little surprise in the form of a nice cockroach spotted in the bathroom the last day (of our 7 days stay). Until then, I had no concern about cleanliness, so this little guy really surprised me.

We were booked into a 'city' view room, but when we saw it we asked for an upgrade to pool view because the city view outlook was a concrete wall. The room we upgraded to was fine - much nicer outlook (which lifted my flailing spirits). So my advice is book a pool view room. Everything worked - good - showers and doors intact.

So, we had to haul all our luggage up 3 flights of stairs after traveling all day on our Honeymoon! Once in the hallway, we noticed a sour smell and more tears came thinking this can't be happening. We got into the room and there were so many stains I had to quit looking around! There was black mold in the shower, stains on the lamp, walls, night table, mattress, sheets walls, and more. The room smelled horribly, and there was a little twin rollaway bed in the room as well. It's our honeymoon, why would we need that? That doesn't count as a 2 bed room! After a horrible freak out and some balling, we decided to call him and let him know that we couldn't stay there.

I thought that's a bad sign that there's no hope here! We get to the desk and they said that they could move us in the morning, but that it would be the same type of room. There was no way it'd be any better, so we stared walking around with our luggage at about 2am our time, only to find everywhere booked. No one local had even heard of The White Sands, and it seemed like people were living there..Finally, my dad found us a room at the Courtyard by Marriott. We told the front desk that we would not be staying there and we'd take care of everything in the morning. They were nice, but the place was NOT!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!

This hotel was perfectly acceptable, but I guess we found it a little disappointing after having stayed in a one bedroom ocean view condo in Kona for a similar price (rooms are just sooo much cheaper in Kona than Waikiki).My husband choose this hotel as it was the cheapest he could find that included a kitchenette. He wanted to be able to prepare some meals to save on costs. In the end, we did not really use the kitchenette and both agreed that we probably should have not have bothered getting a kitchenette and instead stayed in a bit nicer property for a similar price (or perhaps spent just a bit more). I really have no major complaints, but the hotel is older (which we knew when booking) and the room was smaller than I expected (from the pictures online I thought it would be larger - but I think hotel pictures online have a tendency to be misleading that way).Pros:-Staff members are all very nice, particularly Christieann.-Waikiki location close to nice restaurants and lots of shopping-Relatively cheap rooms (for Waikiki)-Pool area was pretty. Pool was a nice temperature and well maintained (the pool is not very large, but from my research most Waikiki hotels generally have only small pools).-Rooms and grounds were all very clean.-Rooms have flat screen TV's with a good selection of channels (we were able to keep up with Breaking Bad!).Cons:-Small, older roomsAll in all, we had a pleasant stay, but I think I would try a different hotel for our next visit.","Coaldale, Canada","jennifer135</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coaldale, Canada</strong>",13,3.0

Yes, it's ""cheaper"" for Waikiki in terms of rack rates, however if you were to walk into another better hotel or looked at last minute deals, you'd have got a far nicer room for a very similar price. Ie - we stayed at Aqua Wave when one of our flights were cancelled, and they had far nicer rooms for $120 vs. the $100 we paid at White Sands.This is not a hotel; it's a motel. Built around the 40s, the rooms are white washed and haven't been updated.

We were very impressed in all areas, especially with the excellant staff members and affordability. The location is good and certainly walkable to all areas in Waikiki including the beach. The bus and trolley stops are close by if you don't want to walk around very much. The rooms are clean and functional. The bathroom was large and well lighted which I like. There was plenty of hot water too. The pool area and front desk area are very nice & quaint. Overall our experience was wonderful. Blake did an excellant job as the front desk associate. In fact, he provided superior service which we appreciate very much and didn't expect at this price point. He was always very helpful and willing to put fourth extra effort to make sure our stay was great. We look forward to seeing him again next time when we return. Christy Anne always had a beautiful smile on her face. The other employees were also helpful & friendly. Parking is the only concern that you may want to be aware of as there is only a small number of parking spaces available on a 1st come basis. Off site over flow parking probably isn't bad if the parking lot is full. I would recommend a smaller car as the spaces are small at White Sands. We had a car only two days of our stay and were fortunate enough to park at White Sands. We have stayed at so many hotels on Waikiki & this hotel gets a thumbs up in our book.

We chose it for the size, cost and location. We have been to Waikiki before so a beach view was not required. The location is perfect for not being on the beach. Visiting family required both a car and ease of getting through Waikiki to Pearl Harbor, and the access to head that way was convenient. We were happy to have gotten a parking spot. The staff was pleasant, and quickly fixed a bad television connection. The common areas were kept clean. The bed was firm, but comfortable. It was nice to have a kitchen for fixing breakfasts and snacks. The lanai was a welcome spot to relax and look out at the courtyard and pool. Our room shared a lanai with the next door room and we were happy to have friendly neighbors.From reading other reviews, it seems as some rooms may be more updated. We were in room 340 and it was not. I would give this hotel 5 stars if it were not for two things. The carpet looked okay with lights off, but when turned on, it was extremely worn, stained, and did not feel clean when walking without flip flops.

The rooms were a little older but the pool was nice and the location is close enough to the main strip but not sooo close that you hear everything. Three downers for this hotel: They don't offer free parking for their guests, so you can pay to use their carpark or there is a carpark across the road (from memory, the parking across the road was cheaper). Both have a tendency to fill up though, leaving visitors with cars somewhat stranded. Second - They don't offer free wifi and Third - we'd travelled from Aus to HI and had arrived that morning at about 10am. At the time of booking we emailed White Sands asking to have an early check in as we'd just be coming off a long international flight. When we got to the counter they advised us that unfortunately our room wasn't ready yet.

There were no baby-cots available, but a single bed in addition of our queen size was used instead.The room was excellent with a nice kitchen corner and an en-suite bathroom. The French windows open directly to the pool area.

I just wanted a basic and cheap place for my family and I to stay for 2 nights before we boarded our cruise ship and ended up being overall impressed with the what I got for the price I paid.I booked two rooms for a total of 6 people (3 people per room) and upon paying for my reservation through Hotwire, I called the hotel to confirm that the rooms we would get would be able to comfortably accommodate 3 people each. At that time, I was told on the phone that some rooms only accommodate two people (full size bed) and some can accommodate 3 people (1 full bed + 1 twin bed), so I requested that both our rooms had the 1 Full + 1 twin. The White Sands staff stated that this was not guaranteed because we booked through Hotwire instead of with the hotel directly, but they would make a comment/note on their computer to see if they could accommodate my request. At this point, I called Hotwire and all they would tell me is that my 2 rooms were guaranteed to accommodate the 6 people and I should call them if there was any trouble after I get there.When I showed up, I found that we got 2 rooms right next to each other and each room had 2 full size beds - so better than what we were promised on the phone when I called - a good thing!Overall, this hotel is not going to blow you away with awesomeness, but it's not going to leave you completely disappointed either. Dollar for dollar, I think you will be impressed. So, if you're a value conscientious consumer, I highly recommend this hotel. If you are looking for an ultra-luxury experience, book your stay at Trump International Hotel instead.Pro's:+The courtyard and pool area are absolutely stunning/beautiful.+The pool is sized well and plenty deep (7 feet)+The lobby has an open-air concept and is pleasant+The staff is very friendly and helpful+The rooms include microwave, refrigerator, stove, Kitchen utensils/plates/glasses/etc+Free Coffee+Flat screen HDTV+Great price relative to the rest of Honolulu+Centrally located - just about everything is within walking distance & bus line is nearby tooCon's:-There is no elevator and with 3 stories, this can be a huge hassle if you are hauling heavily luggage up exterior concrete stairs (in the rain)-No breakfast available, complimentary or otherwise-The rooms and hallways are dated and could use some renovation-No WiFi-Parking is limited and available for an extra nightly charge (instead of free)-Beds and pillows are below my expectations for comfort","Beloit, Wisconsin","162mikez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beloit, Wisconsin</strong>",96,4.0

We also enjoyed the location, close to the Food Pantry, bus stops, restaurants and only a couple of blocks to the beach.

Location of the hotel is good - 2 minutes walk to shops, supermarket etc, 5-10 minutes walk to the beachfront, and the hotel is down a nice quiet street. I was upgraded to a pool view room, on the 2nd floor, near the corner, which was very very nice and peaceful. No lift though - thank god for the nice staff member who carried my heavy bags!! Room was a nice size, with good shower and bathroom. Kitchenette had everything you needed, and lounge area comfortable. ‘Dining’ table was a laugh - is it meant for children to eat on - the table was right near the floor?! Coin operated laundry was good. Pool was nice to have, and clean. Now for the big 2 negatives... 1: Cleaning staff - absolutely rubbish, one girl in particular. Everything wasn’t cleaned properly, which can be ok during my stay, but when I found snack wrappers in the bedside table drawer 3 days into my stay that weren’t mine, I was not happy! 2: Wifi - it wasn’t free supposedly, but I never paid, which is good. However it was just so bad, even when I was sat right by the rooter in reception! I know we are in Hawaii, but it is 2013!!

It is old and a bit shabby and reminds me a bit of a hospital ward. There are no elevators so ask for a ground floor room if you can't get luggage upstairs by yourself. The rooms are spacious and have airconditioning and ensuites and that's really all I can say about them. Our tv was okay but the remote was not working so it was annoying to change channels, but we didn't complain as it wasn't a big deal for us (we were hardly there). I do have to say that the shower in our room had a dangerously high drop from shower to bathroom floor which caught me a couple of times but the shower itself was good - placed too low in the stall but nice pressure and heat. And look - the carpet was not that clean and there was a bit of a smell around the fridge area in the kitchenette when opening the fridge - but the bed was comfortable and we got a good night's sleep. So yeah - not a place for those who want perfection but not a bad place at all. We had a nice balcony area overlooking the pool area, which is really quite nice. The service was, and is, wonderful! Really great staff, friendly and informative. Good internet too if you are near the lobby - you have to pay but reasonable prices. That is what really makes a place like this stand out from the big, shiny hotels - the level of service is really good.The area is maybe a bit seedy (you can pass ladies of the night plying their trade on the corner and there is a run down pub next door) but it's nothing to be afraid of. The markets are very close by and it's an interesting walk all the way to the beach. I really like this area of Waikiki - would be walking close by the hotel at times even if I wasn't staying there. We did a car/hotel deal. This was great value except that the deal was with Dollar rental car. I wouldn't do that again as I didn't realise Dollar didn't have an excess you can pay with your travel insurance - you really do have to purchase insurance to be on the safe side, which was way more expensive than the car rental itself. Not the hotel's fault but I would not get this deal again - cheaper to hire a car and reserve parking at $25 a day.","Hobart, Australia","mudskippa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hobart, Australia</strong>",71,4.0

Last August we stayed at a place right on Kuhio and I was awakened every morning at 6 am by the sounds of back up alarms on garbage trucks. And the sound of squealing brakes on buses and trolleys was constant as well at that place. We did have a glich on the first night when we found the room they gave us had two twin beds! They did switched us to room with a full bed the next day but I find it absurd that you have to specify you want a room without twin beds. I also wish they offered free wifi. But they made up for that by providing us with free beach chairs and mats to take to the beach all week.

I am a travel agent and normally splurge a bit when i am on Vacation and stay at a fancy property. We wanted to do this trip on more of a budget. I had a really good look at all of the properties that could be found in this price range. I read mixed reviews and heard a lot of mixed things from my clients that I book to stay in Hawaii. I finally came upon a review for this property and was intrigued. I was really happy in my decision to stay at this property. From the moment that we Arrived the Manager Paul and Receptionist Christian really made us feel like a member of their family. There was always a kind greeting and smile a the front desk. Christian was also quite knowledgeable about day trips and fun things to do in Waikiki. We loved the location of our room. We had a pool view with small kitchenette right above the hotel Lobby. This is a great location for your room if you want to use wifi since it is located in the lobby and the signal doesn't reach all the rooms. We had quite a strong signal in our room. We loved the garden feel to the resort. It was like a hidden oasis surrounded by tall palm trees and a beautiful pool. There is a waterfall and Chinese garden located in the back of the property and the waterfall gave a calming effect while I sat out on my patio. The rooms were very basic but clean. You can get a queen bed and a twin bed if you have a child. We used our kitchen almost everyday which saved us a ton of money since eating in Waikiki can be quite expensive. There is a grocery store about two blocks away called the food pantry if you want to fill up your kitchen. There was only two downsides in my opinion was the bar located in the next hotel it quite often had people smoking on the street our front and drunk people out on the street at night. The beds were also a bit uncomfortable as well. All in all We had a really good time and I will defiantly stay here again.

If I had bottomless pockets I would stay at the Outrigger Reef on the beach but this place offers a tranquillty that cannot be found at the Reef. All the staff are gracious and hospitable. There is no more hot tub due to changes in the ADA law. Properties must have hot tubs that people can step into, so bye bye hot tubs at all smaller sites. There are 3 -3 story buildings {no elevator} surrounding the pool, tables and chairs, neat waterfall and the hot tub area which might become a wishing well-{rumor has it}, around the entire inside area is heaps of greenery that gets daily attention. There is a back exit onto Nahua street that gets you to Starbucks or the grocery store quicker. Walking back all one sees is concrete buildings and then the oasis of the greenery of white sands beckons. It is a condo unit, with a stove top, refrig, microwave and utensils for 4. There is a lot of storage space as there are many long term guests of 2 or 3 months. They offer a free DAILY paper, including Sunday. They have internet service for $4.50 for 24 hours of use that must be used up in 12 days-that would be super if there was full reception. It is quite a hassle to only have access outside your room, but it is cheap yet intermittent service. They also offer light housekeeping, I don't think they change the sheets, it's up to you. Like coffee, the 1st packet is on them and then you buy your own. There is a laundry room. There were only about 20 people who hung out on a daily basis, very quiet place indeed. Now for the downside, this is not a new or pristine property, it is old school. The carpets are quite tired, the units are old and in need of some tender loving care but if you can look past the superficial, this is THE BEST place to recharge your batteries. I have stayed at 23 hotels in Waikiki over the past few years and this by far is the only 1 that offer a true old style relaxing Hawaiian experience. It is on Nohonani, so I needs to deal with all the ""colorful characters of Kuhio, as I call them"" This is a strip where there are many bars/clubs, ladies of the pm and possible drunks; we have never been bothered and have stayed on this area for 15 years. You are a short walk to the beach, 1 block to the International marketplace that has not only goodies to buy but also a faboo food court in the back that will keep many different food cravings happy. Overall I would not hesitate to go back tomorrow and claim my chair by the pool. Such a wonderful, restorative spot I hate to share it, lest it lose it's charm. At the same tie, I want them to be successful so i can go back. It is only for those seeking a calm spot that is not fancy, doesn't have room service, doesn't offer meals or have a bar, but all is very close at hand.","San Francisco, California","SFLollyPopCouple</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",76,4.0

We were supposedly 'upgraded' to a pool view room on the 3rd floor (no elevator). The room was very dated and a bit dirty (stain on the lamp shade). The 2 single beds we were given (not very romantic) were uncomfortable, had cheap bedding, and were on wheels. The kitchenette area and bathroom needed updated cabinets. The only positives I can give is that the front desk staff was very cooperative when we left and did not try to charge us for the 2nd night. In addition the motel was quiet for the hours between 10pm and 7am as requested on the paperwork. The only other concern was safety walking at night to and from the hotel.

Once at the front desk we knew we had made a good decision to stay here for our vacation. A courtyard with pool, babbling waterfall and mature garden filled with lush vegetation looked like a throw back to a Waikiki of yesteryear. The check-in was fast. We looked through the sliding doors of our room which connected to the courtyard and wondered if there may had been some mistake. The price seemed low for a room like this in high season. A welcome Picnic Bag filled with lovely Hawaiian treats was waiting to greet us. The insulated 'Aqua Hotels & Resorts' bag served as a perfect lunch tote for our trips to the beach. The kitchenette worked perfectly, we loved our room #104 having breakfast on the ""Lanai"" every morning. The ability to have dinner or even just a cold wine at our finger tips takes away the fuss of heading out to a restaurant for everything. The Spa was always available, and we had no problem finding chairs at the pool anytime. A propane barbecue for guests was setup near the pool and the ice machine was always full. The room was cleaned at our convenience, we tipped 2$ a day and it was appreciated. Any extra towels or necessities were provided cheerfully. We could get beach towels at the front desk for free. Internet services was available. The hotel had a family feel with many customers staying months at a time, The staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy working at the Sands. The tv monitor behind the front desk had traditional Island music and dancing on it anytime we dropped by, just seemed nice! A cold water setup near the entrance was always refreshing. You could find newer and older hotels on the same street priced accordingly but the White Sands seems to be the one to stay at. The sister hotels to The White Sands, all part of the Aqua Group are just the next street over but they didn't seem to have the charm that this little hotel does. 'The Hawaiian' next door has a Pub, liquor/convenience store. The Bus, the back entrance to The International Market and most conveniences are the end of the block.

I believe there are 15 parking spaces i could be off by a couple..If you park across the street in the limited paid parking lot there is a no security to watch your car...Parking is not free at the hotel and must be paid for also...The hotel is located about 2.5 blocks away from the beach...Now if you could just pick up the hotel and move it closer to the ocean would be greatThe ugly: The bar next door has to go!!! The hotel is not really in a bad neighborhood, but the dive bar next door brings down the area...It can bring some some unsavory characters...Never saw any trouble, but yet it still brings down the area......For a budget minded traveller, this is a great hotel to stay at and would highly recommend....","Los Angeles, California","Tkt2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",46,4.0

It is definately an older hotel, with mostly original fixtures, but if you are not going to Hawaii for a luxury hotel experience this is the perfect place. The hotel staff were just amazing. They went out of their way to accomodate any requests we had and always with a genuine smile - even if it was to install a router in our son's room at 10 pm so that he could watch the World Junior's game at 2 am. We had a room on the ground floor, which was great because we could just step outside into the courtyard to have coffee every morning. There is plenty of seating in the courtyard for guests to lounge around and just enjoy the pool, hot tub, pond and the lush plants and trees.

I have been a Flight Attendant for 31 years and throughout my career I have been fortunate to stay at Hotels many people couild not even dream of staying. This includes Hotels provided by the company while on a layover and others where I received a substantial discount. Last November I began to plan my first trip to Hawaii as a full paying guest. At first I was very disillusioned as I realized how much money I would now need to put towards my room.Then by chance I came across THE WHITE SANDS HOTEL, It sounded to good to be true!~A CLASSIC 3 story HAWAIIAN HOTEL nestled in between the towering high rises of WAIKIKI. It sounded homey and AFFORDABLE. From the moment I arrived I was treated so well and welcomed. with REAL ALOHA! I am a single female traveling alone and I am very sensitive to safety. I felt very comfortable and safe after checking in. Then I proceeded to my room. All of a sudden I felt like I had my own little studio apartment in Waikiki! I love having the sliding doors open and right off my balcony were the most beautiful palm trees and the view of the pool!I turned around unpacked and honestly was torn between just enjoying the room and the view or to go out and take in Waikiki! I did both!! Here it is one year later and I am back at the WHITE SANDS and still behind the front desk are CHRISTIANNE and CHRISTINA. They are wonderful and I feel like I have friends who work here. On my way to check in today Christieanne WELCOMED ME HOME...twice!! This truly meant a lot to me. In addition the MANAGER, Paul made me feel like a very special guest.The WHITE SANDS is a charming clean safe hotel that allows you to feel like you are getting away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki while just being steps away from THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET PLACE and just a few more to Waikiki BEACH. It is also a hotel that you can clearly sees CARES about it's enviroment and about their guests. ABSOLUTELY! Make a RESERVATION at THE WHITE SANDS and see for yourself!! One last thought...Not only do I feel welcome and at home but I also feel valued.. In this world it is difficult to find people who do not make you feel like they are just too busy to talk to you. Not the case here!! Christina and I have shared several conversation ranging from yoga to job hunting!! Along with Ron who also works at night...WHITE SANDS has NO' KA OI STAFF!!!ALOHA and MAHALIO!!

This hotel is located approximately 1 and half blocks from Waikiki Beach and half a block from the International Market Place and about 15 miles from Honolulu International Airport. This location is also a block from the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and Waikiki Shopping Plaza and half a mile from Honolulu Zoo. Check in at Hotel was fast and staff at front desk were always friendly. Front desk staff at my check in was lady name of Christie I believe. Very nice and helpful. Give high praise for her great efforts and customer service skillsLocation is within walkind distance to Waikiki beach and many places of shopping and eating. There is a convenience store just one second from hotel and a bar next door to which makes it all very close. Room had a balcony that was nice. Also rooms were very nice and big and clean. Nice tv and beds very comfortable. There is a nice pool with hot tub for all guests.However staying here like other properties in Waikiki the costs go very high.Parking you pay $25 a day and get a small spot that is only on first come first serve. However keep in mind that this is Hawaii, as other properties charge way more for their services.You are getting a good deal at this property.You are not guaranteed a spot everytime.Parking lot is very small, and when full almost impossible to park. It is so small I got into a small accident with another guest’s car at hotel. Was not a pretty scene. However not hotel’s fault.That being only one negative of this property. I like mention some more positives.Very welcoming property and nice place to relax after a long day of exploring the island of Oahu. Close to all entertainment and easy to find when arriving into Honolulu, especially if your driving. Was not hard to find using GPS or even regular map.Overall I would recommend this property to other travelers to Hawaii. Would recommend to singles, couples and groups.

We were tired and just wanted to get to bed. I hopped into bed and knew immediately that it was going to be a long night. The bed was not only extremely hard, but I could feel every spring in the mattress. It was not a restful night. There were also dark hairs on the sheets, and I do not have dark hair. That grossed me out a little. We had the same problem in the bathroom with dark hair on the floor and sink. Since the hotel was booked, there was no hope of a different room. So, the next night, we asked for several blankets to pile on the bed so that the springs could not be felt. This did help, and staff was very willing to help us out with the extra blankets. I will say that people were friendly there. The room in general was not very clean and most importantly, the bed was truly awful!","Plymouth, Minnesota","JoAnn C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, Minnesota</strong>",3,2.0

We've been to Waikiki 8 times now and have always attempted to find a good deal on our hotel room. (The lower our overal cost, the more frequently we can go back). This hotel fit our budget perfectly and actually offered more than some of the more expensive places we've stayed at. Our room was spacious, had a nice big bathroom, kitchenette with everything we'd need to cook and a beautiful lanai overlooking the courtyard/pool area. The room was clean and housekeeping staff kept it that way. The pool was very nice and there was a covered jacuzzi surrounded by trees...... that was a nice touch right before bedtime. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Jason and Christieann made us feel especially welcome and seemed more like friends than just another couple of employees. I would have preferred a hallway entrance to our room instead of an outside door, but it was no big deal. This is an older property, but that didn't bother us at all. We spend our time out and about as opposed to sitting in our room looking at the amenities. If you want gleeming chandeliers and lobby floors polished like mirrors, there are plenty of places in Honolulu that have those things and they will be more than happy to take your $200 - $300 for every night you hang around. I would certainly recommend this hotel, but be sure to request a room on the courtyard side. All-in-all, we liked it.","Victoria, Canada","Brian H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

What it does have are clean comfortable rooms with kitchenettes, AC, and large lanais. It is somewhat of a throwback to old time Waikiki, when the area was populated by low rise bungalows instead of the high rise luxury resorts that predominate today.Although we didn't take advantage of the common area facilities, the pool appeared to be well maintained and there was a gas grill available in the patio if you wanted to grill your own steaks or teri chicken. The Food Pantry is a block away if you want to shop for your own food. In our case, we bought a few cans of spam, a dozen eggs, a few potatoes, and some orange juice and were able to start off each day with a good hearty and inexpensive breakfast.Free newspapers, hot showers, clean towels, comfortable beds, large lanai, and friendly staff. And the location is within a few blocks of all the major Waikiki attractions. This place is not for the traveler who is seeking luxury accommodations, but for someone seeking a comfortable quiet place to sleep in between enjoying the various island activities. And if you want some luxury, use the money saved on your room to pamper yourself to some nice meals or drinks.Overall a very enjoyable experience and I will definitely stay here in the future.","San Diego, California, United States","John K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California, United States</strong>",14,4.0

Jason seemed to go out of his way to make us feel welcome. Pluses: the room was older but clean. the outdoor area is very nice, pool and hot tub well maintained.

Another plus, the location is fantastic, just a few hundred yards away from the International Marketplace, and about a 5 minute walk to the beach at Waikiki.Really just a couple of negatives: first, at least in our room, the AC was a small, old and tired window unit. We were there during a particularly warm week and the AC had a really tough time keeping up with it. Another downer: this is an older, lower priced hotel and it showed in the beds.

We booked two rooms with kitchenettes, we had one room with a kitchenette and the other with a fridge and a microwave- the two rooms did not warrant the same price and were not as described, luckily the rooms were reasonably closeby so shared keys and used the one kitchen, although not ideal.I had emailed the hotel before our arrival and told them it was a special trip for my Mum's birthday and requested rooms closeby with a nice view if possible. The rooms overlooked the car park and flats opposite- not my idea of a great view but then apart from looking out over the swimming pool there wasn't a nice view.The rooms were comfortable to sleep in although noise was an issue at night as doors constantly slammed and we could hear the traffic at night. We were woken up most mornings by the rubbish collection which came really early at about 5am, I sleep very deeply and it even woke me up. Not my idea of sleeping in paradise!The housekeepers came daily but the room was not clean when we arrived and was never actually cleaned! Seriously, there were bits of food on the floor not just under the sofa and bed but all over. We even found a sandal down the back of the sofa and a sock just on the floor behind a chair. The bathroom floor was disgusting especially by the toilet and there were weird stains on the walls which was really disgusting. We never felt clean in the rooms and couldn't walk round barefoot. The only way we knew the cleaners had been in the room was because our rubbish had been emptied and taken even if it wasn't put in the bin (that means it wasn't rubbish!)The man at the front desk was always very miserable and didn't seem to want to help us but Christie Ann was really friendly, happy and always helpful. Aside from the location and the pool and hot tub facilities she really is the only other positive about this hotel.I would not stop someone from booking this hotel as it was reasonably priced and is in quite a good location but just so you know what you are getting. After spending a week in Maui in a similarly priced hotel which was amazing to come to this hotel was really quite a shock and we wished it had been the other way around but we weren't to know.","Plymouth, United Kingdom","daydreamer95</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, United Kingdom</strong>",33,2.0

The ticket machine in that lot was not working so I had to park in another hotel lot on the next block that cost $25 per night. $25 per night parking is pretty standard for Waikiki. I went to use the kitchenette and found that every dinner plate in the cupboard had old food stuck too it which was disgusting. I picked up a water glass from the cupboard which was also filthy. They provided a kitchen cloth and dish towel but no detergent to clean the dishes. I would be afraid to eat off anything in those cupboards. I kicked off my shoes when I entered the room which is the Hawaiian style. After a few minutes I looked down at my socks and they were black. The floors were also very dirty. I took a cloth and wiped it across the light fixture in the bathroom it it came back full of dirt. The place is very dirty and I would not stay there again.

The security guard was amazing and said if we wanted to leave the door propped open he would make sure no one would walk in at night and guard it, he brought a boat load of towels and tried to dry the carpet. The next morning we came up to the front desk and we were told that the staff will move our bags into a new room and we do not have to worry about anything. and the new room was a really nice upgrade and all the staff was so apologetic... as I said it isan older hotel but the people working there are amazing and friendly and so helpful unlike most places we stayed in in Waikiki. the location of this hotel is actually pretty amazing, close to the beach, great restaurants and bus stops.

There was no parking garage. Even with my small economy car, it was tough to maneuver through this tight parking lot. This task was made even more difficult by someone’s long truck that was parked by the exit and hampered one’s ability to get through the tight turn. For this, you pay an extra $20 per day.We accessed our rooms by walking down a hallway with filthy carpets. It wasn’t a comforting first impression.Our “suite” came with two twin beds, a Hollywood-style daybed that doubles as a sofa, and a tiny kitchen. The beds must have had the cheapest mattresses the hotel could obtain, perched on wobbly metal frames. There was one small pillow on each bed. The scratchy blankets made me think longingly of my former Army barracks in basic training – the Army beds and blankets were more comfortable. My daughter pulled the blankets off one of the beds and slept on the daybed, as it had a slightly better mattress. The bathroom was none too clean – the floor could have used a good mopping with some strong cleaning fluid. The shower was about 30” by 30” in size. The kitchen consists of a microwave, a half-size refrigerator, a sink, and two burners. It’s very tiny, but was adequate for preparing breakfast cereal and light meals. I would have appreciated it if the kitchen had been stocked with some salt and pepper. The first night I was there, I poured some unused lemonade down the sink and didn’t notice that the sink stopper kept it from draining out of the sink. When I returned at the end of our first full day in Oahu, I noticed that the lemonade was still in the sink; the maids hadn’t drained it or cleaned it. As an experiment, I deliberately left it there the second day. It didn’t get cleaned then, either. There is a safe in the closet, which seemed like a good idea for security purposes, but you have to go to the lobby and obtain a key for $2/day for the privilege of using it. Better hotels have safes with combination locks that you can set yourself, and they don’t charge you for their use.The lanai “view” was non-existent, and there are no sheer curtains. It’s either reveal yourself to the world or have your room plunged into darkness by the drapes.The HVAC unit appeared to have a thermostat, but the A/C ran constantly, despite the setting.The wireless internet seemed to work adequately.The only reason that I ranked this hotel two stars is because one star is the minimum on TripAdvisor, and I’ve stayed at two other motels in my lifetime that have been worse. Since the locks and deadbolts worked, I didn’t feel overly worried about my safety, and at least the maids had made an attempt to clean the unit before our arrival. And the air conditioning worked, so we didn’t roast. I have to admit that the hotel was surprisingly un-noisy for its location in a busy urban section of Waikiki. If all you want is a place to crash, this might be OK, but I think there must be better budget options out there.","Perry Hall, Maryland","SML-Travels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perry Hall, Maryland</strong>",33,2.0

Room 327. STOP! Unless you are staying at the Celebrity for free … and even then...don’t even think about it. I am at a loss as to why so many people give this place a decent rating. It’s run down and in serious need of a small, controlled fire. You can easily find other properties in Waikiki for the same price. Still not convinced? Read on.Before I go any further, in agreement with some of the other reviews, I have to say that the staff here are great. The desk staff are generally happy and helpful and the room staff keep the rooms clean..and that is no small task given the condition of the things.So…The Celebrity Resort is one of those quintessential 1950s-era block motels that you really want to like. The pics on their website show the décor and the prices (starting at $79/night for a studio) clue you into the fact that this place is not high-end and that’s fine. Honolulu is full of over-priced tower hotels so finding a small, cool motel in Waikiki would be great. However, the Celebrity is not it. The website offers the following quote.. “Situated amongst the hustle and bustle of metropolis Waikiki, the resort maintains the ambiance of Hawaii as it used to be 40 years ago - where the surf, sun and sea lull you into a tropical euphoria.” Sounds great. You’re thinking Ernest Hemingway’s Hawaii and a lush plantation resort on the ocean, right? Ok, let me translate that into plain, brutally honest English for you. “Set back on a dirty street within walking distance of a bunch of crappy souvenir stores and cheap bars, but nowhere near close enough to hear or see the suff the resort, which has not been updated in 40 years –offers noise, odors and rundown interiors which send you into a catatonic state.” We stayed in room 327 and 327a. These two rooms, a studio with kitchenette and a single hotel room have an adjoining door and are combined to make a 1 bedroom/ 2 bath suite though there is nothing sweet about it. Rooms 321-335 (odd numbers) on this side of the property face the street and they are both loud and not at all private. The garbage trucks (plural… I counted three) start about 6am and then it’s non-stop noise well into the night. However, if you’re into being an exhibitionist and fool enough to stay here…these rooms are perfect as no less than 100 apartments across the street have a clear view directly into these rooms and on the patios. The beds and the furnishing in the rooms (at least 327 and 327a) are bad, thread-bare and stained. The bathrooms are outdated and the tile in the showers is cracked and perma-stained. The water pressure is quite good so there’s something positive. Both rooms have a separate AC unit to keep the place cool if you need to chill for a bit and they are loud enough to block out the traffic noise.The kitchenette in the studio has a coffee pot, microwave, toaster oven, two burner stove top and a small mini-fridge. There are glasses, plates, knives and flatware. Not great stuff but it does the job if you want to stay in and cook something simple. The common areas of the hotel are a little better but still outdated and generally borderline junk. Yes, there is a pool in the center courtyard and if you have small children they will think it’s great. The beach is about a 3-5 minute walk away and you end up beach front at the Royal Hawaiian. The front desk at the Celebrity will give you towels, beach mats, etc. Just ask.I like to stay at a variety of places and I generally prefer to steer clear of the big name hotel chains as I traveled for business for a good 10 years and stayed in them too much. I like to find smaller, more hands-on hotels and motels that offer something out of the norm. But again, this place is not it. It’s just plain bad. Do your homework. If you want to stay in Waikiki there are a number of other properties in the same price range that have invested in updating and offer good quality interiors and furnishings.",World Citizen,"myvoiceofreason</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>World Citizen</strong>",27,2.0

There was a message on my answering machine from Celebrity Resort which said we broke a lamp so they charged $55 to our credit card. I called the hotel, talked to Judy who was no longer friendly after I tried to explain to her that it might be a staff mistake because we didn't break anything. She said the charge is a done deal and I need to call the credit card company to dispute if I don't agree, then asked me to call back if I wanted to talk more because she had another call coming in. I understand that she has probably dealt with more of these phone calls than she'd like but she is in service industry, what happened to customers first? I wish Judy would put herself in my shoes to understand that a) no one likes to be accused of something they didn't do and b) it's okay to stay on the line to listen me (after all, I was the first caller) instead of brushing me off.

For me, the pros outweighed the cons. The hotel room was clean and the staff was really helpful for finding places to go out and eat, shop and do activities. By the way, check with them on what discounts the hotel gives for certain stores. You get an 11% discount at Macy's and found out about it after I had been there! Whenever I go to a hotel, I have to use the pool and hot tub. I found both to be very clean and the hot tub was especially nice at night. Everyone was afraid to swim in the pool since it isn't heated, but I found a way around that. I went in the hot tub for about 15 minutes and then jumped in the pool. It was really refreshing. One of the nights, I did some night swimming. You get used to the water after about a minute. Another thing that I liked about the hotel was the fact that the kitchenette was well stocked and we were able to go to sam's club and buy some rib eye steaks to make on the grill. You couldn't get a steak that size at a restaurant for the price we got ours at Sams! One thing that's annoying is that you can only talk for 30 minutes per night long distance in the hotel rooms. If you need to talk longer, one of the staff members will tell you about this little mom&pop store that you can get a 5 dollar calling card from. It's way cheaper than the ones at the ABC stores (which are EVERYWHERE!). With my card, I was able to talk for 17 hours. That made me happy :-). When you walk out of the main entrance of the hotel, take a left and it should be on the left side. You'll walk past a bar and another hotel but it will be on the same block. You can't miss it. Another downside that annoyed the living cr*p out of me was that the shower head is only about 5 feet from the floor of the shower so even most women will get really frustrated with trying to take a shower in any of the rooms. This might be a deal breaker for some people but I was willing to put up with the inconvenience. Although, I'm 5'9 and I was SO happy to get home and take a ""tall person"" shower. Another downside to this place is the location. There is a bar right next to it and I think there are some other bars that are close to the hotel as well. The noise at night can get unbearable if you insist on leaving your window open. This is especially true if your room has a balcony facing the street. And if you don't have a time-share at this hotel, you won't know what room you'll get until you arrive with your luggage. At night, my dad insisted on leaving the window open :-(. At about 2am you'll hear lots of drunkards screaming their head off as they walk down the street. Believe me, you won't miss it. But wait! The noise isn't over yet! At about 6 in the morning, every morning, you'll hear a truck backing in to some hotel and it's the loudest beeping noise you'll ever hear. Believe me, if you're an early riser when you're on vacation, this 6am alarm won't fail you. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP (x6)The last thing that I'd like to point out is if you're not used to being in a warm climate and you think it might be a nice idea to take an evening walk since the air is warm and breezy, think about what safety precautions you would take in any major city. I was naive about it and decided to take a walk at 10pm in my shorts and t-shirt. It was 75 degrees and the breeze was going. When I was heading back to the hotel, I think I almost got jumped. I was walking down the same street (nohonani street) the the hotel was on and I glanced over and there was a Hawaiian guy across the street from me walking in the same direction as I was going. I glanced over and then he looked at me. Then I glanced again and he was still staring at me. The faster I walked, the faster he walked. Then I started walking across the street because that was where the hotel was and then he starts walking to the middle of the street like he wants to catch up with me. Then I started running to the hotel and I started cursing because it was that time of night where you need to stick your key into a slot to get the main hotel door open. If you want to go out at night, ask a friend to go with you and keep your cellphone where you can reach it quickly. Also, start getting your room key out about a block before you get to the hotel. I think they close the doors at 9, but sometimes it's earlier than that. If you can, leave your ID and other important cards in the safe an only bring as much cash as you think you'll need. Another thing, the street by the canal is pretty deserted at night and I would stay away from their especially if you insist on walking alone. It sounds like simple advice but everyone overlooks tips like these sometime in their lives. I hope I didn't scare too many people from staying at this hotel. If you can get over the noise, the low showers, and be very cautious when walking out at night, it's a good place to stay. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Waikiki beach and it felt really good to get that exercise and not have to drive. Aside from the noise and the scary incident that happened to me that one night, I had a good time. And remember, check with staff if there are any discounts to the stores you'll be going to.","Auburn, WA","brinethery</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auburn, WA</strong>",6,4.0

You feel like you're in some hidden resort in the middle of the jungle. There is also 2 barbeques for the guests to use free of charge. (most hotels don't have any, or charge you per use.)The rooms were average, but clean and spacious. We've stayed in other hotels in the area, that were half the size, but cost more. The courtyard view is based on availability, and can't be booked in advance, . They assign the rooms as you check in. If you're lucky, you can get a room facing the pool at no extra charge. If you don't get one, don't be disappointed. You will still enjoy your stay, and the staff are awesome.We ended up getting a room with a city view, but it's only 10 feet to the pool, and the resort is only 5 minutes to the beach. In my opinion, you shouldn't come to Hawaii, and spend your entire day looking at the other guests in the pool, when you're a block from the beach anyway!Brian and Aaron at the front desk were the best. Both were so friendly, and they helped us so much. They introduced us all the best restaurants and all of the hot spots to go at night. They also have a great conceirge that can help you book the best luaus and dinner cruises, and they don't try to rip you offf, or upsell you on the higher ticket activities like some do.The only disadvantage was the parking. They only have 12 stalls, which are always full, but they have alternate parking right across the street for the same price.

We were in the market for a Waikiki hotel that was budget-friendly and centrally located. We had also decided that since we were traveling so far, for such a short period of time, we were going to spend as much time out and about as we could - we didn't intend to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. Essentially, we were looking for a decent place to sleep and a safe place to store our things. We were met at the front desk by Aaron and Joemar. I asked if they had a room on the courtyard side available. Aaron said they had one, but it was a smoking room. He offered to take me to see it before finalizing our transaction. I was afraid it was going to have a stale smoky smell, but much to my surprise, it was fine - no trace of smoke, and truthfully, I don't recall even having seen an ashtray in the room. We have nothing to complain about our stay there. The front desk staff was friendly, the poolside pancake breakfast was fun, the concierge service was a plus - I can't remember the young lady's name, I want to say it was Kealia - I'm so sorry I can't remember the spelling - but she was so sweet, and so helpful in getting us tickets for a sunset catamaran cruise, and tickets for Pearl Harbor. They have a small hut where they store pool toys and boogie boards - guests are welcome to take those boogie boards over to Waikiki Beach. On the Sunday we were there, we decided we were going to explore the beaches on the eastern coast, and in Kailua, we bought 2 boogie boards of our own. Since we knew we wouldn't be able to bring them back on the plane, we left them as a thank you to the staff for the awesome time we had there, and also in the hopes that other guests would have as much fun boogie boarding as we did. We only had a car for 3 days of our trip, parking at the resort was unavailable, but parking garages are nearby, albeit rather expensive, and with time limits. One morning, my boyfriend was up at 5:00 AM in order to move the car to a different location. If you don't need a car, don't get one - public transportation is reliable, efficient and inexpensive. If you're expecting the Ritz, you're going to be disappointed and I recommend you keep going, but, if you're looking for a safe, clean, reasonably priced place to stay, where the staff greets you by name, please try Celebrity Resorts.

Low rise, not fancy, fewer people, inviting courtyard and pool area, friendly staff are all plusses. The secret to this place seems to be getting a room on the inner courtyard, not on the periphery. We booked a n/s 1 bdr for 2 adults/2 kids. There are smoking rooms/floors as well as non-smoking, but the inner courtyard area is non-smoking. Smokers have an area provided in the parking lot. Service: We checked in late, so there wasn't much available except a room facing Nohonani St. Staff was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Thank you to Judy, Marie, Joemar, Brian, Jocelyn and the always-smiling Aaron! The staff were happy to book shuttles, give dining advice, etc. Late check-out was provided, and other travellers were able to use common areas until their very late departure.Most of the guests were friendly and courteous, although we encountered two self-centred jet-lagged parents who let their toddler scream loudly on the lanai at 3:30 am. The security person was already out there when I opened the balcony door. I tried to get their attention by leaning over and waving and yelling, but said oblivious parent was too busy watching TV to notice some stranger near their kid on the balcony. The security lady ended up knocking on their door and asked them to respect the quiet hours rule.Room: The 1 bdr was large, but we were disappointed that it wasn't a courtyard/pool view room. Although I asked daily about changing, it was a busy week. Facing the street, it wasn't terribly private, but it was bright if you opened the curtains. 2 queen sofabeds in the living area, so both kids got their own bed. The bedroom's queen bed was comfortable enough but seemed small. Loved the many extra pillows in the room! TVs in both the living area and bedroom, but limited TV channels. DVD player & DVDs can be rented at the front desk. The safe in the room was useful, although it will not hold a laptop computer. Air conditioning in each room was noisy, as were the garbage trucks that hit various buildings in the area. We counted 4 on Wed. (from 6 am on), and 1 each day except Sunday. The earliest one was at 5:36 am, and the driver was banging the dumpster around with vengeance. As a light sleeper I definitely needed earplugs, but the rest of the family was fine.Kitchenette: small beer fridge (used the crisper drawer for milk) with ice cube tray, 2 burner stove, microwave oven, toaster oven, cutlery (& steak knives!) and dishes. Coffee maker & filters provided, but it was more convenient and fun to have Kona and Vanilla Macnut coffee out by the pool (avail. 7-10 am). Salt & pepper provided; sugar and coffee whitener avail. at morning coffee. No dishwasher, only a dishrack.Bathrooms: the 1 bdr had 2 identical bathrooms on each side of the unit. Toilets flush loudly and run long. Shower pressure and temperature were great in the morning, although one afternoon the temp was only warm. The shower heads were really low at 5'4"", so at 5'6"" I had to bend my knees to wash my hair.Housekeeping: according to something I read at the hotel, Heavy housekeeping was done on Wed. & Sat., including changing sheets & washing dishes. We washed our own. Lite housekeeping involved making beds & changing towels on all other days. For some inexplicable reason, the maid never left extra shampoo or soap in either bathroom. We had one soap for the shower and sink area until I went downstairs to ask for more.Amenities: small, warm, deep swimming pool (4-7 ft). Pool and beach toys available in pool shack (air mattresses, tubes, boogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas, beach mats, pails and shovels). Beach and pool towels are signed out at the front desk.Plenty of tables with umbrellas by the pool, although it gets very busy during the pancake breakfast on Thurs. morning. Lounge chairs by pool. Hot tub secluded in far part of courtyard, hidden by palm trees, plants, and waterfall. NY Pizza/cheesecake night is on Tuesdays.Internet access in lobby was useful for quick inquiries. Did not use the booking agent, but it seemed convenient to have that service available. Neighborhood: Within a block of the hotel on Kuhio, you can find fast food: Subway, Jack in the Box (all day breakfast), sushi, Pukadog, Starbucks, Fatty's Chinese, Denny's, McDonald's (2 blks west), St. Germain bakery with cheap, appealing sandwiches and pastries. More formal restaurants are within a few blocks. Shopping: ABC store (with booze), Payless shoes, pharmacy (one block east), Food Pantry (2 blocks east). The International Marketplace is within the block, full of cheap ""Let's make a deal"" souvenir merchandise and a small food court. Kalakaua, the action packed main drag is a quick 5 minutes away, and free entertainment abounds at night, including street performers, fancy stores and restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, CPK, etc). Kuhio Beach (Duke's statue) is the big main beach.Just north is the Ala Wai canal - good for a walk or run. We never felt unsafe, but then, we never stayed out very late, either. The hotel is secured after 8 pm, and key cards are a must. There is an exit at the back of the complex as well.I have recommended this hotel to similar-minded travellers and will return, hopefully in the off-season.","Vancouver, Canada","Point2point</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",106,4.0

Before arriving I was a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but it didn't take long to feel right at home. These accommodations are by no means perfect but I'm giving it 5 stars because it was my experience that within just a few hours we were able to make this apartment-style hotel room a home away from home. Upon arriving we went to the front desk where Joemar and Aaron helped check us in. They were both incredibly helpful and friendly. In fact, I would say their smiles were contagious. We requested a room facing the pool area and were fortunate enough to get one. We ended up with a room overlooking the pond and spa which turned out to be perfect because it was a little more private and it was right next to the back entrance for easy in and out access. Before raving more about the good I think it's only fair to align any future expectations with the reality of a 2.5 star hotel. When we first walked into our room it's fair to say my roach motel fears didn't vanish immediately. It definitely had an unappealing musty smell. The bedroom floor had a huge iron burn on the carpet (it was literally the full size and shape of the bottom of an iron). Not once did we see any bugs of any kind inside our suite but one of our 7 mornings there we did see a single, but live, roach in the hallway. Housekeeping was pretty good but you should expect to do your own dishes (we left $3 on average for tip each day) and one of the 8 days we were there our bed looked made but the sheets under the comforter had not been touched and were in complete disarray. Now, you are probably asking yourself how I could possibly rate it a 5 after all that but let me explain. First off, never have I made myself so at home at any other hotel I've ever stayed in. By day 2 my friend and I had literally unpacked everything in our suitcases. Shirts and shorts were hanging in the 2 closets, our bathroom amenities were each stowed away in our own separate bathroom mirror cabinets. We stayed in one of the Bedroom Suites. It had a sitting room with two pullouts, a full kitchen, a bedroom and 2 full bathrooms. Since it was just the 2 of us we didn't really need the 2 bathrooms but it certainly ended up being convenient to have all the extra counter and storage space. Once the AC is running a while the smell goes away and you won't think about it again. Since we really did feel at home it didn't bother us when our dishes didn't get cleaned or the one time our sheets weren't perfect. My friend in particular is pretty anal when it comes to cleanliness and other than the initial smell and the partially made bed she had no complaints. The first night we got in we went to the grocery store down the road and filled up our fridge with sandwich stuff, eggs, yogurt, etc. Most of the days we'd get up early, eat breakfast, spend the day out and then come back to the room for dinner on the lanai and then spend the rest of the day walking Waikiki Beach or sitting by the pool. It was a very welcoming and relaxing place to return to after a long day of sightseeing and sunbathing.If we come back we'll definitely be looking up Celebrity Resorts Waikiki again.","Austin, Texas","ecm_tx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",4,5.0

We were a bit cramped with 4 people in the room and all of our luggage; used the bed and the pull out sofa bed. There is a small kitchenette which adequately served our needs: had a small refrigerator, microwave, cooktop and coffee maker. All rooms have some type of patio or balcony. Unfortunately we were assigned a room with no view so we did not use this feature. Request a room with a pool view. There are various brews of free coffee in the morning by the pool area where you can sit and relax and enjoy your coffee. Very limited parking accommodations even though you pay a daily fee to park (but this seems to be the norm and not the exception these days on Oahu). Once they run out of parking spaces at this hotel they have an agreement where you can use a hotel's parking garage across the street at a reduced fee but still higher than the fee that you pay to park in this hotel's lot. Even though we prepaid for this hotel, was charged an additional $3.99/day for a resort fee. I must say that the pool area is very nice, the hotel is located close to Kuhio Avenue (major shopping on this street; close to International Market), and not that far from the beach and the great public transportation that this island offers. The hotel has pizza parties and other activites that the hotel guests can participate in (for a fee). The absolute best thing about this hotel is the front desk staff....they were extremely kind, pleasant, professional and courteous all of the time! Although there is a desktop computer located across from the front desk that can be used by the hotel guests the front desk staff was able to provide directions and answer all questions. If they already didn't have preprinted directions available they were more than glad to print up whatever you requested. The people behind the front desk are gems! Overall, a nice hotel for the price.","Chicago, IL","HawaiiRocks08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",4,4.0

I was judging it by it's age and side street location, but I couldn't have been more wrong. We were here last week for my daughter's wedding and I had my whole family staying here, her dad's whole family and the in laws. What a pleasant surprise the whole thing turned out to be! First-I have stayed in some of the best hotels in Hawaii including the Grand Wailea and Hyatts on two islands and I have never had the service that I received from the whole Celebrity front desk crew-especially Aaron and Judy. We were tired and stressed when we arrived and ended up switching rooms after arrival in order to get a bigger room. After explaining the reason we were there and the stressful trip getting there-they did EVERYTHING to help us out. Two days later-the bride's dad arrived with his wife and 4 kids and they checked into their condo in Waikiki. I met them the next morning and the condo had been a disaster-no blakets, dirty room-just gross! I called Marie at the front desk of the Celebrity and they went out of their way to help him and got him booked into a one bedroom there. They were so relieved after a terrible first night at the condo.We ended up making full use of the bbq facilities-entertaining 40 people who were here for the wedding, not once, but two nights. The staff didn't blink an eye-just let us know our guests were their guests for the evening. I can't say enough good things about this place-it is a perfect little gem for a family. If you are looking for a fancy hotel this isn't it. If you are looking for a home away from home then this is perfect.The only downside is the parking situation. There is VERY limited parking at the hotel. We had to park across the street for $18 a day. However, parking is at a premium in Waikiki and I know most of the hotels are $22-30 a day.The kitchenettes were very well stocked and there is a market within walking distance. It is one street behind the main street through Waikiki, so everything is within walking distance. There are also laundry facilities there and beach chairs, umbrellas, floats etc for your day at the beach on a first come basis. They also had a $3 all you can eat pancake breakfast one morning that was so fun.",Oxnard CA,"bugmom58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxnard CA</strong>",10,5.0

A lot of things about the hotel are true. The service is great....when we checked in, Judy let us check out a couple of different rooms when we asked if we could get a room with a view of the courtyard. She let us check the one that was available with a view, although she said it was smaller than what we were supposed to have. Then she let us check out the room we were supposed to get that had a view of the parking lot. We ended up going with the smaller room with a view as we didn't need the pullout sofa. Aaron and Joemar also helped us out during our stay by giving directions to certain sights and helping us get our taxi to the airport. They were all very courteous and happy to help. We had no problems with housekeeping either, and our room was always clean when we came back in the evening. The coffee in the morning was nice, and the place seemed to have lots of activities for the people staying there although we didn't really take advantage of that. There is a computer in the lobby to use the internet, as well as an activities desk. The room itself....was just ok. It is obviously an older room, and it was pretty small, although it had a small kitchen, and we only really used the fridge. There was no tub (only a shower) in both the rooms we looked at. The bed was just ok to sleep in, but after a long day, it doesn't matter as long as you have a place to sleep. We pretty much kept the A/C on all day so it only smelled a little funny when you walked in, but otherwise the smell went away. The location of the hotel itself is fine. It is across the street from the International Marketplace and is just a short walk to the beach. We rented a car for one day, and fortunately found street parking on Ala Wai Blvd because we were told there were no more spots left for our car. It would have been a problem had we rented for more than one day. Overall, this is a place to crash for the night. We pretty much spent all of our time outside of the hotel, so it was fine, but if people prefer to hang out in their rooms to relax, this probably isn't the place you want to do that.","La Mirada, California","icelara</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Mirada, California</strong>",19,3.0

To start:The check-in went pretty good.The location -I don't think- is good at all. It is a block from a strip-club and at night street walkers and dive bars are right around the corner. The resort staff was a bit over whelming for my family, but they were nice. I don't think that you should have to pay $10/day for parking, seems a bit much. Also they charge a $3.99/day fee for coffee in the AM and the safe, both of which we did not use. The room. REALLY outdated. It was pretty clean, had an old smell and a window AC unit. It had to run full balst to remain cool. Small fridge in our room. Beds are small and not comfortable. Overall, this was not my ideal Hawaiian vacation and would not recommend this location.

As a woman travelling alone, I must say that it has been ideal: I got the room type that I requested (2nd floor, with lanai, facing pool courtyard). Room has basic cooking facilities - very handy. Staff are friendly and helpful, activities desk is excellent, free coffee in the morning. Best thing is the location: on a quiet side street just off of Kuhio. Amazing bakery & an ABC Store at the corner, larger Food Pantry (pricey but OK for short time) up the road, zillions of shops of all types within minutes' walk, including market stalls (beware predatory stallholders! if you act interested, they will pounce!). Walking distance to the beach, too.Only criticisms are: room security could be improved (in-room safe but no chain on door & only very basic door lock; and only 1 simple up/down lock on sliding door to lanai). Also, there is a musty smell in the room when you first enter, but this disappears when a/c is run. Room was well cleaned, no problems with sheets, towels, etc. Am staying here again in a couple of weeks, so will report back if experience is any different. BTW, hotel recommended Reliable Shuttle for airport transport, and they were also excellent.

I had to switch rooms after my first night. The pull out bed was blood stained and the small lanai faced an apartment building with a view of the tenants' garbage. The first front desk clerk I spoke to said there were no rooms available to switch. But after my travel agent contacted them, there were two rooms available that they could move us to. We were moved to another room that seemed cleaner but a similar view.Another front desk clerk, Aaron, was helpful the rest of the trip offering suggestions for dining, etc. He made an effort to learn guests' names, acknowledged anyone who walked through the lobby and offered my daughter flowers on the last day. He was a gem!I did not have trouble with housekeeping as previously inidicated by another guest. A nice little touch was a white board in the room so if you had any requests or comments for housekeeping, you could indicate it on the white board. What a great idea!The location was good, the staff were helpful (except our first night), they have free internet use with a 10 minute limit, and an activities desk to get information on the area. They also offered free scuba lessons in the pool on Tuesdays. However, the rooms were not what I expected. We ended up being in three different studio rooms during our stay (we paid $10 to use a room to shower in on our last day after we had already checked out), and none of them were the same. The ""shower room"" that we used was cleaner, bigger kitchenette, bigger lanai and bigger bathroom.

We asked for a room facing the courtyard as per previous travellors suggestions, but they were not able to honour that. I decided to go with celebrity because of the kitchenette facilities, but it was not worth it. I think we got one of the older rooms & it faced another apartment. Our AC made a lot of load noises, and the mattress took a little getting used to. The head of the bed was against the wall that separated us from the hallway. Each morning, we would hear all the noises of the hallway. The hotel did suggest we ask the manager to have our room changed, but we were settled with alot of groceries, so it would have been more bothersome to lug all of that stuff to another room. Housekeeping was horrible & inconsistent. The first day, we left $2 tip & our bed sheets were not changed, our dishes were not washed, nor was the place vacuumed. Thus the next day, we left $1 tip, but our sheets were changed, & our dishes were washed (no vacuuming though). The next couple of days, we were sick & stayed in, missing housekeeping. When we finally were well enough again to explore Hawaii, we left $3 tip (because the place was very messy), but no bed sheets were changed, no dishes were washed, kitchen garbage bin was untouched (with 2 days worth of old food in there), but somehow we got vacuuming.

Hotwire has been inaccurate with 2 of my recent bookings. When referring to Tripadvisor ratings, which they do for some of their listings, they'll be off (by up to a month) as to when the last review was posted or how many points the listing has on Tripadvisor.Anyway, I was worried about this booking because the last review that had been posted at that time indicated a horrible stay. Lots of great reviews though, so in my review I'll just focus on what stood out to me. The hotel has a 2 1/2 star rating I believe, and I'd say this is fairly accurate. If the AC in the room wasn't running there was a mildewy smell. The AC was a little noisy so I had to sleep with earplugs every night but I am a sensitive sleeper.The room was spacious enough, had a nice little kitchenette, and we did get a room with a lanai overlooking the pool as I had requested. The staff were quite nice, and Aaron (sp?) at the front desk was exceptional. He was nice and funny, always in a great mood.I always read through all of the reviews on Tripadvisor before going to a hotel and I was disappointed that they no longer have Monday night hula dancing as some other reviewers had referred to. I asked about it at the front desk and the staff member said they had stopped the show months ago. They did still have Thursday morning pancakes but no pizza/cheescake on Thursday nights.Even though I booked this on Hotwire I later found other listings that were rated with more stars and were available for less money. I probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again, but I enjoyed my stay.If you like to do a lot of active and touristy things on your vacation I highly recommend purchasing the Go Oahu card (Google it) ahead of time.

The staff at CR was exceptional, very helpful and friendly. We had 2 different rooms, first a 2 person suite, then a suite w/sofabed when our son stayed with us. Both were more than adequate and clean. The showers are VERY small. Rooms are also tight but that's what you get when real estate is as pricey as it is in Wakiki. Every inch counts. We didn't go all the way to Hawaii to stay in our room anyway. CR is conveniently located. We usually walked wherever we were going, even to the zoo, as we enjoy hikes and the weather was perfect. We did take the bus a couple of times, over to Chinatown and up to the base. The base connections weren't the best but it was way cheaper than a taxi. We made breakfast in our room with groceries from the store down the street ($4 for a loaf of bread!). The pool area is very nice; Hawaiian music in that area is a plus, adding to the tropical mood along with the waterfall.

We booked this location for 4 nights on an RCI exchange. We stayed on the 3rd floor (Rm 306??). It was an efficiency unit.  I must say that we were uncomfortable from the moment we checked into our room. We spent most of our time figuring out how not to spend any time in the room. First , the layout of the room: You open the door to the room. The headboard of the bed was right next to the door as you open it. About 3 steps later to the left is the bathoroom/closet. We came to be more horrified with this design when we actually utilized our bathroom. The bathroom has zero ventilation (if you get my drift)!!! No ventilation fan, no bathtub, just shower with shower curtain. Toilet is about 2 feet from the wet shower curtain. And your clothes share your bathroom space!! There is somewhat of a slatted door on the ""closet"". The other side of the room consisted of a sofa, kitchenette and balcony. There is air conditioniong. However, when you opened the balcony sliding door, the door bangs against the air conditioner. f you sit on the balcony, you get to listen to your and your neighbors' air conditioner. The kitchenette was nice, not in the bathroom. (Sorry, couldn't resist the humor). However the tightness of the room and the co-mingled space, literally makes you not want to deal with food in the room. The carpet was an old fashioned dark green color. It's ok when you first check-in, but as the hours go by, you notice that this color shows every grain of sand, every light colored speck, etc. Too tight of a space. Dated surroundings. Didn't feel that the room was clean. My husband misplaced his glasses. We still laugh at how horrified we were that they might have fallen under the bed. Neither of us wanted to check under or behind the bed. Luckily we found them before needing to do this. I'm sorry to say that we checked out of this hotel after 2 days. We're not hotel snobs. Our vacation just wasn't worth the hassle. I woke up both days thinking ""How can I spend as little time in this room today, as possible?"" Due to other positive reviews, which I relied on, my advice is to try get a ""good"" room. If that guarantee is not possible, I would not risk my vacation time being uncomfortable. Book something that you can be sure about. I didn't see any of the other rooms.On a positive note, the hotel staff very hospitable. Starbucks is close by.

A range of free delicious flavoured coffees,each morning to choose from, an all-you-can-eat pancake and sausage breakfast on Thursday mornings and - yes - feel free to take the little beach chairs to the beach. There is a feeling of family and community here. We loved that. As we walked along Waikiki Beach at sunset, looking at the huge 5 star hotels, we felt like the lucky ones. Just one hesitation in writing this review - what if it becomes booked out and we can't get in next year? We will be very disappointed!

Two strong points are: location and service.Long before I even set foot in the resort, I was impressed by the helpfulness of the staff. Judy ( front desk manager) and Marie were very patient with my questions, such as availability of wireless internet, rice cooker ( which was sitting on the dinner table when I first entered the room ) and arranging the same room as my RCI excahnge for those three add-on days, There is no surprise that one side of the building has better view than the other, and they were very nice in accomodating my request since it was made months in advance. During my stay, I met these two ladies plus Aaron and Joemar, who were all as pleasant and competent as previous posts ahd described. Aaron mentioned that he's been with the resort for only a few short years, and look forward to many more years of association. How often do you come across a front line worker saying that? It shows that these people are happy and take pride in their work.You just can't beat this location. I chose to use an internet cafe, and there's one just outside the back door, called Paradise Internet, on Nuhua St. It takes longer for me to get from my room to the front lobby of many big timeshare condos , such as Hilton Grand Vacation Club. For those who intend to do a fair bit of their own meal preparation, there's a decent grocery store two to three blocks away on Walina and Kuhio called the Food Pantry, which has most of what you need for a one week stay, and it's open almost all the time when I'm awake. Bus stops very conveniently located on Kuhio Ave half a block away. $20 for a visitor 4-day bus pass gets you virtually everywhere, so a car is really unnecessary unless you have a tight touring schedule and has little time to spare going from one site to another.The units have been renovated , as I noted new curtains and bedspreads. I tried hard to sniff but really cannot detect any trace of smoke. Wife is asthmatic and very sensitive to even the slightest hint of smoke. The unit itself is very clean, superior to that of Hilton grand Vacation Club. Last year, before I discovered Celebrity Resort, I stayed twice at the Ilima next door in a comparable one bedroom unit. It was nowhere as well kept, and 50% pricier.In 2007, we have stayed at Ritz-Carlton in Santiago, Four Seasons in Buenos Aires, Fairmont Banff Springs in Banff, Alberta, Chateau Lake Louise in Lake Louise, Alberta,( I have to add that the last three I got free upgrades to one bedroon suite, it's just been a lucky quarter of travelling) all arguably rated # 1 in their region, and yet I felt the most comfortable at Celebrity resort Wakiki.

Then the driver circled around and went back to the airport, picked up 1 passanger, then we left again, only to circle back again to the airport again. Where they loaded more passangers on, by this time was had been on the bus for over an hour. They had more passengers then seats, so then they had to make most of the ones they loaded get off.

From the minute you walk in the front door past the ""Welcome Home sign"" you know you are on to a winner. The lobby immeadiately transports you back in time with it's cane furniture, vintage Hawiian music and decor - all scrupulously clean.

This was easily explained once we arrived as half the rooms overlook the gorgeous coutyard with the pool, SPA and greenery and the other half overlook neighbouring alleys which are essentially the back of other shops and hotels. If you get the chance when booking definitely ask for a courtyard facing room. Ala the concierge was an absolute gem and arranged all our bookings in her friendly manner. It was lovely to meet her around the hotel over the next few days with her warm hello - she is a real asset to the hotel.It is worth checking the hotel price regularly in the days leading up to your stay as it varies depending on vacancy rate. We added on an extra night after we arrived and paid $89 for that night as it was close to the memorial day weekend.HIGHLIGHTS: a block to Waikiki beach, 2 minutes walk to Macy's, 1 minute walk to the International Market, bus stop on the corner, great pool, great SPA, lovely abience, scrupulously clean airconditioned rooms, friendly staff, car rental place literally across the street, CHEAP!DOWNSIDES: noise from a bar down the street (we were only woken twicxe in 8 nights so not as bad as it sounds), awful views if you have a room facing the alleys (ask for a courtyard facing room), musty smeall until we asked to have the airconditioner serviced then it was fine.Overall this hotel was fantastic and the best kept secret in Oahu.

It seems to be the only Honolulu timeshare location that ever has space available. When I was there the first time they said they were ""renovating"" so the hallways were pretty torn up. I thought that would explain its run down look. I was wrong about that.This time the room was even smaller it seemed than before, there is no bathtub -- only showers, the walls are quite thin, no elevators and there was a dead cockroach on the floor when we first walked in (not a killer for me - since it is Hawaii after all). The message light on our phone (right next to the bed) remained on and VERY bright throughout our stay. We were told that was the way it was supposed to be. Our A/C unit was very loud and one day it stopped working. I called about it and they said they'd send someone up. Turned out it had created a block of ice that was stopping the air from coming through. So we turned it off until it melted and then it worked again. No one ever came up to fix it nor did we hear from anyone.There is only one building that is non-smoking, but people smoked in it anyway. Our neighbor's smoke and voices came through the vents (as well as the wall).Our view? About 10 feet away from the wall and balcony of an apartment building next door, plus an unkempt alley. No point in using the balcony.I didn't find the pool or the hottub to be particularly clean so I didn't want to use them.The staff wasn't particularly helpful with the few things that I needed. The parking is very limited and it is first come, first served for the passes. So if you are one of the lucky one's whose flight comes in early you'll get one.The best part of this motel (not a hotel and not a resort) is its location. Walking distance to everything.RCI calls this an RCI Resort of International Distinction. Scares me to think what a regular timeshare would be like then. I traded a week of a Gold Crown resort for this.In the future, I'd prefer to pay for a hotel elsewhere.If you just want a shower and a bed, this may be the place for you.",,LoveTravel2026,25,2.0

The hotel (they call it a resort, which is a stretch) is located in Waikiki about 10 miles from the airport. Parking is minimal (we didn't have a car anyway, parking is limited everywhere in Waikiki and it is expensive). It is an older three story, central courtyard hotel with no elevator. The rules sign on the room door had old Ramada Inn markings on it, so I suspect at one point that chain owned it.As for the Pros: it is centrally located - you can walk to almost everything in Waikiki. The rooms are clean, basic, but clean. Our room had a kitchenette which we stocked with some items by walking to the many stores located nearby. The staff was very helpful, they do try to make your stay enjoyable. There are daily activities for the guests. The hotel has a laundry room which was good to use before going home.The cons: the building is old and shows its age. The first impression I had (and other seem to have too) is that the building is run down. The reason for that impression is that the exterior concrete is worn and dirty. The courtyard and pool concrete is also worn. The pool is small. NO ELEVATORS. parking is limited.The hotel is perfect for budget travelers, families with small children, singles/groups travelling on a tighter budget, or people looking to save money while in Waikiki and are looking for a clean place to sleep after spending the day out-and-about.

Some of people that you meet there have been staying at that Resort for more than 20yrs. So naturally all the people there are friendly. You will really have a great time if your looking for a more family oriented place. Now, if you are looking for something a little more upper calss, where you get checked in and checked out and none of the staff/guests know you or even want to know you then you should definately not stay at Celebrity Resorts Waikiki.",Hawaii,"Freedom25893</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",11,5.0

The resort manager, George, and his staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and caring. We enjoyed our stay in Honolulu and would consider returning to the Celebrity Resorts again.","La Jolla, California","Resort28728</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla, California</strong>",13,3.0

We paid for a hotel in Waikiki (at $100+ per night) rather than stay here.Only redeeming qualities are it's location in downtown Waikiki and that it is close to Waikiki beach and shopping. Property is similar to an old motel: three stories, no elevator, outside stairways with nice views of trash. Rooms small, worn, overall poor condition. Whole property in need of major renovation. Even ""free"", this property was not a good value! After flying from the east coast and arriving to this, my wife cried. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else!","Calabash, North Carolina","piratesr1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calabash, North Carolina</strong>",47,1.0
