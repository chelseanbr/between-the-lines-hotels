The style of the hotel is Las Vegas: big rooms, wide hallways, grand foyers, lots of marble and glitz. Check in was professional. We were initially given a lower floor room, but when we requested an upper floor it was quickly accommodated. Very nice - as was the beautiful view of Mt Fuji and the harbour from our room on the 21st floor.The room was big, with great beds, and wonderful amenities. It even had round bamboo sticks in the closet with which to massage the soles of your feet after a day of walking through Tokyo.My only quibble with this hotel was breakfast. While the food was fine with a mixture of western and Japanese foods including fresh fruit, the dining room was too small to accommodate all the morning guests wanting breakfast at about the same time. It was interesting to note that the foyers and public rooms were huge, yet the breakfast room necessitated guest to get a number and wait until you were called when a table became available. This issue also resulted in the breakfast buffet being crowded as people bumped into each other given the limited and poorly designed space. But that is a minor quibble we dealt with by getting to the dining room earlier. Daiba is a fascinating look into the future from the light rail we took to get there to the shops and exhibit halls. including the giant Ferris wheel (which was well worth it).",Canada,"canontnia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",310,5.0

Totally impressive. I could even sneak to the lounge during breaks of my conference held in the hotel for a cafe latte and a snack—what a lovely alternative to avoid the queue for conference refreshments.My spacious room (42m2) was on the 26th floor with a spectacular view of the Bay and the Rainbow Bridge. As with my experience with most of not all Japanese hotels, the room was well maintained and kept extremely clean. There was everything one would need: amenities including Mikimoto (yes, by the luxious Japanese Akoya pearl brand) skincare products, high-quality Imabari towels, bathrobes, slippers, bottled water, an espresso machine and, most usefully, a free mobile phone with free internet access during one’s whole stay.Breakfast was included in my room rate, chosen from buffet and traditional Japanese. I ended up enjoying breakfast with a magnificent view at the 30/F restaurant in the first two mornings and a traditional Japanese one in the third. Both choices were fabulous: great food and impeccable service.Daiba is close (a 20-min shuttle bus ride) to the Haneda International Airport, which is a lot more convenient that the Narita International Airport.

The hotel located in Odaiba which is not far from Tokyo and easily accessible by the nearby monorail. The cost of a cab into Shibuya was about $30 but I think it varies with traffic. To Shinjuku it was about $57. There is an airport limousine stop for both Haneda and Narita airports. Very convenient. The hotel also is a stop for the free shuttle bus to and from the various nearby shopping malls. We visited the Diver City and Aqua City malls which were huge! There were also museum stops along the shuttle route but we focused on shopping. You can easily walk from the hotel to the shopping complex. Also there is a convenience store and bakery just outside of the hotel on the way to the monorail station. We also took the shuttle bus to Shinagawa for 200yen. The hotel itself is huge with a great staff. Some of the staff speak English which was helpful since our Japanese was limited. Rooms were quite large, comfortable, clean and equipped with mini fridge, hot pot, instant coffee and tea. The breakfast buffet was varied and adequate with American and Japanese offerings. The cost was included in our room price so I don’t know what the regular charge is for the breakfast buffet. I recommend going to the bar on the 30th floor for a night cap. The night view of the Rainbow Bridge was stunning. Overall we were quite pleased with the room size, cleanliness, convenience to shopping and service. It’s not as convenient as staying in Tokyo and the trade off was the larger room and a resort feel to being in a huge hotel.

Good services, especially around transportation. The free Odaiba shuttle bus stops here as well as Odaiba Rainbow bus (if you want to go to Shinegawa station) and Airport Limousine Bus. Also steps away from Daiba station where you can take the Yurikamome light rail. We used this hotel as a hub as we traveled back and forth to other cities. Reason is that you can check your big luggage in and the hotel will hold it for you until your next check in. This allowed us to travel lightly to other cities in Japan.Downside: The hotel rooms/floors are dated. It is as management decided to make minimal upgrades and milk as much as they can out of the hotel until they either sell it or decide to finally spend money to update the rooms/floors. The lower floors do have a musty smell and some rooms do have ""smokey"" scents back from the days when smoking was allowed in the hotel. We've been in 5 different rooms in this hotel, so the ""smokey"" scents are not unique to a single room. Some have heavier scents, others do not. Furniture in the room is outdated. To give you an idea of ""minimal upgrades"" they did... to get USB ports, they put in plug in adapters instead of changing out the wooden bedside consoles from the 70's.There is no coin laundry.. only expensive full service laundry. Pools and Gyms are extra and expensive. I believe the outside pool was around $30 USD per adult per day. For non guests, something like $100 USD per adult per day. Tip: push the ""Do not Disturb"" button in your room. For every day, you don't get room cleaning, you get a $10 coupon for use in hotel dining, gift shops.. basically what you can charge to your room.

Internet is the worst we have had in all our Japanese hotels .Be aware!!!This is a very busy hotel over 400 guests...so be prepared to wait and queue for breakfast and reception services. You are NOT in the city of Tokyo so the subway pass doesn’t work. On the monorail. We spent an extra £50 over 5 days on the monorail , which you get from Shimbashi. The ride into Tokyo central takes a Good 15 mins Tokyo good 40 minutes , if you understand the underground.Can I give a mention to the lady concierge who really did an excellent job organising a restaurant reservation for me and my son. She organised a cake for his birthday . The restaurant did this and provided a photo for us to remember. This was exceptional. We had a great view from the Sky Tree Tower.Thank you so much you made our stay memorable.Ok, now the bad points.:The staff have very limited English.They couldn’t even say. Please wait on the 30 floor bar while your room is prepared. ... we arrived 45 minutes before check in.However the brilliant lady in the concierge came to the rescue. She really is exceptional. I say this as some who worked in the travel industry internationally, Hawaii, Brazil, USA, Singapore Uk, Spain and Italy for 6 years for Thomson Holidays. I know what good customer service should be. I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing but the Japanese are not flexible like other nations. You really can’t do this. You will have the Olympics next year. Not all nationals have “ follow the rules “ do as I say attitude “. This comes across as rude to Europeans and Western nations. Again holding you hand up in my face is offensive in Western culture. I know somethings are cultural. But remember about 40% of your business is probably from the West. All in all the hotel is in a privileged spot with a fantastic view of Tokyo bay.

Even before our stay both the reservations and conceirge desks were providing helpful information in response to my queries via email. That is a PLUS in my opinion.Their instructions to catch the airport limosine bus from Narita airport was simple and so convenient and well worth the reasonable cost as you were dropped off right at the hotel. No lugging big bags on the train.We chose the club option for our room and were very pleased with all that was included. Our check-in was very comfortable lounge to sit while all the paperwork was presented. Only strange piece came to request for payment before our stay was completed so this was very unusual for us.Our room was on the 25th floor with the Rainbow bridge view as I had requested. The view was spectacular especially at night. The room was very comfortable and larger than I expected based on other comments I had read about Japanese hotel rooms. The two twin beds were comfortable and firm which is our preferance. With club plan, we were given a one time bar set up with a couple of each water, pop, beer and two little individual wines. Each day two more water bottles were provided along with an English local newspaper. There was also coffee and tea provided. The large bathroom was elegant included a tub and separate shower with lots of hot water with great pressure. Lots of bathroom amenities of shampoos, etc.We chose to take our included breakfast on the 30th floor as the view was amazing along with the calm and quiet atmosphere. The main choices were a bit limited however the simple buffet selections also included were more than ample to round out the meal. The other options were sushi breakfast or buffet on 1st floor however as we did not use we cannot comment on those.We also took advantage of the included option of the club lounge each day after sight seeing where a selection of alcoholic beverages were provided along with soft drinks, coffee, tea plus depending on the time of day there were simple food options to nibble on. The selection was limited and not always refilled quickly especially when the lounge was busy. Our only wish was this lounge was on the 27th floor lounge which is only for coffee and tea but the view would be a true highlight to relax in.The location at first may appear to be too outside of main Tokyo however the train (330 yen pp) is right beside the hotel within 5 minute walk which takes you right to the Ginza metro line which seems to be the basic main line for all the main tourist attractions. We used this train and then the 72 hours tourist subway ticket for all our intra-city travels. We also used the water port for a harbour ride we took back to hotel as part of our sightseeing adventures.Nearby is a huge shopping centre with food courts, restaurants, convenience stores. Lovely waterfront walkways including a small replica Statue of Liberty. We also used the hotel courier service that shipped our big luggage onto our next city hotel at a nominal cost. What a blessing that was not to have to lug two big bags onto the bullet train. There is also a shuttle bus that stops right at hotel (210 yen pp) that takes you to the Shinagawa station where you can catch the bulletin train instead of the Tokyo station. We also were able to buy our bulletin train tickets which were sent to our hotel before our arrival.Bottom line, we would stay here again and recommend this hotel along with the club option package.","North Saanich, Canada","GatorVictoria_BC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Saanich, Canada</strong>",50,5.0

The hotel is beautiful and rooms are nice with amazing bay view the problem is the service. Here are few examples:- We had to wait 30 to 45 min in line to get a table for breakfast. And then finally when you get in there is a big mess and lots of food and drink trails are empty (see my picture) and sometimes you have to wait again until the staff fill them up. The second day after waiting again 40 minutes we just walked to Hilton across the street and had breakfast there. By the way the breakfast is 33,000 yen/person - If you want to use the pool or fitness you have to pay 1000 yen/person (each time) which we did. But since the pool is also open to people from outside it was always crowded and we were not able to swim even once despite paying the access fees. We asked since we didn't use the pool if we can be reimbursed they said ""oh sorry"" we don't reimburse come back later when pool is available.- We are not big fans of TV but I have to inform the TV lovers that this ""high end"" hotel has only 6 local Japanese TV channels and 4 foreign info TV and not the best one. - The staff is not pleasant but I don't blame them this is the job of the management and the hotel policy to be pleasant and professional If you really have to go to this hotel be aware that there is no Limo shuttle bus from Haneda Airport (which is very close) after 7 pm (you have to wait 11 pm) and no early morning shuttle from the hotel to the airport.

They accommodated us but after 1.5 hr, a guy approached us and asked us to leave at 330pm because we are already overstaying and we have already checked out.

Then Grand Nikko would be your ideal choice!Remember to do check on these things (if you haven't done them beforehand)1. Convert to Japanese yen. (All places except cash unless you use card to buy something expensive and don't forget to claim tax as some places sell things plus sales tax)2. Buy a Suica card. (Train card)If arriving Narita airport, you can buy the card from the machine nearest to the operator. Change to English language if you need to on the machine. You need it pretty much every day. You can request for refund before you leave the country so don't charge too much credit at once. 3. Optional- I chose to get to Grand Nikko by Airport Limousine (bus) just at their counter at arrival lounge. 4. Portable wifi- Free wifi if you take the bus and Grand Nikko also provide a mobile phone like device which you can take out with you and turn on hotspot.Amenities:You can pretty much get everything.1. Aqua city shopping mall 2. Diver city shopping mall (Gundam outside)3. Fairy wheel4. Spectacular views (Rainbow bridge etc..)5.

Hop on it and get to Shinbashi pretty much every time before you want to goto and return from other places. As you reach Shinbashi, you need to tap out and go down to find where you need to get on. There are many apps you can use to find where to and how long to get to your destination which is where the fun begins.

The night we decided to try it as we were too tired to go out it was full - we had no food that night. In the morning you have to queue to get in to the same restaurant for breakfast - and when you get in you can see there are multiple additional tables that they simply have not bothered to set - so limiting the capacity. The health club is a joke - it only opens at 7am far too late in my view and worse still you have to pay to use it. Then there are the little annoying things: The mini bar in the room has nothing in it. The hair dryer is completely ineffective.The location is poor.

This hotel is huge... I think, in more ways than one, too big for its size. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of ""any"" facilities in the hotel you can use for meetings. You're either at a restaurant, or paying for a meeting room. You can't receive anyone in the lounge. There's places to sit (stone benches) but nothing that isn't used by the constant flow of checking in or checking out people. So, if you want to do anything casual, there's a clean but really expensive coffee shop just outside the door, with a very limited selection on the menu, and there's an even more limited one about 50m away which... isn't clean (a rarity for Tokyo). Daiba is not well served by airport shuttles. The first one starts at 0700 at the Hilton, so if your flight is too early your only real choice is to take a taxi or leave the night before. It's really close to Haneda but landing or departing Haneda is more of a hit and miss when you book your ticket. The reception area is huge but service is impossibly Japanese. I use the word ""impossibly"" because the staff's english is quite poor and while they do try to be helpful, a simple statement like ""I would like to separate my room expenses from the miscellaneous"" isn't something a typical japanese client would request, so they're not well equipped to answer. They will, by default, invoice you the rack rate for their services so it's definitely beneficial to read the invoices carefully and revise them with the staff before you hand over your credit card. Apart from that, the rooms are quite clean, and housekeeping is, again, not what you'd expect from chain hotels like Marriott or Starwood. A typical housekeeper does not clean the tables, what they will do is wipe them assuming you take out the plates yourself. It is important to differentiate this. On the other hand, breakfast is never an option and meal vouchers to have to be bought separately (a costly mistake we were only told about on checkout), and the sheer influx of the number of people at the food areas does overwhelm the staff. The food selection is quite good, but there was a noticeable lack of some dairy products or other western staples (again, we attribute that to the origins of the hotel) Their menu selection for room service is quite good, and the food is more than reasonable quality. Interestingly enough, we felt that the huge portions (not typical for a Japan hotel) were much better fitted in the room service than they were in the hotel restaurants. The top floor one was too expensive (at 18,000 yen a person) so we avoided that one altogether. What else is there to say ? The Nikko is a very Japanese restaurant, run with the typical efficiency of any Japanese establishment. The staff is nice but not very responsive.

That's just a matter of taste. You want character? stay in Ryokan. You want craziness in Tokyo, lots of hotel in Tokyo are like that, heck you can get the tiny room while you are at it. This hotel are not for that, which I love.Personally I found the hotel is very good. close to malls such as Aquacity, Divercity, venus port etc. Food courts are abundant in these malls. They are all walking distance. Decent meal ranging from 600yen. If it's still too expensive you can always get food from the Family mart 24hrs just beside the hotel. If that's still too expensive.... why are you here holidaying in Japan?Stations were close with daiba station and tokyo teleport and all within pleasant walking distance with the park and flowers around (we came at the end of March). Bus stop was just beside the hotel as well if you want to ride one. The place is very connected. If you need to do some laundry and want to save some coin, a laundromat is only 10 minutes away by bus (白クマコインランドリ).The hotel also has free scheduled shuttle bus if you don't want to walk around Daiba.Service was very good, the room was big compared to the average hotel I've been in Tokyo. Free loan Mobile phone was provided in the room inclusive of calls and data, which really helps to navigate around Tokyo. Strolling in the afternoon passing the miniature liberty statue looking at the rainbow bridge among the blooming sakura... it was just perfect. All this without the craziness and bustling of Central Tokyo? Anytime! Only took you half an hour from odaiba to get to those anyway.And... if you want to go to Disney, this hotel is a partner hotel, so there is a free scheduled bus from the hotel and back. Very useful after a long day, all tired from too much fun that you can just go to the dedicated stop and straight back at the hotel.Definitely will go back here again for my next Tokyo trip.","Melbourne, Australia","pxrnm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

However, both the hotel and the area were all a bit ‘nouveau riche’ and characterless for me. The hotel had a large opulent lobby, everything was a bit over the top and soulless and it seemed to cater for your groups on shopping / packaged type holidays. The area was too far from Tokyo for my liking (but great for Haneda) and mostly surrounded by malls and new man made activities, which probably suits families with kids more.

Compared with most hotels in Tokyo rooms are very comfortable and spacious and good value for money. Tour groups tend to come and go in buses. But as independent travellers staying here 4 nights we had to use the yurikamome line to even begin to get anywhere. This line is comparatively expensive and added half an hour to every journey. The area around the hotel is all malls and places to interest young families, rather than travellers. We found it lacking character and it could have been anywhere in the world.The best part of the hotel was the Japanese breakfast, which was quiet, calm and delicious but the same every day, the spacious and well equipped bathroom and cleanliness. Staff were helpful but impersonal which one would expect in such a big hotel. The worst part was the inefficient queueing at the buffet breakfast venues especially early in the morning when there could be as many as 50 queued before the room opened at 6.30. The hotel insists in seating everyone which is incredibly slow. The buffet itself could not keep up with demand and dishes needed replacing or refilling. The pastries were nice but fruit limited.We were in Tokyo for a wedding and the hotel gave us a comfortable space to get ready but I would recommend tourists find something elsewhere ideally on the yamamote line.","Adelaide, Australia","YvonneT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",110,4.0

The complimentary free talk & data phone is a life saver! I preordered phone SIM cards from Japan Wireless and they don't work or not work at all! Love how your housekeeping staff will refill the water kettle, toiletry items (high quality ones too), and provide the complimentary water bottles every day. The privacy and do not disturb lights make sense instead of those always falling door hangers. The mouth rinsing cups in the bathroom having the lid at the bottom to catch dripping water make a lot of sense. My wife would appreciate the ""keep warm"" the toilet seat function. The design of the blinds to have the transparent one having magnet to connect, and the light shading ones cross over each other to prevent light coming in are well noted. Size of the room is also great. I'm glad I chose to stay at this hotel as I double-booked one in Akihabara close in town that is tiny and won't even fit our luggage. Also love the Haneda Airport limousine bus service as otherwise we won't be able to haul our luggages around trains. The 24-hr Quality Convenience Store next to the hotel is also wonderful and convenient. The elevators are extremely quiet which is amazing. I have lived in Hong Kong for many years and have not been in such a quiet elevator! Also love the courier service to provide boxes for us to purchase and help with mailing! The electric charger having 3 outlet ports and 2 USB ports is also a must have! The safe's size is also good that we can put in a laptop computer.DislikesBefore the trip, I tried to clarify what phone/pocket WiFi is provided for each room. I wish the staff would have told me more details as I did not realize to my pleasant surprise that it's a free handy smartphone that provides complimentary data and talk even free calls to HK and the USA! It even can have personal hotspot for my son to connect his phone for data as the Japan Wireless SIM card doesn't work on my personal pocket WiFi.I also had problem during check-in, took almost an hour. I had a booking for 6 nights and I added one more night before the trip. It must have been the default on booking.com that when I went back and forth looking at different options, the 1-night booking happened to only include 1 guest instead of 2 as in my first booking. So the staff ""argued"" with me (very politely) and spent the time calling booking.com to check it for me. As it turns out, I had to cancel the booking using my phone on booking.com and added another night there to finally make it work.

No request was too much for them. They arranged two adjacent rooms for the same price (even though there were none available after we booked the first room) via email correspondence and helped to source a birthday cake at short notice for one of our group. We chose rooms with a view of the Rainbow Bridge and this was well worth the extra cost. The views of the city at night across the bay were excellent. The Rainbow Bridge never lit up in rainbow colours but it was quite colourful. The hotel is well located right next to a metro station (monorail) with good connections to other services. There are three shopping centres only a few minutes walk away. Each has good shopping and dining options. There's a 24 hour convenience store just outside the hotel where you can buy food, drinks, alcohol and has an ATM. Some of my group had room service which they said was very good. Each room has a two outlet USB power point so you don't need a power adaptor if all your electronics charge by USB. The mattress was very comfortable but the pillows were soft. You can order different pillows from house keeping. The bathroom is well appointed with good water pressure in the shower (step up into bath tub). There's a free mobile phone in each room which was very handy. The free wifi was quick and reliable. I only have a couple of minor suggestions for the hotel. 1. There should be more free TV channels available particularly for English speaking guests (no excuse these days with technology). 2. Charging ¥100 for 10 minutes and ¥20-50 per page to print from the hotel guest computer. This should be provided free to guests wanting to check in flights online and print boarding passes.

Our triple room wasn't massive, but really very good by Japanese standards and there was enough room for the four of us and our bags without tripping over each other or our bags. There was a nice big bathroom with a bath, and and abundance of high quality toiletries. We were upgraded to an executive room, possibly because I had requested a room with a view of the Rainbow Bridge which was not provided. Instead we were given a room on the Executive Floor, and while we weren't granted the Executive Lounge privileges, the room itself was very nice and it had a complimentary mini bar! We love our booze, and didn't even get through the complimentary mini bar provisions in the three nights we were there (we were of course eating and drinking out however). This was a great hotel - quick, efficient check in, and a very comfortable room. On the first night we realised that I had left my phone on the limousine bus from Narita Airport to Tokyo Terminal Station, and the concierge kindly made calls and helped us make arrangements to retrieve my phone. We used the complimentary shuttle to Disneyland (booked in advance) which was great. The convenience store just downstairs was, well, very convenient. As such, we didn't use any of the restaurants or bars on site. Nor did we seek out the gym, pool etc. In summary, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.

We love Tokyo, and would normally choose to stay closer to the center of the city, but we actually found the location of this hotel to be very convenient as well. And given it costs about half the price of a central Tokyo hotel of a similar standard, it’s well worth considering. It is incredibly easy to get to and from Haneda airport - only 20 mins and 500Y on the Limousine Bus. And if you’re interested in going to Tokyo Disneyland, the hotel has free “Good Neighbor” Shuttle buses there and back. (You need to book both with concierge ahead of time though) The Odaiba area has lots of restaurants and shops to explore, and it is just a short monorail ride across the rainbow bridge to connect with the Yamamote line - which will get you to most other parts of Tokyo. The hotel rooms were very comfortable and had almost a touch of Disney to them. Our only one complaint was that at times we could hear noise from the room adjoining ours. It wasn’t a huge problem, but surprising in a hotel of this quality.

So I was curious to experience its new incarnation. Fortunately, January is the time to visit Odaiba if you are at all budget constrained..Odaiba is basically a warm weather seaside resort favored by families and young people. There are numerous malls, restaurants and even a giant Ferris wheel. But even on a winter's day, if the sun is shining the surroundings are pleasant and sufficiently enjoyable in that it is somewhat removed from urban Tokyo while being only a short distance away. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from a train line that after 15 minutes takes you to Shimbashi station. From there it is simple to catch other trainlines to points throughout Tokyo.It is very conveniently located near Haneda Airport. If you take a limousine bus direct to the hotel it takes all of 20-25 minutes and costs only 520 Yen each way. Though there are only a limited number of such buses a day. Otherwise, if traveling light it is possible to use the monorail and train system with two changes of lines required. However the limousine bus is best if possible, especially if you are burdened with luggage. (Narita is quite a distance away and either a limousine bus - 2800 yen - or the Narita express to Tokyo station and then a train to Shimbashi station and a change to the line going to Odaiba.)This is a very large hotel with some 30 floors and lots of rooms. I was fortunate enough to get a room on the 17th floor with a view of the bay. Like all four and five star Tokyo Hotels service is very good. In the case of the Nikko it is exceptional. It has a very large staff who are more than willing to assist you. English throughout the staff seems uniformly good. (Not sure of course about the maids but everyone else I dealt with had more than satisfactory English.)Rooms are of a good size for a Tokyo hotel with free wifi and about anything else I would want or expect in a very good hotel. I dined with a friend in the hotel's sushi restaurant. The room was very comfortable (with a table side view of the snow falling outside) and the food uniformly excellent. You can manage to eat here without paying exorbitant prices. Given the low price I actually paid for the room, I came out a very clear winner. It has to be one of my more recommended hotels in Tokyo especially if you can land a good deal.","Sydney, Australia","cfreedma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",136,5.0

As we are a family of 4, we ended up taking taxi for some of the shorter trips. It is added cost but saved us a bit of time. Room and service are faultless.

We've stayed in various hotel properties ranging from 3 to 5 stars in both vietnam and several locations in Japan. I didn't think too much about service when staying at a hotel, but Grand Nikko Daiba has shown me why it matters. They are terrible in customer service. Here is what happened, I booked a non-smoking room. When we were checking in, I felt the guy was cold and rushed to give us our room key. I didn't think too much of it, because it is not that big of a deal. But compare this with a 3 star hotel in Sapporo who not only welcomed us, but helped walk our luggage up to our room. Major difference compared to what should be a 4 star hotel??The real problem was when coming back to our room on the 2nd night we smelled smoke. I felt it was strange since usually entire floors our kept non-smoking. So I called the front desk. They didn't give any explanation but only simply says we will bring new room key to you. They proceeded to move us to a new room but provided no explanation of what happened, so I decided to ask the manager (the staff connected me over the phone). He basically told me to prove i booked a non-smoking room by telling me to come down to the front desk.When I did, showing him the e-mail confirmation of a non-smoking room. He proceeded to say no, you booked a smoking room. I wouldn't care if they simply offered apologies or explanation of what really happened, but they wanted to pin all fault on me. And I told him at the end, that you should ask your customers in checking in if they are in a smoking or non-smoking room. (Something all hotels, vietnam and japan did before i checked in. They are the only one who did not confirm!!)AWFUL experience, will never stay in a nikko branded hotel. They do not care about their guests and they treated me with such disrespect.(Also should note that the rooms are outdated and the lights flicker, only saving grace of this hotel is walking distance to a couple malls.

When we called the front desk and spoke to the manager, he demanded us to come to the lobby to show us the confirmation email of our booking as proof that the hotel made an error. We acquiesced and all he said was, ""Smoking-free room means smoking."" He denied that we booked a non-smoking room and dismissed us without any kind of compensation or sincere apology.And if that's not enough to convince you not to book this place (there are many other better hotels in the nearby area), the rooms are sad and dated, the chandeliers in the room flicker because they don't replace the lightbulbs regularly, and there is A QUEUE FOR THE ELEVATORS AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY due to their terrible ratio of elevators to guests in the hotel.

As usual, the number of English TV channels are very limited but being situated in the middle of the Daiba district, there are a lot of entertainment options which will be sufficient for most people on a short stay.There are two issues why I only gave it 4 stars. One is that it is not in Tokyo metro proper so any visits to other main touristy areas will require a train trip (possibly changing trains and stations) and extra traveling time. Keep this in mind and look at the map before you book. The second issue is the extra cost of using the gym and pool (about USD 10 per visit). I understand that it is a very nice facility which is marketed more as a spa but consider how much they are charging for rooms, it seems a little petty to charge paying guests extra for use of gym equipments.There are lots of dining options on-site but they are all quite expensive.

But we did get given some wrong directions at the airport train station which caused a bit of a delay. Not sure the bus would be much quicker, maybe depends on the time of day.The first room we had was great on 11th floor over looking the beach area and Statue of Liberty, awesome view. We had that room for 6 nights, then we had to change as our room was not available for our whole stay. So we moved to room 940. Awful, the room and the whole floor stink, even in the corridors there was this damp, sewerage kind of smell. I am still washing the smell out of the clothes. I don’t know if other levels have this problem but level 11 did not. So this ruined the second half of our stay.The hotel has a very good no cleaning room initiative, you can choose on certain days not to have your room done by house keeping and you receive 1,000 Yen tokens which you can spend at certain shops and restaurants, or donate directly to UNICEF. Very nice toiletries in the rooms. The beds were really hard, so not comfortable at all.We stayed here because the hotel had a pool and it is warm weather. We phoned to make sure I could use it as we had read a review that said no women or children were allowed. The hotel confirmed I could use it a couple 2 days before we arrived, BUT they neglected to tell us it was closed until Summer and did not reopen until the end of July!! We were there at the end of June until 4th of July, I would have thought that was summer, this is not on the website!The gym and pool cost extra so look out for that, if you were a family it would be very expensive. Gym was OK, not great. Pool no idea, closed.There are a lot of nice places to eat amongst the many shopping centres and food courts in Daiba. There is a 24 hour convenience store at the front of the hotel, very reasonable and saved us a few times, especially the night we arrived as it was late and places in the area closed quite early so everything was closed. There is a pretty good coffee shop out the front and a nice bakery & pastry shop, both will take your coupons if you have any, but not at the 24 hour store.I would consider staying again but not on level 9 that is for sure.","Barcelona, Spain","882tanyam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",119,3.0

It's a grand hotel which is obviously aging and needs some serious improvements. It was my second stay for two nights with my grade school aged kids. Flying from LA, riding a bus from Narita, jet lagged, exhausting kids finally fell asleep and then right by my ears from the headboard, first I thought, there came the continuous creaking sound went on and on. It wasn't my next door guests. The very distinct, annoying noise was just like the old wooden door creaking in horror movies.I did search for the past TripAdvisor guest reviews with the similar experiences then found three reviews in Japanese so that proves hotel is aware of the problem. As a former hotel concierge myself I am certain that they keep records of which rooms had clams before. Their intervention for us in the middle of sleepless night when I called was to move my bed from the wall. They said there were no other rooms available on the same floor or they had a room only with two beds! I was paying for three beds for three of us for the stay. Hello??? I even let one employee hear the sound from the wall and he told me the strong wind was the cause. Their excuse was since they can't predict the direction of the wind they can't do much about it. After having two employees over, talking with them right next to my kids trying to fall back to sleep after being awake more than 24 hrs, I had enough for the night. The loud spooky sound kept going throughout the night even after moving bed.Next day the front desk told me on windy days quite a few guests complain about the noise. The least I expect from a hotel is a clean, quiet room so my kids and I can be well rested to enjoy the following day in Japan but that was totally ruined. I took my 15 min filling out the after stay surveys but they haven't said a thing about after almost two weeks. My impression was the management focuses more on Chinese speaking group guests.The interns and room maintenance people working under the questionable management were extremely polite and went above and beyond their assigned work. I very much appreciated their service so two stars are for them.","San Jose, California","Emile K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",34,2.0

The foyer is huge with chandeliers and marble pillars. There are loads of staff on the front desk who bow to you as you enter, your bags are taken up to your room on a trolley. There are boutiques in the foyer, including one selling souvenirs. In other words, it's what you imagine from an old-fashioned posh hotel.The staff on the desk and in the restaurant speak English. The wifi is free and available all over the hotel. The rooms are medium sized (large by European standards, probably not by American standards) and you get a desk, two easy chairs, a small fridge (not stocked), plenty of drawers and a wardrobe with enough hangers for a week-long business trip. You get two bottles of mineral water daily, though the tap water is also drinkable. The bathroom has a full-sized bath, along with a strong shower and a toilet with all the buttons and features (bidet, heated seat...). They provide shampoo and conditioner, and all the toiletries you might have forgotten (toothbrush and paste for example). I forgot a nightshirt and there was one provided, which got replaced with a new one every day! An English-language newspaper was provided daily in front of my door. It is expensive. And I recommend getting a package with breakfast - I had tokens for the buffet, which included freshly cooked omelettes made to order, as well as the core components of a British, American, European, Chinese and Japanese breakfast. My colleagues who did not have the with-breakfast deal found breakfast far too expensive and ended up eating out. It is in a quiet part of town, right next to Daiba station on the monorail (Yurikamome line). It took about an hour to get there by train and monorail (one change) from Narita airport. On my return I took a taxi to Haneda airport-about 25 minutes at 6am. There's a taxi rank outside the hotel, so no booking and waiting. It was easy to walk to my conference venue and the whole area is pedestrianised and open for walking around. There are loads of shopping centres, all with plenty of restaurants for all tastes nearby. I didn't try out the hotel gym, because there were pleasant places to run outside - and that was fine as a woman alone at 6am, I never felt any concern.

The location is excellent, even apart from its amazing view over Tokyo Bay. The Daiba rail station is just steps outside the hotel’s front door as is a convenience store. Several large multistory “malls” are nearby, also a replica of the Statue of Liberty. Airport express buses, for just 520 yen per person, run several times an hour, leaving the hotel with the next stop at Haneda Airport.Our room was rather small but well appointed, with queen bed, desk and chair, two comfortable chairs next to a table and floor lamp, an unstocked mini fridge, safe, small dresser, night stands, closet, good air-conditioner, TV, two phones, free wifi, slippers and Japanese nightshirts, humidifier, and one luggage stand. Electricity is operated by putting the plastic key-card in a slot by the door. There are buttons that turn on outside lights requesting privacy or housekeeping. There are nightlights that illuminate the carpet from under the bedside tables. We got an English-language newspaper each morning in a holder outside our door as well as two free bottles of drinking water daily. There were plenty of outlets, which accommodate American-style plugs and have similar voltages. Our 18th floor room looked out onto an expressway exiting from a tunnel under the bay, parking lots, an industrial waterway, etc. We heard road noise, though faintly.Our bathroom was well designed, with a shower/tub combo, the usual fancy Japanese toilet that ran and squirted whether you wanted it to or not. The bathroom mirror was heated so that it didn't fog up from the moisture of a shower. Service response was very quick (e.g. laundry delivery). The eight main elevators were excellent, extremely quiet, with faint classical music. On each floor, a light immediately came on indicating which elevator would arrive first and whether it was going up or down; it then blinked when it arrived. The hotel has a huge atrium, which includes a wedding venue. The fitness club costs about $10 per day, even for hotel guests, but has an indoor pool with a nice temperature. People with tattoos are not admitted, a peculiar form of Japanese discrimination. When we asked about a room with a view toward the Rainbow Bridge, we were told that we would have to pay 126,000 yen for our six-night stay rather than 89,000...and though the room would be larger, it would have two twin beds rather than the queen bed we desired. So we declined. Our rate did not include the 3,300 per-person charge for breakfast. Most guests had breakfast coupons, presumably via deals that included breakfast with the room charge. Given the amazing view from the 30th floor restaurant and abundant variety of western and Japanese breakfast items, the charge was not unreasonable, and the room charge (booked via TripAdvisor) was also reasonable, though somewhat more expensive than other nearby hotels.We recommend the expensive breakfasts on the 30th floor that opens at 6:30 a.m., though there are other options that open later. On some mornings, the restaurant was largely empty; but on others, a long queue had formed before opening and still later arrivees had to give their names and return later. The most desirable tables, facing the Rainbow Bridge, are mostly for two people only; these provide what must be the best, premium view in the entire city of Tokyo. We tried the Japanese and Chinese restaurants in the hotel; they provided good, attractive meals with good service, but were expensive.Our international conference, in a nearby science museum, held its “banquet” in a splendid underground ballroom of this hotel. The food served buffet style was soon gone; many interpreted it to be an appetizer course, but it was actually the entire meal. Some people had nothing to eat other than dessert (and beer), despite paying about $130. Whether this was a failure of the hotel or of our conference organizers, or perhaps a cultural mismatch in what to expect and how much to eat from a dinner buffet, we do not know.On our final morning, we requested a noon check-out instead of the posted hour of 10 a.m. The front-desk clerk said that it would cost 4000 yen! We explained that we had never heard of charging for a late check-out unless it extended well into the afternoon. He was obstinate. We asked to speak to a manager and he told us to stand in the lobby by the suitcases, which we refused to do. No manager ever came. After about 15 minutes, the clerk finally said, “OK, you can depart at noon with no charge, but just this one time.” We recommend this hotel, but beware of unexpected high prices, like the 4000 yen extra charge to extend your stay just until noon, or the appetizer plate of caviar that costs about $300.","Nederland, Colorado","nedtraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nederland, Colorado</strong>",286,5.0

Location:Location - if you are American, I'm not sure why you would want to stay in this area because everything is American, ranging from Red Lobster to ToysRUs. There's even a Statue of Liberty in the bay out front. Just not my scene. I guess it's fine and desirable for people with kids.Dining options were very limited in my opinion, unless you want to spend several hundred dollars. The only decent Japanese option that we enjoyed was Gonpachi in the huge mall next door. (This is a copy of the main restaurant in Roppongi, where Quinton Tarantino's Kill Bill had a famous scene.) On the positive side, it is very conveniently located adjacent to a new private train. Expensive compared to other local trains and no combo or day use options. Costs $7 round trip to Shimbashi station (then you need to buy new tickets to wherever). Taxi from Narita is $200. No joke. That's what we paid. (Try the limousine bus, if that's available.)If you're coming for business, not doing much sightseeing in the main Tokyo areas, then this hotel is fine, and a lot closer to Haneda. Brunch:Brunch had a wait. Yes, it's a buffet and you had to wait to get seated. And the food was poor quality. Though, I was not impressed with much of the breakfast in any hotel in Japan so perhaps it's just me. But the runny scrambled eggs and the overcooked rubbery hard sunny side up were horrible - and that was the best of all the options. It was so bad, I had to take a picture. See below. Thankfully they had fresh fruit and yogurt. Even the minimal pastriespastries were boring and dry. Omelette station looked nice, but I'm not into omelettes. Toilet:Disappointing toilet. Outdated by Japanese standards. This is a fancy hotel, and I expect the toilets to measure up. Here, even on the executive level our toilet was just the added bidet seat thing. It wasn't even a mid-range. It was low end. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it sounds like I'm a complete snob, but after you spend some time in Japan, you will notice the difference. We stayed in a very small ryokan in the middle of nowhere and the toilet had automatic sensors that lifted/shut the lids, heated seats, and even air dried your butt! This toilet had 1/5 the features. Positives: lovely room on the executive floor with nice views. Very clean and comfortable. Excellent shower and water pressure and large bathtub.

Because we took an afternoon flight and arrived late at Haneda Airport, we decided to stay at Daiba for two nights before going to Tokyo Disneyland. We compared the two well-known hotels in Daiba and found Grand Nikko offered a better rate for late check-in guests which fitted our schedule. When we arrived at the Haneda Airport, it was already passed 11pm. So we took a taxi from the airport straight to the Hotel. It was a short journey and only took about 15 minutes but costed about Yen 5000. Anyway, it was pretty convenient and fast by taxi. The hotel is pretty grand and the front desk staff was polite but not warm. There was no one at the front door to help us with the luggage. Still there was no line at all at the check-in. So we could get our room key pretty soon. The room is spacious, clean and nice. We could overlooked the Daiba area but not much of the view, because we did not pay for a room with view. So it was understandable. The house cleaning did a good job to clean room pretty well every day. One good thing about the hotel is that it is connected to the Mono Rail station (Yurikamome). It is just about 2 minutes walk from the hotel lobby to the Mono Rail station and the Mono Rail can take you around the Daiba area or connect you to other Tokyo subway. So the location is very convenient. It takes only about 30 minutes from Daiba to Shinjuku or 10 minutes from Daiba to Tsukiji (the fish market).

Had a room with two twin (double?) beds. I don't think we paid for a nice view but got one anyways. At check-in they noticed we were celebrating a birthday and gave us a nice present. The room size is very generous when compared to the rest of Tokyo. I spent hours comparing room sizes and this hotel has about double the square meters of floor room when compared to other hotels. Found a very good price on booking dot com. Only 20-30 bucks more a night to stay here versus a business type hotel with small rooms. Didn't try the breakfast, so cant rate it. I heard many staff members speak English, so don't think that's a problem. Only negatives (which could be seen as normal/acceptable by others), were the amount of staff. Huge number of staff always in the lobby. Kinda feels weird with many eyes watching you as you walk in and out. However, they are there to help you if needed. Other negative, they help you with your luggage, and escort you to your room. This seemed to be the case with everyone. They take your luggage and give you a luggage tag, which I assumed meant that I would get it after check-in to take to my room. Nope. It was all loaded on a cart with someone ready to take me to my room. Great person, no complaints. Just an awkward what seemed like waiting for a tip at the end. Maybe they are used to getting tips from foreign guests, but having lived in Japan for many years I have never ever tipped for anything.

Go for the one day pass on the Yurikamome train (unlimited for 820 yen)Grand Nikko is a grandeur hotel typical of a 5 star establishment with a grand wedding stage in metal staircase deck (almost 20 m high) depicting ""Titanic"" It has great service, great F&B and super clean.There are Seagfredo Coffee, rustic cafes, bakeries and a 24 hour convenience shop that takes care of almost all your needs just a stone throw around the hotel compound.The entertainment complex is Daiba is a full day or two of family fun.Shopping at Aqua City and Diver City has all the major brands for mid market covering H&M, Uniglo, Adidas and lots of food from fast food, coffees joints and all kinds of shop including a Gundam Cafe.At the night the view is stupendous of a New York scene with the office Tower lining up the opposite side of Tokyo and the Rainbow Bridge lighted up in Rainbow colours.The bridge does look like Brooklyn Bridge.Good to take walks on both sides of the broadway facing Diver Mall and the Decks Tokyo beach side.Word of caution, winds can reach great heights but the feeling is GREATOther very great sights are - Fuji TV Station - Panasonic Centre (Technology showcase for latest home electronic and entertainment)- Mega Web (Technology showcase for car and accessories)- Museum of Science (Miraikan) showcasing latest in Robotics- Daikanratha - the largest Ferris wheel in the world in 1999 @ 115 metre but with all the London Eye and other global city eyes this is a bit outdated.- Museum of Maritime Science- A huge GUNDAM Robot at the front of Diver CityThis is surely another place to explore in Tokyo and accessibility is also great.For travel in Tokyo unless you are quite sure of your destinations it is best to skip all the passes and go for a prepaid card. There are 2 such cards and I opt for the Suica preloaded and you can use any of the transportation in Tokyo including some cafes and shops.This is quite important as you do not want to keep buying tickets as Tokyo is super fast pace with people rushing from all corners to all corners.Peak time travelling (going to work and after work) can be quite an experience so get the card and just scan in and scan out like the Tokyolites. Go to Shibuya crossing - human merging into 5 zebra crossing to cross the street.Mind you that itself is a tourist attraction with Loccitane shop going into cafe business to have the view of ""Shibuya Crossing""The best and cheaper option is of course ""Starbucks"" view - ""AWESOME""","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","keett712</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",93,4.0

Many people think Daiba (Tokyo Bay) is out of the way from Tokyo and it is generally speaking as compared to Ginza or Shibuya. However, if you have children or want bigger rooms at better price and a place to walk in nature i.e. by the water in the bay or want value for your money, then the Grand Nikko is the hotel for you. The service is exceptional and if you are North American, remember that tipping is actually impolite in Japan, so enjoy the service and don't tip (there is something freeing about not having to tip everyone that takes your bags, answer questions, room service etc.). The metro ride (separate payment) in Shimbashi Station in Tokyo is something straight out of the movies--automatic train (no drives or conductors) and through futuristic buildings. Just amazing.The rooms are very big and luxurious. 2 medium size shopping malls are close by.If you are a tourist and taking the trains, you may find the 600yen day pass to be the greatest value, even better than IC cars, though IC cards allow you the freedom to travel about. Oh and the gym, while a $10 supplement is well worth the experience and allows you to take a free yoga class, swim in warm 20 yard swimming pool, jazuzzi, sauna's, baths etc. Well worth the experience to wind down or begin the day--just loved it.

I am allergic to feathers so a housekeeper came to the room, stripped the bed and totally remade it with non-allergic materials. There was a festival on the grounds adjacent to the hotel. The soundproofing of the rooms was excellent, even muted a 9pm (exactly) fireworks display that cascaded right outside our 20th floor accommodation. The room rate included a buffet breakfast on the top of the hotel (don't forget to take your camera). We found the restaurants a little pricy but the TWO shopping centres that are almost connected to the hotel housed a multitude of restaurants from food fairs to some amazing eateries. A great property I would use again.","Bowen Island, Canada","Murray A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bowen Island, Canada</strong>",70,5.0

The room was large, had a nice view, and nicely appointed. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. I was happy that the air conditioning worked great as I like a cool room when sleeping. The hotel was large and several restaurants. We purchased a breakfast option with our room. There are two locations for breakfast. We dined on the 30th floor and there was a nice offering for breakfast. The view from that level was great. Before arriving, I thought the hotel might be located too far from sights in Tokyo, but I found that it was easy to get around and not far to get where we wanted to go. The train or monorail line is 3 minutes from the hotel door with no streets to cross. The area the hotel appears new and elevated above street level, so it is easy walking. The train is 15 minutes to one of the larger stations (Shimbashi) in Tokyo, and from that station you can just about go anywhere. Getting there from Narita on our day of arrival was easier than I expected too. Using the Japan Rail pass, we took the Narita Express train to the Tokyo station, onto the Yamanote line to Shimbashi (still using the JR pass) and then on the Yurikamome line, which is the train or monorail to Daiba. The was a fee for this train.I would stay again at this hotel and recommend it. After staying there, I think I preferred not having the noise of the city or a view of another building just outside the window.The hotel also caters to guests wanting to go to Disneyland, so it can get busy, but it was never a bother to me.","Bath, Maine","mdchuck</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bath, Maine</strong>",19,5.0

Cold & blustery when we were there but well worth the effort to walk the 300m from the cable station to the highest point of the ice wall.

The Grand Pacific hotel rivals any 5star hotel anywhere and is conveniently located beside a monorail station that takes you to the heart of traditional Tokyo in 20mins. ODaiba is a shopping & family entertainment paradise and there is a free shuttle bus that takes you to all the key tourist and shopping centers.

It is like its own city.It is on Daiba, an island just across the river from Tokyo in the Tokyo Bay area.What I liked:1. rooms are clean and spacious2. bathroom had really nice rose petal sea salts3. free wifi4. ample room to hang clothes and do work5. delicious breakfast - primairly continental with some Japanese offerings- view on the 26th? floor of the entire city...but, breakfast on the second floor has more tea and other food options. The purple sweet potato danish was phenomenal. 6. quick service (only waited 5 to 10 minutes for a towel, shower cap...)7. helpful service (the front desk were helpful in giving directions)8. location - connected to the Yurikamome metro, which is an independent system9. free shuttle (up to 8:00 pm) for shopping at Venus Forte and other shopping malls10. ingredients in the food are identified with symbols, such as a hen for chicken, a cow for beef, shrimp...great for someone with allergies11. foreign currency exchange machine12 computers with internet access in the lobby (to print boarding passes, etc.)13. about 2-3 corner stores (good places to get a quick bite and souvenirs)14. shopping - some boutiques have unique accessories, but are overpriced15. views - there are excellent views of the island throughout this hotel, especially on the 26th floor.16. complementary water bottles and newspaper provided daily (I stayed for 3 days)17. fridge in room with mini bar18. rooms seem quiet even though I was close to the elevators...I don't recall hearing any noise19. location - Daiba is a beatufiul island- you could easily spend a day or two on the island alone. It reminds me of Las Vegas.What I did not like:1. the TV: No English channels apart from a dubbed over CNN and an NHK channel which only brought Asian news and Japan tourism ideas2. the water is hot...really hot...scalding. Make sure you test the water before taking your shower. I tried to soak my feet and had to wait 20 minutes before the water got to a ""just hot"" level.3. dinner buffet in the second-floor restaurant...this was just like any standard buffet. The sesame balls and the pork were the only standouts. The desserts were awful. Also, the buffet ran out of food very quickly and it took some 15 to 20 minutes to replace it. Since my food options are limited due to allergies, this was a nuissance. 4. distance to Tokyo - Daiba is a beautiful island and there is much to do there, but since it is off-island, it takes about 45 minutes to get into the Shibuya district as well as another metro fare. Day passes for both systems cost about $20 to $22 USD. The trip into Tokyo wastes 1.25 to 1.5 hours of your day.5. it is about 1.5 to 2 hours away from Narita airport. I beleive that there are shuttles that leave from the hotel. Plan accordingly.6. Communal body soap and shampoos - there is a caddy in your bathtub with soaps and shampoos. There are no bars of soap offered. I find this to be unsanitary, but is seems to be common in Japan (same thing at a hotel in Kyoto, but not in Osaka).","Montreal, Canada","travelandshop2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",123,4.0

The hotel have got direct transport (15 minutes trip) from Haneda Airport 2~3 times every hour, transport to Narita 2~3 times a day at a nominal fee & is also a Disney friendly hotel (in other words, they provide free transport to & fro Disneyland/DisneySea). Breakfast have a choice of 3 location, Continental at the lobby or the top level, and a Japanese-type in B1. Breakfast at the top floor provides a fantastic panoramic view of the bay area & would sure to increase your appetite. If you are staying for more than a couple of days, like us, and getting sick of the daily breakfast, you can choose to use the breakfast vouchers in exchange for lunch/dinner, topping up the extra in cost.Rooms are Spacious with a capital ""S"", we have gotten an upgrade to a deluxe room, for 4 days or more of occupancy, our rooms were facing river & overlook one of the 3 underground tunnels coming into the bay area, toiletries are all Sheiseido brand topped up daily.A train station was located right beside the hotel, connecting major shopping center like Diver's City & Aqua-xxxx. Shopping & food galore The hotel is also within walking distance to several ferry/cruise pickup/drop-off points that have cruise/ferry that our family took from Sumeida (near the Asakusa area) back to our hotel. a view from the river cruise is one of those that visitors must not miss, it provides a different perspective from the hassle & bustle of Tokyo city life.My only complaint was the only single train line that service the Odaiba area, though it's a loop route that service most of the shopping & tourist spots (Palette City) of the bay area, access to city must be transit via Shimbashi. And if your travel itinerary covers all shopping area within the city area, it is more advisable to find a hotel located along the Yamanote line.Overall, excellent hotel with services & facilities exceeding expectation.",Singapore,"happytripper70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",12,5.0

Tokyo proper is a short monorail trip away.As with all hotels in Japan there were staff aplenty, all ready to bow at passing guests. They do this managing to give the impression they genuinely appreciate one's custom. We eat breakfast a few times - buffet with the inevitable omelette chef, Western, Chinese and Japanese foods, all on the 30th floor with even more serious views. We also tried their buffet on the lobby level, which we were less keen on. Not a great selection, no sneeze guards and inflated drink prices (950 Y for a glass of 'white wine') even for many star Japanese hotels. The lobby bar is smoking - literally.

After checking-in around midnight, I recognized this was the worst choice in my entire life to celebrate a special moment. Totally the opposite side of all the great reviews- so tiny and very outdated room (e.g., paints-off here and there) with the construction view and loud highway car noise from windows. Even worse, no other room available after midnight.The front desk staff (when checking in after midnight) was also very rude in an extremely POOR English when I asked an additional room key, and more mineral water since my boy was sick. After waiting another 5 minutes, the staff sternly replied back to me... There was no way for me to get water for my boy to my room in this hotel after midnight. The only thing I liked about this hotel was its location and breakfast. The ladies in the lobby were kind and helpful too. I very much regret not selecting Hilton with even lower room rates.

This is a separate line and you have to pay separately. Consider this part of the price of the hotel. You can't get this low price in the center of Tokyo. The tennis players also stayed in the hotel and I knew some of them (WTA). There is a great place to eat ""Aqua-Mall"" which is connected to the hotel.

The room was cozy with pretty big bathtub to unwind after all the work or shopping you have done before the stay. TV was big and all amenities were pretty decent. The weird thing about this hotel is how the entrance is located if you take the Yurikamome Train. You will get off the train and squeeze yourself in to a small corridor which definitely seems to be the back entrance of the hotel. For a hotel like this, they should still have a better looking back entrance. Location wise though, this place is awesome if you want to explore everything in Odaiba. Most of the malls and attractions are within walking distance. One thing I like about Odaiba is the fact that they have a very very big Starbucks inside Aquacity if I remember correct.

The hotel is a bit pricey for what it is and could be more of a 4.5 stars hotel rather than 5 as it lacked a few finer touches. Our room for 4 could have used a few extra square feet to make it just a little more spacious especially for larger families that usually carry a bit of extra luggage. We had a room with 4 small double beds. Overall, it was a pleasant hotel with nice staff and I wouldn't mind staying there again.Our room itself was nice especially the bathroom and the other amenities. The bathroom was quite large in comparison to the room itself. Loved the toilet seats in Japan. I had never used a bidet and after getting over the initial oddity of it, it was rather nice. Nothing like sitting on a warm seat in the middle of the night ! Because we were usually out during the day and evenings in town sightseeing, we never tried the hotel restaurants but looking at the menus, they seem rather pricey. The hotel was well set up for weddings and banquets and I suspect in Tokyo, it's pretty prestigious to hold your wedding and banquet at the Grand Pacifica. As you walk out towards the train station, there is a convenience store where we often bought breakfast foods, snacks and some souvenirs. There are also a lot of restaurants in the malls and they range in price and types of cuisine. Most of the food catered to the tourist market though so don't expect to find too much traditional everyday family style Japanese food.In terms of location, the good points are that it is close to several large shopping malls in Daiba. A couple of these malls were rather on the cheap end of the scale which was surprising to us. The stores sold mostly cheap merchandise and some oddities. I am talking about AquaCity and Decks. For a more conventional North American type mall and better merchandising, you need to go to Diver City. All the malls are within a short walking distance over the viaducts which you access directly from the hotel exits so very conveniently located in that sense. Also, all the malls have their food courts and restaurants. In AquaCity, there are several floors of more conventional restaurants whereas at Diver City, there is a fabulous open food court on the first floor.In terms of location relative to sightseeing around Tokyo however, we found with a family, it wasn't as convenient as we first thought. To get into the city centre where the attractions are, you need to take 2 separate train/subway systems with a substantial walk between the stations. This added a lot to the commuting time along with additional costs and at the end of some afternoons after a lot of walking and sightseeing already, if you go back to the hotel to rest up, you are less apt to go out again for the evening just because it is a bit too much. This is especially the case if you have been sightseeing for most of the day over several days and have young children. Add to this the heat on a hot July and August afternoon and well, you get the picture. It takes about 20-25 minutes to get to the Shimbashi station on the Tokyo metro system and from Shimbashi, you can get anywhere you need within Tokyo. You can also choose to go to the Toyosu station on the opposite side of the line but that is a longer commute but you do get to see the city a little more as it is an above ground rail system. If I were to stay in Tokyo again, I might try to find a hotel more centrally located next to any metro station in the heart of the city. One note in regards to the staff. I have to say a special thanks to Ms. Yamaguchi who looked after our luggage for us. As we were carrying a lot of luggage, we wanted to send a few of our suitcases ahead to our next destination rather than lugging them all onto the Shinkasen. Ms. Yamaguchi who was working at the luggage concierge desk was very helpful in getting things set up for us. Overall, I enjoyed our stay at the Grand Pacifica. The hotel is clean, well designed and the staff helpful. Rooms are nice and well kept with a very nice bathroom and high quality toiletries. My only issues were the extra commute to get into the city attractions but then again, the Daiba train station to get started on your trek is very conveniently located just outside the side doors of the hotel.One last note of caution though. For families traveling with young children, there are age restrictions for the swimming pool and my kids were very disappointed when we learned they could not use the pool.",Vancouver,"Joseph H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver</strong>",33,4.0

It is very easy to access - a shuttle service is available to Haneda at appointed times. Around the hotel there are new shopping malls and lots of eateries which are just a walk on an overhead bridge away. It is near the colourful rainbow bridge which is prettily lit up at night.

And after a day at Disneyland we just wanted a simple supper and go to bed but the buffet-style restaurant was already full and so we couldn't eat there.

My complaints are mainly on the location, in the area of odaiba itself there is little to do and there are few worthwhile places to eat. The areas of Ginza, Chuo and Shibuya where a lot of the interesting things take place are frustratingly as long as an hour away via public transport. On the other hand the public transport is excellent in Tokyo and generally fairly cheap so the travel is bearable.My other complaints are much smaller. The hotel pool costs ¥3600 yen per PERSON to use which is a shame really as this is really too much and annoying in a world where I have come to expect pools included.The hotel is huge and crowded and this leads to some annoyance when there are longish queues for breakfast although these are rarely more than 10 minutes.This hotel provides NO SOYA MILK and for a lactose intolerant person like myself this is somewhat frustrating.

We are suite room customers with club lounge access but still they said they can't give more than 2bottles/room event though we can go to lounge to drink as much as we want. It's quite strange. Not very good for their branding though.In other 5hotels that we use in Japan, only this hotel limit 2mineral bottle/room.Breakfast choice also limited and hotel facility is ok.Since its location in Odaiba, we rely on yurikamome or rinkai line or shuttle bus to Shinagawa to connect with Tokyo downtown / Tokyo mainland. It needs around 35-45min so it's a min point stay in OdaibaBut if you want to shopping / duty free, there are at least 4-5 next door mall linked with pedestrian to the hotel.

It's strongly recommend to check out its Japanese website for various staying plans if you could read Japanese, because you cannot find them in English or Chinese versions. There are plenty of packages including breakfast, dinner, tours, that could be combined with different room types and staying periods. You can even choose a cheap plan to check in late and check out early.The hotel provides free shuttle services to facilitate you wonder around the neighbourhood or to/from Disney land/see park. But you have to book the Disney neighbour bus in advance from its official website.As the other reviewer stated, the room was very clean and comfy and the services were with high standard. The only complaint I would say was the breakfast. There are three restaurants that you could choose for the breakfast: the one on the top floor with great views, the one in the lobby, and the Japanese style restaurant on the third floor. I would not recommend to take the set dish from the Japanese one, because most of the set dish food you could also eat from the buffet restaurants. The buffet restaurant on the top floor has an amazing view from the harbour but it's also crowded. The one in the lobby has same type of food but with less people. There were few vegetables and fruits in the buffet which is similar as the other Japan hotels. Though the types of cooked dishes (meat, soup, eggs, breads, etc.) were not as sufficient as the other 4-5 star hotels.All in all, this is one of the best standard hotels in Daiba area.","Beijing, China","Zangwill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",37,4.0

This hotel is located across from Nikko Tokyo Hotel and it is accessible by Yurikamome Line which is located just outside the hotel. This hotel is also basically right across from Aqua City Shopping Mall which is located in the same side as Nikko Tokyo Hotel.Both of me and my friend arrived in the hotel property slightly before midnight in a rainy evening. The hotel lobby was grand. Check-in was average (a bit slow) as it took the receptionist staff more than 10 minutes to hand over the room keys. Within 15 minutes of our arrival, we entered our room.Our room's size was average but it's considered as large in Japan's hotel. Bathroom was nicely designed but pitifully, I saw many of their furniture in the room as well as carpets (inside the room and in public areas) were not in good condition. I also saw many of their limestone had black stains on them. Yes, I did understand that this hotel was built many years ago and apparently, it also catered heavily to group tours from overseas.In my personal opinion, it's about time for this particular hotel to proceed with room renovation. Otherwise, the hotel may start losing its appeal to their loyal guests who are looking for quality accommodation in the next few years. I don't provide a 4 stars' rating for this hotel due to condition I had described above.If I were stay in this particular hotel 5-10 years ago then most likely, I would give a 4 stars' rating. However, this hotel is strategically located in Odaiba area, in the middle of many interesting spots in Tokyo so that such fact certainly gives an advantage over other competitor hotels in Tokyo.We didn't have any chance to try their breakfast as we woke up late the next day but I personally believe they were capable to serve quality dining in one of their dining outlets. Also, there is a bus just outside the hotel's main entrance that will take us to Shinagawa train station for a small fee.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to every one who is looking for good quality accommodation, based on the condition I had described, in Odaiba area as long as they don't mind paying their nightly rate.","Semarang, Indonesia","Bambang S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Semarang, Indonesia</strong>",297,3.0

The room was spacious, the view amazing (Rainbow bridge side), the bed comfy, and the area is a delight to explore, especially in the evening. Breakfast was great, with 3 options. We chose the buffet on the 30th floor, and while they do cater for a Western style, you have to appreciate the wide range of patrons they have there and are trying to appease all. The chef will cook an omelet if you want, but overall a high standard. The staff we dealt with all had a good understanding of english and were very courteous.

On a trip filled with wonderful experiences and exceptional memories, Grand Pacific really was a high note to end it on. Directly connected to Daiba station, the hotel is a breeze to get to from the Yurikamome line (which can be taken to Shiodome/Shimbashi for connections across Tokyo). All of the public areas are astonishing - high, vaulted ceilings, wide open lobbies, antique-style furniture and chandeliers remind you more of an ultra-luxe European hotel than one found in Japan. But the spaces still feel clean, bright and modern. There are an abundance of elevators which are again very swanky. Our twin room was stunning - so much space, which really is a rarity in Japan - with huge, comfortable beds and wonderful views across the river and the Rainbow Bridge. Double doors lead into the huge bathroom, which had dual vanity sinks, a walk-in shower and a bathtub. There's a lot of storage space in the wardrobe, too. Staff were very professional, friendly and efficient. They helped us organise taxis and transfers, answered our transport questions, and assisted us with our luggage we had delivered to the hotel via takuhaibin service (worth looking into if you're travelling around). The hotel offers free transfer services to the Disney parks, and is a short walk to Aqua City and Diver City shopping malls and the other attractions nearby. One thing I would say is that when the malls close (about 10:30pm) there isn't a great deal to do in the area, with few bars or restaurants to end the night in. There is, however, a 24-hour convenience store right in front of the hotel to pick up snacks and drinks.

Purists may somehow complain on level of the command of English of some of them, but we all are foreigners in some places and should show some understanding. Speaking slowly and some empation breaks all the barriers. As for the location, everybody knows Odaiba is not Tokyo's downtown. As an artificial island it is considered tourist attraction itself. We reached the hotel from Narita by Taxi (prearranged) paying 19500yen. Last Hotel bus left half an hour earlier, otherwise we would use it (2800yen p.p). We took the bus on the way and it was flawless - even a little cosmical with multilevel tags for the bags, multiple checkups by the staff and Japanese style bowing. High class safe way to reach the airport. As for commuting to the downtown, you should use Warerfront line. Ticket is 360yen - twice the usual Underground. View is scenic - especially passing the Pearl Bridge. Having some luck you may even take the pilot seat :)As for the breakfast - definitely use 30th floor restaurant - cost 2800yen. Take the window seat and enjoy the view. Food is really tasty and you may risk having two breakfasts at once - European and Japanese. On you own belly fat risk ;)Rooms are very clean and well furnished. I cannot agree with some reviewers finding them obsolete and worn out. With my wide experience I find them classy and in a very good taste. Shiseido cosmetics in the bathroom is only a partial proof. To cut some costs you may shop for groceries and beverages in the little 24/7 store just in front of the Waterfront Train doors. Wines and spirits there are real bargain. You can get acceptable Chilean Sauvgnon Blanc around 1000yen. If you like shopping - you have few huge Malls in the walking distance. Internet is included and works very well.

We'd read the positive reviews T.A. beforehand but hadn't expected such opulence. Our double/double room on the 18th floor was probably as good as any we've ever stayed in. Despite overlooking a busy dual carriageway traffic noise wasn't a problem. The air con was very responsive and the free wifi worked well. The nicely appointed bathroom was crammed with all manner of toiletries, plus a toilet with a heated seat and several other features we didn't risk using. Hot water was constant and plentiful and the shower pressure was good. There was also a fridge (but no mini bar, thankfully) and a kettle and tea tray. As breakfast was a fairly ridiculous (but pretty standard) £18 each we chose to either eat at one of the nearby shopping malls or create our own - there is a shop within the hotel precincts that sells pastries, etc., plus a 24 hour convenience store mere yards away. The staff were uniformly polite and helpful (isn't everyone in Japan?) but, as noted by some other reviewers, quite a few had limited English. However, all of them had better English than my non existent Japanese. We really didn't have time to experience the other facilities at the hotel, including an outdoor pool, but I did hear from another guest that use of the gym would incur an extra charge. Strange if true. The hotel is not near to the centre of Tokyo but the monorail final station takes you pretty close - maybe a mile from there to the middle of the Ginza district.

Our room on the 12th floor which In assume was standard was excellent 2 large beds a bathroom full of amenities with marble effect décor and the water pressure something to experience, the shower nearly knocked me off my feet. The view over the water was stunning and we watched our cruise ship leave for the next port of call. Everybody in the hotel was very attentive but their Engish was a bit basic. There is a fitness centre with a large swimming pool. Its quite easy to access Tokyo centre via the rail system. The hotel has a definite 5 star feel about it. In the evening its nice to see Tokyo lit up and the various buildings nearby. I think its the Fujitsu building that lights up to music.Some friends stayed in Ginza and found the area very expensive so recommend this hotel.","Hartlepool, United Kingdom","GS2013_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hartlepool, United Kingdom</strong>",76,5.0

Whilst it is all the above, I want to list all the pros and cons so you can decide for yourself:Pros:- price is less than half of what you'd pay in Tokyo but for a much bigger room.- Hotel is impressive and service is very courteous - Rooms are spacious (not the norm for Japan) and comfortable. I loved the spacious bathroom and generous bath amenities - from Haneda Airport, it is much cheaper to commute to this place but not from Narita (¥590 vs ¥2800 bus)- location within Odaiba is very central with malls such as Diver City, Toyota museum, and parks within walking distance. The subway is also right next to it. - Odaiba is definitely worthwhile to devote a day or so exploring around here. There are even marked running routes. - 24 hour convenience store at the hotel's footstep- New looking town: clean with wide open spaces outside the hotel vicinity. There are even marked running routes. Cons:- I can't stand goose down pillows. By the middle of the night I was awake trying to plump it up (useless). The next day we were able to request for hard pillows - expect a 30-50 minute commute that involves at least one transfer via trains and bus to get out of Odaiba into Tokyo and other cities. So once you're out, you are out for the day.Overall if I plan to travel to Japan with family and a relaxed pace, I would return.","Luzon, Philippines","KimberlyGM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luzon, Philippines</strong>",205,5.0

Hotel takes some effort to get to by public transport, but it's worth it in my opinion. (For those concerned, the hotel has shuttle services to the airports, and a line of taxis) Hotel complex itself has a distinctive European romantic feel to it, all the marble, European motifs, piped music etc. Rooms are spacious and clean, packed with all sorts of amenities. And of course there's the view. I believe every room should have some view of Tokyo Bay to an extent. Mine, the second room on the corridor, faced the industrial (Tennozu) area. But Rainbow Bridge was still mostly visible on the fringe.No shortage of fun in the surrounding area. Walking distance to almost all the shopping complexes of Odaiba. One minute to the photo-spot for the bridge and the liberty statue. And just two stations (5 mins) to Oedo Onsen. Was really great returning to my room after a long evening at Odaiba, and gazing at the nightlights before going to sleep.

It was a nice hotel that nearly adjoined to the railway with many good features. We booked the rainbow bridge view room. We were allocated a room that was likely the "" lowest level"" for this room as we could ' see the bridge' but the nikko hotel was the main feature of our view. The room itself was nicely appointed and spacious by Japanese standards, the bed was comfortable and the room clean. The highlight was the lovely bathroom that had heated toilet seats, ( I wish we had these in Australia), a good sized bath and the daily ( high quality) facial products provided. The other bonus was the 24 hour convenience store that had provisions for late night munches ( and alcoholic beverages as well).We were lucky to get a good deal on the room by booking in advance had a breakfast included in the package. Whilst the breakfast had a nice selection I was very disappointed about the wait. I had read that at peak times hour you may need to wait a while to get seated but this happened for us Everyday! Two of those occasions were before 7 am!We tried all three restaurants ( there seemed no delay at the traditional Japanese breakfast- but by choosing to eat here so we could get seated sooner meant that we had to pay 500 yen each for a cup coffee ( that seemed a bit over the top to me given it should be an inclusive package. If you have lazy days planned waiting around breakfast around might suit you, but we had action filled days that made this a disappointment for me.I was we'll aware the diaba station was a little out of the city and made the decision to sacrifice location for quality, however this travel did get tedious. Once you were back at the hotel to get changed after a long say of sightseeing it seemed ' too hard"" to go back into the city for dinner. Of note the metropolitan japanese train lines have more than one type of ticket, ( we had to use three types to get around the city each day) if you want to be able to come and go as much as you like this can add up in time and money.

Convenient access to Disney parks with 30 minutes travelling time by Disney bus.Sheltered walkway to Daiba train station.Plenty of attractions (nearby onsen, museums, eating and shopping places including a factory outlet).ConsTo get to downtown Tokyo (Shinjuku, Ginza etc) you need to shuttle out of Daiba on the Yurikamome line (JPY320 one way adult) to Shimbashi and change line and pay another fare. Alternatively, you have to walk to Tokyo Teleport and then take Rinkai line (about JPY500 to Shinjuku one way).Timings of the departure of the Disney buses from Disney should be aligned to the Disney fireworks timings as the fireworks display start at 8.30pm but the buses depart for the hotel at those times unless you book the last bus back to the hotel which leaves after 10 pm OverallA pleasant stay.TipsFor better value and if you have a fair amount to buy, go to the local supermarket Marueto (next to the Odaiba kaihinkoen station) For Grand Pacific, it is highly recommended that you make online reservations for the Disney buses via the hotel website especially during peak periods as there are limited seats on the bus as soon as possible. I was fortunate that I did so at least one month before I arrived as the Disney buses were full when I arrived.To enjoy the sights, you should take the Yurikamome line train once in the day and once at night and make sure you're in the front seat of the driverless trainPuzzled or lost as to how to get out of or back into a train station ?

They were too soft... even if you use the two pillows, you will still feel as if there were none at all.One of the staff (a slim lady) in the Concierge was very helpful on the tours that we could take on the next coming days. Since city tour is full already and we were after the cherry blossoms, she recommended that we go to Asakusa and Ueno. She got a brochure, a map and 3 or 4 colored pens and started explaining to us (using the pens) the train and the water bus routes to Asakusa. The location of the hotel is very right for shopping, since Diver City, Aqua City, Palette Town and Decks are very near to each other.

I'd say, overall, our stay is one of the best and this hotel is highly recommendable!","Quezon City, Philippines","Annie R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Quezon City, Philippines</strong>",9,5.0

I think it has at least 7-8 restaurants but personally did not try any of them. The room has great view at the bridge and spectacular during the night when lights are on. Can actually see the tokyo tower from here. It has free shuttle to Disneyland. But you have book early because usually it's full. They also have shuttle bus around the area bringing you tokyo tv station, divers city etc. During the night, you can go downstairs and walk along the area to appreciate the views and there is musical light dancing at Tokyo tv station. If you walk to divers city, you can find a giant gundam robot near the entrance and there will be shows for the famous robot. During the shows on the big screen, the robot can actually move! There is also a 24hrs convenient store just below the hotel. Try order the curry ramen from room service. It's nice. Daiba train station just next to the hotel. You can take this train to just anywhere in tokyo including shibuya, shinjuku etc. Of course you need to change to other trains at the interchange. It's not difficult to travel around Tokyo as there are English words train route in almost every station. And most employees in the station speaks English. Overall a great place to stay.

Breakfast was served on either 2nd, 3rd or 30th floor with great views of the Bay area from the 30th floor. Although they were so busy I had to wait 10 mins before being seated for my breakfast. Good choice of both western and eastern food. Disney free shuttle bus needed to be booked before hand and was almost full due to them being super busy. Departure times vary, they have different options for departure and returning. The ride there was 35 mins in a tiny bit of traffic. There is a family mart store just outside the hotel and the train station is right there on your doorstep. Some large shopping malls are all around that area within walking distance. Overall it's a very nice hotel, maybe slightly over priced with not super friendly reception staff like in other Japanese cities.

It was our first time to Tokyo and first time experiencing Japanese hospitality. The hotel is in the Daiba area of Tokyo which is over the Rainbow Bridge on a manmade area. It has a train station right at its door on a private line Yurikamome Line which is not part of the bigger JR etc lines which serve a greater part of Tokyo. Therefore on the first day we paid to get a train to Shimbashi Station where we could get a 2 day unlimited pass for use on the JR lines. This worked well except we had to get tickets each time for this Shimbashi to Daiba part of the journey. Our room was on the 24th floor with the Bay view (view of the Rainbow Bridge etc) This was a nice view of Aqua City, the colourful bridge and the buildings of downtown Tokyo. We got to experience an earthquake from the 24th floor while we were there. Apparently centred north of Tokyo but felt in Tokyo. The hotel just gently rocked for perhaps a minute and the hangers in the closet knocked against the wall of the closet. These are common occurrences and the buildings are built to withstand these quakes so wasn't concerned. The room was large, the bathroom well equipped and the bedding very comfortable +. There is free WiFi and lifts that you cannot feel or hear move but suddenly you are on the 24th floor. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the concierge desk very informative, patient and eager to assist. There is a private limousine bus service to and from the airport which was comfortable and efficient and costs the same as the train with the advantage over the train as there is no having to get on and off with suitcases while transferring to different stations. When I booked the hotel I was given the info re getting to the hotel with different options but really the taxis are exorbitantly priced and the Limo bus costs the same as the train and takes the same time so really it was a no brainer for us. Aqua City is right at the door and contains shops, restaurants and a Starbucks which is open until 11pm (last order 10.30pm) if a late night coffee is needed on the way back to the hotel. There is also a 24 hour convenience store right at the hotel door also which is very handy. The hotel also runs a programme which if you are staying a certain number of nights or more, you can opt for a number of days where your room is not serviced in exchange for a donation to a charity or a credit to use in the hotel- a good idea which is environmentally friendly. The hotel was really well priced and we would definitely stay here again.","Auckland, New Zealand","AucklandWiz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",235,5.0

We found a good deal through Qantas for a triple room and ended up staying in room 1234 - an easy number to remember! We flew into Haneda which is much closer to the hotel than Narita. Though the hotel offers a shuttle bus there was none at the time we flew in (nor were there any early enough on our departure day for our flight out) so we got a taxi to the hotel. Just to be safe we had the lovely girls at the customer service desk at Haneda write out the hotel and address in Japanese for the taxi driver. The taxi cost around AUD $60 each way. Onto the hotel room! The hotel room was a little dated but clean and large enough for 3 people and 3 large suitcases which I'm led to believe is not common in Japan so that was good. I didn't like the beds or pillows, I thought they were too hard but my dad thought they were fine - so I suppose it's just a personal preference. We had a fair amount of noise issues with the room above us, but that's also just the luck of the draw unfortunately and nothing we would fault the hotel for.Make sure if you're not a smoker you select a non-smoking room as the smoking floors absolutely reek of cigarette smoke even in the hallway.The hotel is in a great location for access to the city outside of the hustle and bustle (and the sky high prices of inner city hotels). There is also a lot of good shopping and dining around on Odaiba to keep you occupied if you don't feel like venturing into the city some days. There's a monorail station just outside of the door on the 'Yurikamome' line which you can catch to 'Shiodome' or the following station 'Shimbashi' and then change depending on where you'd like to go. You can also walk just outside the hotel and onto the footbridge towards Aqua City and get a great view of the Rainbow Bridge and the Statue of Liberty replica. Room service was a little expensive so we never tried it and the pool facilities were closed when we were there so I can't comment on those either. Overall, we would probably return here again if we came back to Tokyo as it was convenient and suited our needs. A few tips for you if, like me, this will be your first time in Tokyo:-Make sure you bring your own adaptor as the one the hotel provided to us didn't fit our Australian plugs. -If you're like me and use data when you travel, a data sim from b-mobile will do the trick. You order them online and have them posted to your hotel and they'll be with the concierge when you check in. http://www.bmobile.ne.jp/english/-Get a Suica card at the station for the train so you can just top it up with cash and tap on and off the train - so much easier than buying tickets every journey. Also, make sure to get a complete rail map! Different lines in Tokyo are operated by different companies/the government, etc so some lines aren't on some maps and in some places there are two stations (one for metro and one for JR lines) - my lonely planet guide only had the Metro lines on its map and it caused us quite a bit of confusion at first. -For shopping the best nearby malls to GPLD are Diver City Tokyo Plaza, Aqua City Odaiba and Venus Fort - all within walking distance via the footbridge connected to the hotel. -The best western dining we found was in Aqua City.

Great location to the surrounding sights and multiple shopping malls, they offer a bus service into shinbashi station to transit out to the rest of tokyo. Otherwise the light rail experience is also highly recommended but slightly more expensive. We got upgraded with a direct view onto the waters and it was magnificent!

The hotel is out of town in Daiba but is very well connected with a elevated railway station outside the hotel entrance. Its also near quite a few big malls to satisfy one's shopping needs. The rooms were large with views of Tokyo Bay and are well appointed. The decor of the hotel is a little dated but the common areas are huge and don't feel crowded even with a lot of guests around. The restaurants are nice. We had a fantastic steak lunch in one of them. Good for lunch and dinner but not recommended for breakfast as its very expensive and you can get very good breakfast in cafes near the hotel. Wifi is free and in room dining though expensive was very good.This hotel was known as the Le Meridien Grand Pacific Tokyo and service levels are what you expect in a large five star property. Very good but a bit impersonal from some staff.The hotel was very prompt in answering emails and accomodated our requests including early check in (for an extra charge).

I believe this is exactly what makes this hotel perfect. A getaway after the hustle and bustle of crowded tokyo. For quiet seekers, look no further, this is the perfect hotel for you.Train Stationis within 3 mins walk, and they have setup a pedestal bridge for hotel guests to get to the station. This station gets you to mainland in less than 15 mins. If you're confused on which tix to buy, just call and ask the guy in the ticket ofc. They're mostly helpful.RoomClean, efficient, properly done, yet small for a 5-star.

It is a scenic 10 minute above ground train ride to the busiest hubs in downtown Tokyo, less than 30 minutes to Haneda airport and more shopping malls than you can visit in a week within walking distance. This area is open, nice to walk and not crowded and is populated with amusements to the Science museum (home to Asimo the robot).Now about the hotel, its great for tourism and for business. For runners or early morning walkers, this is the best location in Tokyo as it is virtually impossible to get lost. It is also among the nicest hotels in this area called Daiba in the middle of everything. The rooms are large by Japanese standards and very well appointed. The views over Tokyo and the harbor are beautiful both day and night and since this is a sparsely populated area for skyscrapers, (and people) they offer the best views in Tokyo. The hotel itself has about 7 restaurants, but if you walk to the nearest waterfront mall just 2 minutes outside the main entrance, you will have more restaurant choices than you would ever need. Again this is a very friendly area to walk as everything is visible due to the open spaces and unique landmark buildings that surround it and your mall and entertainment choices are second to none in the Tokyo area, things to do for all ages. Of course as with all of Japan... Very safe.The reason I did not give this hotel a 5 star rating is that in a city where service at high end hotels is super attentive and engaging, the front staff at this hotel was neither. What was remarkable was that as we arrived into the lobby to check in, no-one came to take our bags despite there being several staff available. Even as we walked by on multiple occasions daily, there was very little staff interaction or acknowledgement. (This was a first for this level of hotel in Japan.) The service at the restaurant was also remarkably slow considering that it was hardly busy when we ate there. The food though was very good.","Sarasota, Florida","srqkalu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sarasota, Florida</strong>",142,4.0

I had no idea the reviews of the hotel were so true until I arrived and from the start greeted by polite and helpful staff who escorted my wife and I to the reception area, but just walking into the main entrance foyer was amazing!Christmas decorations at this hotel are amazing with a huge tree in the main lobby, and on the 30th floor entry very nice table decorations.Easy access from Narita and Haneda Airpor'ts direct to hotel on Limousine Bus.This is a huge hotel in a superb location, an hour from central Tokyo, depending which part of Tokyo you want to visit, but the Yurikamome monorail outside the front door will get you into Shinbashi and Ginza in 40 minutes and by train to places like Akihabara, Shibuya and Shinjuku, Further afield JR rail to Nagoya, Kyoto, etc from the rail stations at Ariake or Shinbashi.The main foyer has eight lifts to the guest rooms, very little waiting and the view from the Bay side on the 25th floor was amazing. Can see right across to Haneda Airport, Tokyo Bay, the under the bay tunnel, the monorail system, and just a delight at night.On the other side (more expensive rooms) for the Rainbow Bridge views.Breakfast is served on the 30th floor, very crowded, little choice, and small room, on the morning we visited, their was no view due to the rain and fog!The room was very nice, except the TV was on our left with the bed facing towards the window!! Bed was very comfortable, and you can call housekeeping for pillows that would be more suitable. I requested firmer pillows as the ones were very soft, and they were delivered within minutes. But taken away the next morning, and had to request them again the next night!! From the second day they got the message and left the firm pillows on the bed!We needed to iron some clothes and a very modern Panasonic iron with small ironing board was delivered to the room, and we had for the rest of our stay!The room had three phones, one beside the bed, on the main writing desk and in the bathroom!On the writing desk and beside the bed were charging points for electronic devices, plus free use of adaptors will be delivered when requested. Calling by phone for items is easier than waiting at concierge or at the front desk anyway!The English language was very good throughout the hotel, and communication was excellent in most cases. Housekeeping staff were very difficult to talk to, as they run around looking for someone who understands, and really it is not necessary for them to do that, but they willingly help. Just fabulous attention to guests at all times.Television for English guests is deplorable. There doe's not seem to be television provider in Japan that has the possibly of transmitting US or British TV into the country to be made available to hotels by satellite, but they do provide MTV, CNN and NHK, varies by hotel. Hard watching constantly repeated news and sports all the time. Therefore, when the weather is winter as we experienced, theres not a lot do, other than shopping malls, and Odaiba has the best. DiverCity, Aqua City and Venus Fort, palette Town. Transport around Odaiba from hotel is free with the Bay Shuttle, timetables at Bell Captains desk. Runs from 11am to 8pm.The hotel also provides the free Disney shuttle to Disneyland and DisneySea, bookings a must, leaving three times in the morning and returning from the parks from 6.20pm. You can purchase Disney tickets from the Disney store at Aqua City, and avoid the wait on arriving at the parks. They do run out for Saturday and Sunday sales, which means you need to purchase at the park booths.Other than the buses trains will get you to Maihama from Tokyo Teleport station with a change, and takes 17 minutes. Just by the front entrance are shops including a 24 hour convenience store, but only a five minute walk to Aqua City mall with the best hamburgers at the Hawaiian restaurant looking out to rainbow Bridge and the bay. Tokyo Tower is easily a stand out at night just beautiful views.The guest rooms do not have mini bars! That is surprising as everything else is just fabulous and to have some drinks and snacks in the rooms even at a cost is better than not having a choice at all!I strongly recommend to hotel management to consider the modern use of mini bars and then this hotel would be beyond perfect for sure! Seeing an empty mini fridge was disappointing!They provide complimentary mineral water free every day, fantastic toiletries, bidet toilets, our bathroom had a window with views of the harbour, just fantastic.Room service menu was good, but in reality very disappointing. We ordered the steaks, thinking we would have a huge meal with vegetables, and requested bread rolls. What was delivered on a mobile table, set up like dinner for two, was a small piece of fillet steak, small serve of fries, two slices of carrot, small piece of broccoli, two glasses of water with ice!! and this cost for two $88.00AUD! Very expensive and hardly a meal of substance. Plus we did not get any bread rolls!Overall, this is a beautiful hotel, with restaurants, specialty shops, an art gallery, gift shop, bridal salon, spa, massage rooms, pool, fitness centre, and it is breathtaking just taking a walk around and viewing this spectacular hotel.Guests dress very formally here in this hotel, and we felt a little uncomfortable in our Aussie shorts and tees, however, we never felt the cold as the other guests obviously did, and we must have been a bit of a surprise, as we were enjoying the cool days compared to the hot days in Queensland!All in all we were made welcome at all times, and were shown respect at all times, and enjoyed the amazing experience at this wonderful hotel in Odaiba, which even provides souvenir postcards in the writing compendium in the desk drawer and freely available from housekeeping staff.Wifi was instantly connected and there was never any problem or drop outs, perfect wifi connections in all of the hotel.Free Shiseido samples are provided amongst the toiletries, and 'milk' available from convenience store, not in the room.I would without hestitation recommend Grand Pacific Le Daiba and hopefully will get ton stay again in the future, leaving was the hardest thing ever!","Surfers Paradise, Australia","AussieTravellers2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surfers Paradise, Australia</strong>",204,5.0

The hotel is situated right next to the monorail which takes you directly into Tokyo and therefore links straight into the underground system and the overground rail network. The fares on the rail network are very reasonable so we found this hotel to be perfect for visiting all areas of Tokyo. The hotel also has a coach service taking you direct to Disneyland which is a must. Just on the doorstep of the hotel is a convenience store selling everything a local convenience should sell. A large shopping centre is just round the corner, as is the Museum of Emerging Science which is well worth a visit at 620 yen.(See Assimo in action and see the planetarium).

Our friend recommended it. It situated at Odaiba, an artificial island at Tokyo Bay. I thought it is a good location which served our need, and not as crowded as compare to other area in Tokyo.Distance to Haneda Airport is quite close. If you won’t mind paying a little bit more, a taxi journey take only about 20 to 30 minutes (depend on traffic), around ¥5,000. Otherwise you could take the Airport Limo, which costs ¥520/pax.We booked for 5-nights which include breakfast. Check-in/Check-out service was efficient. We were given a double-bed room at the 18th floor, overlook to DiverCity, Fuji Television and Aqua City! Also great view of Rainbow Bridge! 2 pillows provided for each bed. Included Wi-Fi average speed is about 15 Mbps. There are multiple power points for all our charging need.We have a choice to 3 restaurants for our included breakfast.- Star Road, at 30th floor. It served International buffet breakfast, with great view of Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo Bay! Because of this reason, it is also the most popular one, and could get a bit crowded. You might have to wait a little if you are late!- Le Bouquet, at 2rd floor, Lobby level. It served almost identical stuff (buffet) as Star Road, but without the view. So it is more peaceful. Quality of food is good. Service was fine. This restaurant also served afternoon tea, and their cheesecake is marvelous!- Oshima, a Japanese restaurant at 3rd floor. It served Japanese breakfast set. We give it a try on our last day. it was mostly Japanese clienteles. If you want to know what is traditional Japanese breakfast, you should give it a try! Amount is sufficient, unless you are a big eater!Transport wise, Daiba station of Yurikamome Line is right outside the hotel. Westward it end at Shimbashi Station, which you can change to other JR/Metro lines to connect to the rest of the city. Ginza is just a short walk from Shimbashi Station.If you plan to visit Tokyo Disney Resort, this hotel is one of Disney’s Good Neighbor Hotel, and Tokyo Disney Resort Friendly Neighbor Bus make schedule pick-up/drop-off at designated time, but you have to book in advance. Once it’s full, the booking will close. The booking website is in Japanese, so it will be a bit difficult if you don’t understand.Alternatively, you could go to Tokyo Disney Resort by public transport. You could take Rinkai Line (from Tokyo Teleport, a short walk from hotel) to Shin-kiba Station, then transfer to JR Keyio Line (eastward direction). Alight at Maihama/Tokyo Disney Resort Station. Entire journey take only 30 minutes.I highly recommended this hotel, especially for those who are already familiar with areas like Ginza or Shinjuku. I find Odaiba area very comfortable with good shopping and dinning nearby (DiverCity, Aqua City, Venuse Fort). There are also some tourist attractions (Statue of Liberty, Rainbow Bridge, Giant Ferris Wheel, Gundam Statue).

This ride takes you over the beautiful Rainbow bridge which you can also walk in about 30mns. From the hotel you can also walk a bit further to the Tokyo Teleport station a take a train to Shinjuku.

It's located in the Odaiba, a man-made island in the middle of Tokyo bay. The location is a bit of a mixed bag, depending on what you want. If you want to be in the middle of the action as you've either seen in media or experienced in real life -- Shinjuku, Akihabara, Shibuya, etc -- then look elsewhere. But for myself, having lived in and worked in Japan in the past, I didn't need this. In fact, I needed the opposite -- what the Grand Pacific le Daiba provides: A relatively calm location - but still accessible via train to the cool parts of the city. My agenda was to relax in Tokyo for a bit before embarking on a difficult two-week business trip. And they delivered the goods. I booked a room that overlooked the Rainbow bridge. At night, it's a beautiful scene and I slept with the curtains open and it became the last thing I looked at before dozing. Lovely. Large bed with just the right amount of firmness. Shower had plenty of water pressure. Room is relatively large by Tokyo standards. (Though it'll remind you in size of a Courtyard by Marriott kind of room). If you don't book a room with breakfast included, would recommend you pass on eating in the hotel just on price alone. There is a 24-hour store (similar to a 7-11 or Lawsons) on property. In short walking distance are two huge malls with both restaurants and food courts to serve your every culinary desire. Much has been written about the hotel's location. This really is NOT a problem unless you proactively view it as one. Getting there from Narita or Haneda is simple -- the Airport Limo Bus stops right at the hotel (and departs there too). I came in via Narita (about 1 hr 20 minute ride to the hotel), then departed via Haneda (15 minutes from hotel to airport). Getting around Tokyo is actually easy. You want use the Tokyo Teleport train station on the other side of the nearby Diver City Mall. Trains there go directly to Shinjuku in a few short minutes. Piece of cake.I like this hotel. Would strongly recommend it to my family and friends.","Cabin John, Maryland","Hawaiiexpat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cabin John, Maryland</strong>",29,5.0

The Grand Pacific was offering a nice promotion for longer stays on their website so we decided to go for it. We didn't get disappointed. The reception seemed to be more efficient compared to the Nikko hotel but this can be a coincidence. The location is wonderful, easy and direct transport from Narita with the Airport Bus, what a relief. The monorail to the city center leaves next to the hotel, but OMG did we spend a lot of money on transport, you need to take a train to go to places in Tokyo, each and every time :-/With two shopping centres and plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood we did'nt take breakfast included. We went once to try the breakfast, I would say it's average 3/4 star quality, but then again I'm used to a lot so more critical. Never tried the breakfast at the Nikko so I can't compare.

Still.The hotel is in a great location on the waterfront with lots shopping and restaurants on the doorstep and plenty of things to see and do in the area. It has the advantage of being right next to the suburban train system which takes you into the centre of Tokyo in a matter minutes and the transport system is worst seeing in itself being efficient, on time, and everyone using a mobile phone or tablet as they travel.Both our rooms were large comfortable and well furnished.The hotel charges you to use the swimming pool.Staff are really friendly and helpful especially the concierge who provided us with all the information required to get around Tokyo including the train information, fares, stop details etcWorth seeing is the Imperial Palace and Gardens, Tokyo Tower, The Toyota Centre (a short walk from the hotel and free). Also visit the Shibuya scramble crossing which is organised chaos with a traditional shopping area.All the Japanese people we met were really friendly and helpful. If they see you looking a bit lost someone will come up and offer assistance. In the case of the stations which are very busy one gentleman came up to assist us and took us to the platform we wanted.Note, when using public toilets no hand drying facilities are provided in most so take a small towel with you.

A little patience, a smile and a few simple words of Japanese will get you a long way in situations where language is a barrier. The hotel is conveniently attached to the Daiba metro station which takes you to all ten tourist hotspots withing 20 minutes, it's very simple to use and I recommend getting a PASMO card which is like an oyster and debit card!

We upgraded ourselves (for and extra 10,000 yen/night) to the 27th floor, giving us access to breakfast on 30th floor, cocktail “hour” from 6-8, business lounge access (8am-8pm) and health club access, however, we didn’t manage to use the health club as there was so much to see and do! To be honest, if we’d paid for the breakfast separately, we might well have been disappointed, but the view more than made up for any shortcomings and the food was okay. There are plenty of other, cheaper options available very closeby, although I’m not sure what time they open.Our room, although upgraded, didn’t look out onto the Rainbow Bridge, but having “cocktail hour” meant we could see sunset over Tokyo, making it even more magical! It seemed that other cruise companies had put people in very basic, but more central hotels, however, we were exceptionally happy with this hotel - it’s no problem going into Tokyo on the monorail. This hotel is not basic – our room was small, but exceptionally well appointed. On arrival, we had fun putting our card in to make the electricity come on as we were doing it upside down! The water heater also took a bit of working out – you have to press the two buttons on the right to make water come out. Oh, and trying to be quiet, I went to the very snazzy toilet in the middle of the night and sat down, only for it to make quite a noise and frighten me to death!There is a lot to see and do in Daiba itself – four shopping centres in spitting distance – the restaurant selection is simply out of this world. We went to the Premium Sushi Bullet Train Restaurant in Divercity (2 minutes walk) – what an experience! Oh, and for a proper Japanese experience, do visit the Fuji TV building next door!On our first day, we went on a panoramic tour of Tokyo – it’s great as they pick you up at the hotel, then it drops you back in Daiba at the end of the tour (you can go back into Tokyo with them if you wish). On our second day, we simply took the monorail into Tokyo – it stops about 10 minutes walk to Ginza. When you’re there, it’s lovely to have a coffee on the garden floor of the Mitsukoshi department store, away from the crowds below.As a first time in Japan, this was an exceptional experience and without doubt, it classes as one of the nicest hotels we’ve ever stayed in.","Oldbury, United Kingdom","bryanmg141</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oldbury, United Kingdom</strong>",145,5.0

My only explanation would be that guests have not stayed elsewhere in Tokyo, and so this is all they know, and they were perhaps mesmerised by the experience of being in Japan? Forgive me if that's being patronising, but it's astonishing to me that so many people could rate this hotel highly.Firstly, it's not really in Tokyo, rather it's Odaiba, quite far from the centre. If you have any plans to be in central Tokyo after midnight, you're going to have to budget at least $40 per taxi ride back to the hotel.The hotel is not set-up for foreigners. It's probably the least foreigner-friendly hotel I've stayed in in Asia. Few of the staff speak good English and the written English in the rooms is comedic.The atmosphere is subdued and the hotel feels old. It reminds me a bit of hotels from the Soviet era - it's soulless.Nevertheless it's relatively cheap and just a few hundred metres from a very good shopping centre.I'm conflicted: you could stay here and have a great time, but there is so much more to Tokyo than staying in a cold hotel on the outskirts of the city.The rooms are small and uninspiring. The room service menu is pretty strange, and was probably not conceived with foreigners in mind.The opening hours of the fitness facility are nonsensical and the equipment is very Japanese: expect to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to change settings on the treadmill.To make the most of your stay in Tokyo, I'd strongly suggest staying elsewhere. If this is the only option, you'll still have a great time because Tokyo is a wonderful place.

On the google map of hotels near Tokyo Bay, this hotel seems ""close"" (NOT really) and taxis are very costly (a 5km taxi was almost $50 US!).The hotel is close to, but not really close to the subway either and requires an unclear 2 km walk but up and down huge staircases over busy roads. The whole Tokyo metro is probably the least user friendly I have ever experienced in a major city and there are few people to support or answer questions. You also have to take two separate lines to get to the Disney front gates. Total cost about 420Y.The lobby is pleasant and first impression is good.

The room size was good with two beds, a chair and ottoman. Odd corner room so the beds faced the windows with the TV far left, a little hard to watch in bed. I think there was one English channel, no BBC, no CNN that I recall.The hotel has free shuttle to the parks but they were full when I arrived or most the time which resulted in most of my spending to be on taxis! Why such low quantity of seats? Annoying.The hotel has a spa and indoor pool however its closed at 7pm!?? If this were a business hotel, one would assume after a day of business, its open to swim? If a luxury hotel, be open. If using the hotel as a Disney base, again, be open when I return exhausted form a day at the park. Never been to a hotel with indoor pool and gym not open at least until 23:00...and then of course, one has to pay for its use. Rubbish!In the evening, the lobby bar is a nice place for a nightcap. The bar on the 30th floor is closed at 23:00...are you kidding me? Why? Also annoying after a day at Disney to sit and have a drink and a nice view. Wasted real estate and bad F&B policy. At 9:30am for breakfast, there are two locations, lobby level or the 30th floor. I went to the 3oth floor and was given a table of two next to the window. I personally don't like sitting at a table next to the wall, facing out with my back to the room, so I asked to move. With initial hesitation, they agreed. I got up to go to the buffet and approached the omelet station where the chef pointed to a sign that had a big 7 on it???? I said I don't understand? 7 choices? I thought I might have heard 7 points....did the buffet have a total point value and as you selected items they deducted points from the allowable....so I went back to the front waiter to ask his assistance. We both went back, he asked some questions and also had no idea what 7 was about? I decided to just leave and try the ground floor, which now by 10:00am, was closed. The European concierge on the ground floor called up and learned that the sign says ""No eggs can be served before 07:00!"" Really? who cares....all that chef did was cause a bunch of annoying confusion and wasted time for me and others.I finally determined to return to my room, watch the news and order room service. At least four calls to room service for them to understand their own menu and bring me an omelet, toast, juice, sausage and coffee. Only $41US! Good meal but what a hassle for the most simple meal of the day. The room service chef taking the order could not speak enough English to even repeat the hotels English menu so again i called the concierge for help (same guy)...he's a keeper Mr. Manager!All in all, clean, renovated, but I would recommend staying at the parks or closer if with kids. When you have a highrise hotel that is most definitely catering to weddings or business, think of US business people or visitors that want to partake of the amenities on OUR schedule, not these limited schedules you have. The time frames are more like a small town location with limited staff?","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","jmptrips</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",84,4.0

The hotel deserves an excellent rating although it is not a brand new hotel, ie the amenities are not sparkling new, but it is a clean and well presented.

First, it is conveniently located right at the exit of Daiba station (monorail 'yurikamome' line), and it is especially convenient for travelers going to Haneda airport since it is quite close by, and we can easily arrange for coach transfer from hotel with the kind help of the staff. It may also be a good place to stay for tourists to Disneyland as they seem to offer direct transfer to Disneyland too. Second, the room is spacious with three single beds for us and this came at a reasonable price when compared with other hotels in Tokyo. Third, the location is great, although it is not right at the heart of more familiar Tokyo like Ginza or Shinjuku, it offers a new modern side of Tokyo, it is next to big shopping malls and also beach walk area, has the feel of open space in the otherwise crowded Tokyo city.

Went to the front desk, explained that I needed to print a document, not use a PC. The clerk stood there, open-mouthed, possibly understanding English but unable to respond. She disappeared into a back office a number of times, each time she emerged again she tried a couple of words of English but made no sense and stood there open-mouthed.After a few of these fruitless back office visits I suggested that maybe if I sent the document to them as an email, they might oblige by printing it off for me. After a few more visits to the back office, some English finally emerged: ""do you have hotmail?""So l requested that she send out someone who could speak and understand English; a management type came out and confirmed that: * Yes this is a 5-star hotel * No, they do not have a business center * No, there is no facility for printing documents nor would they oblige by printing off an email from me.So if you are on vacation and can afford to pay $30 per head for breakfast, this might be the place for you, even though it's not in really in central Tokyo.

The hotel was close to everything we wanted: Palette Town; great shopping at several shopping malls, excellent range of restaurants to suit everybody's taste within close walking distance;a train service second to none virtually at the front door, a free shuttle service around Odaiba Island and also to Disneyworld; The Mega Web which is a ""Look, Ride and Feel"" Car Theme Park that houses Toyota's City Showcase (which is a must-see item); and so the list goes on and on.  Another plus factor for this hotel was the easy access to and from the Airport using the shuttle bus service that picks you up and delivers you to the front door of the hotel. The only downside is that if you wish to go into Tokyo or the other suburbs you need to catch the train (or bus) which does cost a small amount of money and may take approx 30 minutes depending on where you want to go. But that is no problem as it is really no different to what you would find in most major cities in the world. In saying that, the train services run frequently and provide a service that is the most efficient in the world and As for the hotel, we found our rooms to be clean, spacious with a view overlooking Rainbow Bay and the water of Tokyo Bay. The bathroom and toilet area were excellent with a range of toiletries provide free; such as hand shavers, face towels; tooth brush & paste as well as the other usual toiletry items. With regards to organizing our daily travel plans, the concierge and the other staff were most helpful in giving advice and offering alternative ideas when the days weather was unsuitable for what we had planned.

We went to the buffet line. My wife and I we immediately disappointed with the food selections. The pancakes were cold, the only potato offering ""tatter tots"" were obviously an out-of-the-box variety, the rolls and breads looked and tasted as if they had been acquired at the local convenience store and the overall presentation of the food was downright awful, nothing looked appealing. Then suddenly at 7:00 the entire wait and buffet staff changed, a chef appeared from nowhere to offer custom made fresh omelettes but we had already eaten some rather tasteless scrambled eggs. When we left the restaurant we noticed that the omelette starts at 7:00. Why this hotel doesn't offer its full breakfast when it opens at 6:30 is beyond my ability to grasp! I suggest skipping the hotel's breakfast and go to Bill's Restaurant where we ate yesterday morning. It's half the price of the hotel's breakfast buffet and was really delicious.

($15 to ship a 50 lb suitcase from Osaka to Tokyo!). Ten days later, as we were still checking in at the Grand Pacific Le Daiba, our suitcase was brought forward. How did they know? Amazing.After checking in we needed to print out our luggage tags for the cruise, but couldn't get the pay printers to work.

Spacious, luxurious rooms, good food, fantastic views, capable & friendly staff in all parts of the hotel but most of all in a GREAT location Why? - 1. can walk 7 mins to ferry which goes across the harbour under the beautiful Rainbow Bridge, sparkly by day & all lit up at night, so very pretty & always busy! Connects with other sightseeing ferries to go up and down the harbour, as well as the river too. 2 can train it with the driverless train which runs literally at hotel door into the city for a very cheap price $3AUD each way where you can explore, shop and walk about. 3. you can walk across 3 different ways using overhead bridges to 3 major shopping centres which all have good eateries and restaurants which some overlook the Rainbow Bridge & so can enjoy good food & a great view whilst eating for a very reasonable price. 4. Can walk to the ""Statue of Liberty"" copy and admire as it's just at most 7 min walk. Can get free bus from hotel to Disneyland Tokyo , leaves 2 times a day and also returns & is for free each leg of the journey. 5. Can purchase airport bus transfer - about 1 hr travel time straight to airport, no fuss and hotel will handle your luggage, all makes it easier on that last day! 6. Is a great hotel with restaurant on the 44th floors for breakfast & dinner for everyone to enjoy, with spectacular views all over the harbour, all huge glass windows to admire through, of the Rainbow Bridge & all the boats plying back and forward - makes memorable scenery & gives a feeling of class and living the ""high"" life for a very reasonable tariff per night.

The finish area + expo was at the Big Sight which was about 3 stops on the Yurikomome. The Grand Pacific seems to be the best property in Odaiba based on reviews/photos. I would say those reviews were pretty much spot on. Our stay was fine.Arriving, we took the Limo bus from Narita. No connections and front door service. It was the 4th stop on the route, all in Odaiba. It took about 1 hr 20 min. Check in was smooth. The hotel is large and long/big hallways remind me of a big resort in vegas. The twin room on floor 8 was a decent size with views of the water/hotel nikko next door. The bed was comfortable. Only channel with English was CNN Japan... it seemed to replay the same stuff every hour. Not the same programming you see in the US. The hot water maker was nice. Instant coffee/tea bags are provided. I must say, the instant coffee wasn't bad! It did give me an excuse to try out Starbucks Via so I picked some up while I was out. Only 2 single plugs to really access. Walls a tad thin, heard someone running around upstairs... possibly a child? Heard a siren and maybe a loud motorbike...no other traffic from the street below. There is a freeway on the other side of the hotel so I can't comment on that noise.The bathroom was really small. I hated how the water leaked out of shower to the floor. There is a lower area with a built in floor drain keeping floor dry. Every time the shower or even the sink runs, you have water noise. The shower is handheld and when you have it on the cradle, it's difficult to get under. The door locked back when it opens so it stays open. It's a nice touch however in the middle of the night when you want to close the door, it makes a loud noise which could wake up someone. We gave the buffet a try one day only. It had a decent selection but mostly things you really don't want for breakfast such as salads, pasta dishes, etc... it was stuff Japanese would want to eat. The assortment of breads, meats was fine... eggs was scrambled with cheese. The fruit was fine if you could get to it. We saw a sign that said it gets busy around 830 so we went at 700 and it was already busy... the line was 30 deep. The coffee was great, luckily we were seated near there. The views were great if you wanted to constantly rub the condensation off the windows. So, when we left around 745 they were already taking numbers as there were many people waiting to get in. I say it's okay to try one day but don't pay extra for room cost with this buffet included and def don't pay for breakfast up front while checking in.The gym is really spacious and nice. It was a tad busy however still pretty good. The equipment was nice... the cost was 1150 yen a day which included the pool, spa, etc...There is wifi in the room but decided to use the rental mobile wifi I had rented for my stay in Japan. I had this delivered to the hotel and was waiting for me when I checked in.The Daiba station is behind hotel, about 5 min walk from room. There is a 24 hr convenience store along with a few cafes/restaurants you'll see on the way.Aqua city/Deck's & Diver city are all within walking distance. I would say about 10 min... each has restaurants. Venusfort is better reached by train or 20 min walk.","Las Vegas, Nevada","Anthony31</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",34,4.0

Designers and promoters of certain anime and other entertainment properties will contact the hotel to create these rooms, and will often lend props and other materials. The attention to detail is astonishing – from wall art to bedsheets, from coasters to the toilet-seat cover, absolutely every aspect of these rooms remain “in theme.” The two Gundam suites (each representing a different opposing faction from the anime series) include special edition models, decals on the windows that give the illusion that spacecraft are flying around outside, and even, in one case, a Gundam cockpit with flashing lights and noises. Such atmosphere is not cheap: you're talking $300US a night if not more. But if you are the consummate fan (and if you, unlike me, would not be terrified of somehow marring or wrecking these beautiful things), this place is a find. Like many things in Japan (and unlike the crass blaring advertisements of the rest of Odaiba), this is something kept very quiet...you just have ""to know"" it exists...and so now you do!Again, my rating represents the artistry of the rooms, and the friendliness of the sales staff...I did not stay the night so I can comment on nothing else.","Boston, MA","Skiold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",95,5.0

A hotel that was served by the Narita Airport Limousine bus service, as we had to catch a morning flight out of Narita. Transiting between train lines very early in the morning is not an ideal choice when traveling with 2 teenagers and 2 kids.2. A direct bus service between Disney and the hotel. We did not want to take the train at 10pm and having to manage transfers and walking with tired kids.3. Near a train/metro station for our other travel plans.4. Free internet connectivity (this is to avoid hefty roaming charges).... and we found one in Tokyo, at 'ok' Japanese rates.The major surprise was that I booked (not by designed) ourselves into a 5* hotel in Tokyo. We did not expect that, as our previous experiences before told us not to expect a full 5* resort for the price we paid. It wasn't cheap, but at Tokyo Bay standards, it was good.We got all the 4 items above and more. The station was attached to the hotel; and there was free internet in the rooms. Wifi router was needed, otherwise just use a LAN cable to get online. the router could be obtained from the Front Desk.The location was on Tokyo's 'island' resort of Odaiba. Even without DIsney there was enough indoor theme parks to entertain the kids (Sega Joypolis, Legoland, Madam Tussaud's, Museums and speciality malls). Another added bonus was that the island was also serviced by Tokyo's water busses. Though takes longer then the trains, we could get to locations by the river banks (eg Asakusa) by boats. It's more scenic, and the 'bus' stop is about 3 min walk from the hotel.Food wise there are enough choices around the hotel for your choice of meals. Fast food chains and branches of Tsukiji sushi shops are available. (Ok... it's not hotel food, but I am not a fan of hotel restaurants).Staff were friendly and helpful; from lost wallets to packing our wooden samurai 'swords' (my daughter lost her wallet at a nearby mall, and they had called the hotel to inform that someone had found the wallet and ask her to pick it up. The hotel not only informed us, but also followed up with us the next morning, and during check-out).Room amenities were plentiful. I admit I am a sucker for complimentary toothbrushes, & razors; these guys gave more then that, and 1 each for all of us (confession time: we took some back - they were good - the orange batch salts were wonderful).Overall, we were very pleased and impressed with the hotel we stayed for the week.","Subang Jaya, Malaysia","imkj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Subang Jaya, Malaysia</strong>",35,4.0

It's a five star hotel in Odaiba area in Tokyo.Room: 10/10The room I stayed in was quite big and completely shattered my expectation and assumption that hotel rooms in Tokyo would all bevery tiny and small. Well, I guess the price makes for the spacey rooms.Hotel Staffs: 9/10The hotel staffs are very friendly, nice, and well mannered (I find that most Japanese are very well mannered). However, as an international 5 star hotel, not many of the staffs speak English and the one who speaks English may not have the best spoken English skills. When I tried to find something to do during the New Year's Eve, I asked one of the staffs and had quite a difficulty talking to them. But, they are still the best. In my opinion, they are very very helpful and informative. I can see how they tried very hard to answer my questions and gather as much information as they could to make my time there a great one.Location: (9/10)This hotel is located in a strategic location in Odaiba area. It's close to shopping malls (Diver City, Aqua City), public transits (Daiba Station on Yurikamome Line), amusement park (Joypolis), and a lot of goo restaurants.Views: (9/10)The hotel has some great views.

Very European feel with great in-room amenities, including an overnight make-up kit for women. They have a convenience store within its property if you want snacks or drinks. I didn't try any of their restaurants though because there are so many cheaper options outside the hotel.Lastly, we used the free Disney shuttle provided by the hotel. Took less than 30 minutes to get there which was quite convenient. You have to reserve a spot at the bell desk but being off season, there was plenty of room.I really enjoyed this hotel.

And seems to be busy all the time! Because I was part of a group, the check-in was handled by a separate desk, which saved a lot of hassles. The first thing that strikes you is its lavish marble and wood lobby, but in terms of architecture it could be anywhere in the world. But the place is littered with the polite bending and bowing and ever-smiling staff, so it could be only one place in the world - Japan! The room I stayed in had a view of the Tokyo Bay/rainbow bridge, which was really out of this world. The view was awesome in the day and even more spectacular at night. The speeding trucks and cars were disappearing into the underwater bridge, as if they were being swallowed and spat out at the same time. As expected, the room is lavishly appointed and was large. The best thing about staying in Japanese hotels are their super-intelligent toilet seats. Here too, it was no exception - the warm seat and the features it has is pure indulgence - all this for only using the potty! The bathroom is large and the amenities the hotel provides is superb. Frequent travellers would love the plethora of brushes and shaving razors and towelettes and what not. I had a dinner buffet and for a vegetarian in Japan, it was no issue at all. Besides the food was good too. Similarly, breakfast was lavish and tasty too. For breakfast there is an option to go to one of the top floors instead of going down to the lobby - I missed it, as it would have been breakfast with a view. There is nothing negative to say about this hotel except for its overtly western outlook in a beautiful and culturally strong country like Japan.","Mumbai, India","srinik69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",81,5.0

First of all, to get free Internet in the room just sign up for the frequent stay program, I Prefer (http://www.iprefer.com/iprefer/index.aspx). We also received a free room upgrade! This was my first trip to Japan so I cannot compare the room to other rooms in Tokyo, but our deluxe room was the same size as a room in the US in a Sheraton or Hilton. The amenities, I can't say enough about them. Besides the usual soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion there was a razor with a small tube of shaving cream, a brush, comb, toothbrush w/toothpaste, hair band, q-tips, makeup remover pads, a Japanese style wash towel, a skin care kit, bath powder for the bathtub (btw our room included a shower stall). And they replaced anything missing everyday! In the drawers was a pair of packaged nightshirts that were also replaced every day, and if you needed children's size pj's you just had to call housekeeping. The hotel decor is a little dated but let's face it, do you stay in the hotel all day? Outside the bathroom was a vanity with mirror, very helpful to let someone do their makeup/hair while someone else could use the bathroom. And yes, not all the staff spoke perfect English, but we started asking our questions a couple of days in advance and eventually we'd find someone that could answer our questions. The monorail is a 1 minute walk away from the hotel, and a free shuttle goes to the Takanawa Keikyu Hotel in Shinagawa which is a 5-10 minute walk away from the JR Shinagawa station. The 1st shuttle left at 8:30 and ran every hour on the half hour, the return every hour on the hour, the trip taking between 20-30 minutes. Disney had a Good Neighbor bus that picked us up and took us to Disneyland and Disney Sea. This shuttle bus was free but you had to make reservations, only ran at certain times during the day, and took about 30 minutes to get to the parks. A 10-minute walk away from the hotel was Aqua City, a shopping mall like any other in the US, and included a McDonalds. Further past Aqua City is Decks which includes Joypolis, an arcade/amusement park. A 30-minute walk the other way (or you could take a free shuttle or pay 300 yen for a monorail ride) was MegaWeb/Venus Fort, a mall/outlet mall/Toyota showcase. Oh, and yes, the warm toilet seat was a kick, and I really got used to the toilet flushing sound every time I sat down, I kinda miss it.

The view and night was ""over the top"", and beautiful during the day too.We stayed in three other five star hotels during our visit to Japan, and frankly we found the service here the lowest.

It is a large and luxurious hotel and our room was spacious and well-appointed. We had reserved the ‘airport side’, which is cheaper than the ‘bridge side’ but we found ourselves in a room on the end of the building, so we had a great view in both directions. That was a nice little bonus. The bathroom did not have enough water pressure for a good shower in the mornings, but it was fine in the evenings. The shampoos, etc. are in large refillable containers, which seemed a bit odd for a luxury hotel, and seemed a bit watered-down, but we might be mistaken about that. We only ate one meal in the hotel – a lunch in the Italian restaurant, Collina Del Mare, and it was very good. We asked if breakfast could be included in our room rate, but we were told that it couldn’t be, even as we were watching some other people checking in and being handed breakfast vouchers. We also asked if we could earn frequent flyer points, but we were told that our room rate was too low so it was not possible. The moral of this story is that we should pay more!For a luxury hotel, they do a few things that seem pretty cheap. For example, we could have used the internet in our room – the cable and connection were supplied – but there would have been a charge. There was a computer in a tiny alcove off the lobby with a coin box attached – 15 minutes for 100 yen - about US$1). Why don’t they have free internet, wired or wireless? It seems like a reasonable expectation these days. Also, they have a fitness center, including a pool, but it costs 1,050 yen to use, even for registered guests. As it turned out it was closed for a few days of renovations while we were there, so we couldn’t have used it anyway, but again it’s a cheapskate thing to do. One other thing was annoying – both to us and a friend who was traveling with us: the staff in the lobby. There are too many of them. Walking through the lobby is like running a gauntlet. They are all just standing there waiting to pounce on everyone who passes through. They want to be helpful, but sometimes you just want to walk to or from the elevator without being helped and guided along. It’s overbearing. However, these criticisms are mostly minor, and overall the hotel is very comfortable and quite a nice place to stay.","Sidney, Canada","Jo B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sidney, Canada</strong>",109,4.0

You just step out of the hotel room and it's there. It is a little ride(just about 15 mins) out from Shimbashi (very close to Ginza), but it's a really nice ride over the Rainbow bridge and the train was never that crowded so you always got a seat. There's also alot of shopping around the hotel aswell. There is a shopping centre just about 3 minutes away from the station and then Venus Fort shopping centre is just about a 10 minute walk aswell, which is a must.
