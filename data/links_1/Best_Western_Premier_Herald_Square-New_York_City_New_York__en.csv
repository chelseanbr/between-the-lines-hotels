Every morning, a full breakfast is served, and free tea and fresh coffee are available in the lobby. We didn't drink in the lounge/bar of the hotel, but we talked to others who found the atmosphere friendly and inviting. Our most pleasant experiences involved the staff: housekeeping supplied us with items we forgot or needed more of; the breakfast crew served up a pleasant good morning, and the front desk accomodated us when we forgot to check-out (because you Will sleep well) and arranged for another room at reasonable rates when we extended our stay. Thanks to all of you! Finally, if you like to city walk, this hotel is in the center of Manhattan. You are close to subway and buses (use Moovit to navigate your route). And get out and walk! The greatest way to see the city. Central park is about 3.5 miles with stops at the Met and other museums, and Greenwich is about the same with a slight detour through Times Square.","Pasadena, California","Dan M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasadena, California</strong>",4,5.0

Yes, the rooms are small, but if you are expecting a large room you better be ready to pay a large price! For the cost, these rooms are fantastic. We were on the second floor, but you couldn't really hear the street. My friend and I travel together often and she struggles to sleep in hotels, but not here! We slept well every night.

Second it’s location is smack dab in the middle of everything. Look if you want a view go book at a hotel double in price. I used to do that, then I realized I spend 90% of my time outside of the room. So I really look for location, amenities, price, and most of cleanliness. This place had all of it. On top of it being a clean room top to bottom, they checked me in at 12:30pm. I’ve stayed at a ton of hotels in my life, I’ve never been able to check in that early. The staff was completely gracious and amazing, and even printed my concert ticket for me too. All I can say is I had three rooms I booked and cancelled up until I chose this place and I’m extremely glad I did. I saved money and stayed in a clean hotel in one of the best locations in nyc.

The following day I was told my cash was in the bank already and could not do anything. They were able to charge me a night, and I explicitly asked to be fully charged before arriving, so I think they only wanted the cash. I was given no receipt, so I asked about it in order to get back my 200usd deposit before leaving... I must say all staff was very inexperienced, I have never had such a bad experience in the world, not even when no one spoke English.The room was large, comfortable enough, TV kept buffering though and it was very cold at night because of the poorly insulated windows.Location is good, price was 1150 usd for 9 nights which is kind of a good deal for NY, but if I knew I would have encountered these issues I would have booked at a fancier hotel.Overall this is an option if you cannot afford more (especially for being on 36th street) , but don't expect luxury of any kind.

So kind, introduced themselves and gave great dinner recommendations. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. They are normal size for New York. Our room was on the back side of the hotel, so there was not a view. But what we did have was the ability to open the window and get some fresh air. It was also surprisingly quiet when we did open the window. We only utilized the breakfast area once. It was a typical spread, but the bagels seemed to be fresh from the area.

We spent so long looking at where to stay for our trip to NYC having never visited before, so pleased that we decided to book here. The best feature of this place is its location, its in walking distance to Times Square, Top of The Rock and The Empire State building. We also walked to central park one day this took about half hour. FYI Bryant Park is very close and worth a visit. Food wise we ate out as this is NYC and you have so much choice from dollar pizzas to high end fine dining. The hotel does a happy hour for drinks early evening and this was worth it before going out. Breakfast at the hotel is delicious and the pancakes and maple syrup are insane. There is a little Irish Bar / Restaurant 'The Keg Room' opposite the hotel and they have basketball games and sports playing at the bar, we loved this place. Our room was a standard room and I can honestly say its the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, although I understand this is a standard thing for NYC.

Breakfast is extensive with two kinds of eggs, sausage, hot and cold cereals, bagels, toast, fruit juices, muffins. The one thing I would change is the king bed length. A normal king bed is at least 78 inches. I am not sure if part of the issue was that part of the bed was under the headboard but my 6 foot husbands feet hung over the bed when he slept.

Lots of choices to choose from such as eggs, bacon, pancakes, and waffles. You can also have hot coffee and tea. By the way, do visit the hotel bar for its very excellent priced drinks during happy hour and do remember the hotel is located in mid-town Manhattan. Say hi to Farrah, the bartender for she is so nice, helpful, and friendly. Do remember to bring your BOGO voucher for the drinks. Lastly, if you are a Best Western member, you can also get an additional 250 points if you spend at least $20 at the bar. Do tip Farrah nicely for she deserves it. As a Best Western diamond member, I was recognized by the front desk and I did get a bag of goodies. They also had a function to request for amenities and it was sent up to your room within 30 minutes without charge. This is something I expected from five star hotels such as Hyatt and Hilton. So, for Best Western to do that is something I appreciated. On a side note, they also gave you extra requested amenities, so that was nice and generous.Yet, one let down amongst everything else being so good was the $25 gift card voucher. I did submit the gift card printout to the front desk prior to check in and it has been almost two weeks already, but it was not deducted from my total charges. I hope Best Western customer service will reply soon to my email in regards to that issue.

Worked out in the minimal gym - treadmill didn't work, and there were only weights, no mats or balls or bosu, so I guess not many people use this.

Having stayed with a couple of bigger chains in New York, I hoped from other reviews that this smaller hotel would have more of a personal touch. We were not disappointed.  It’s location is great, round the corner to Macys and Empire State Building, ten minute walk to Madison Square Garden and Times Square district. The staff were very welcoming on our arrival. Check in was very smooth. We were allocated a room on the 6th floor and told about hotel amenities. The rooms aren’t as big as some we’ve been in, but they are well designed, lovely comfortable large bed, plenty of tea and coffee replenished each day, and lovely toiletries.The complementary breakfast was very good. For us there was more than enough choice. The dining room has limited capacity, but even at its busiest we didn’t have to wait for long for a table. We used the hotel bar, lovely staff in there, and the happy hour is very good value with good quality drinks. The biggest thing I want to acknowledge and thank the reception staff and house keeping staff for, involves my husband and my reusable Starbucks cups. We brought our inexpensive reusable Starbucks travel cups along to use to purchase coffees, and also use instead of disposable cups for the complementary (good quality) drinks in reception. On our last day, I realised the cups were missing, we had used them each day up until then. I reported this to reception who not only investigated as promised, but initiated the lady in charge of housekeeping to actually go out and purchase us lovely Starbucks travel cups as a replacement. She acknowledged she had spoken to the lady who had done our housekeeping, who had mistakenly thrown them out, believing we didn’t want them anymore. Thank you for your excellent service, your courtesy- and also to all staff concerned for your honesty. It was brave of the lady to admit her mistake. Fabulous stay, and you really went the extra mile. We can’t wait to visit gain x",,MummyMG,16,5.0

After walking 30 km in one day, a cleansing ale or five is just what you need and the bar is quite pleasant. There's a great laundry just across the road which did a fairly big load of my washing for $14. The same load in London cost me 37 pounds sterling! There is also a great restaurant, the Kegroom, just about 50 yards up the road where you can get a great feed for not too much money.

One of the bartenders has tricks he uses to cheat customers.I was an easy target for the bartender to rip me off. My husband ordered a beer, approximately 4.50 dollars, and I paid with my credit card. On the receipt I got to sign, it did say 20 dollars and I didn’t understand why. Instead of asking, I thought it was some kind of suggested tip, and that I was supposed to write the amount I wanted to pay. There were line for tip and a line for total. So on the line for total I wrote the amount I wanted to pay. I wanted to make sure I did right and asked the bartender but he just dismissed me. The whole thing ended up with me paying the beer over 25 dollars. When I later that night went back to ask the bartender why he charged me so much for the drink, he was very rude, asking me why I would sign a 20 dollar receipt for a beer, he had ‘all’ the receipts except for mine etc. Of course I made the mistake of not questioning why he charged me 20$, trusting the hotel’s bartender, also not asking for my own copy of the receipt. However the main issue here is that the bartender had the intention to rip me off which I think is so sad. I hope he had a good time with that extra tip. As far as I am concerned, I learned a lesson. And in my opinion, he ripped me off.Furthermore I informed the staff at the reception who promised to look this up, but no body from the hotel cared to get back to me.","Malmo, Sweden","337sabinap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malmo, Sweden</strong>",2,3.0

I won’t make that mistake again. However, I was very satisfied with my Best Western Herald Square choice. Great location. Smooth checkin and checkout. The rooms are small like many in NYC but tastefully decorated and a delightful place to come “home” to after a day walking the streets of NYC. Attention to detail is important to me so I appreciated the earplugs though I didn’t need them and the amenities provided and/or available. And...i know this is weird but I loved the fresh caulking in the bathroom. Felt clean and healthy. I had breakfast the first morning but decided to pass the second. Usual fare, clean but cool scrambled eggs don’t appeal. Easy access to all kinds of transportation with a staff who are actually eager to be helpful.

The fellow that took care of the bags & brought them to our room was also very polite smiley & willing to do whatever it takes to keep guests happy. The reviews I read said the rooms were small.

Debbie arrives at 430am to make the REAL scrambled eggs & quiche. There is another young fellow working down there.

My criteria is reasonably priced, good location, clean, good service, complimentary breakfast, fitness center.Pros:Convenient location in Manhattan CleanFriendly and efficient serviceComplimentary breakfast with hot and cold foodsFree newspaper in the lobbyFree Wi-FiComplimentary coffee, tea and infused water in the lobbyCozy bar in the back Hot shower which feels good after a long dayCons:Small rooms - tight quarters just for sleepingBasic fitness roomWalls are thinI shopped around for a hotel that was clean, had a good location, reasonably priced and if possible, have complimentary breakfast and Best Western Premier Herald Square fit the bill. I know in New York, especially in Manhattan it is difficult to find a reasonable price for a stay and usually the best deals are directly on the hotel websites. I am a gym rat and I knew there was a fitness room and hoped that I could get a good work-out there.When my friends and I arrived, we were met with friendly front desk and they put us in rooms right next to each other which is great! I loved most of the amenities: free wi-fi, complimentary coffee, tea and infused water all day in the lobby, coupon for buy one drink, get one free in the bar. The rooms were small but clean.I noticed on the first day that the light in the doorway flickered out and left a note for housekeeping and when we returned that same day, the light was fixed! The second day, we were tired from walking and sightseeing and came back to the room to rest but after about 20 minutes, we heard a loud noise and it was apparent that a maintenance crew was doing some repairs in the room two doors from us and it sounded like they were in our room as they were shouting and talking loudly. So much for our naps but they did not realize anyone was in the rooms on our floor. The second day we came home around 5 from a long day out and wanted to rest and we found that housekeeping was just finishing up cleaning our room so we had to wait in our friends' room next door until she finished cleaning up our room. We thought it was a bit late but I guess it was a busy day for housekeeping.In trying out the fitness room, it is located on the lower level near the dining room and it has the basic equipment along with wet wipes, towels and water. There are no mats for stretching or extra props like stability or bosu balls. Of course the room only fits 3 machines: cycling, treadmill and elliptical and free weights. So you can get a basic workout there. We also checked out the cozy bar in the back and it has two big screens to watch sports which we did one night and we used our buy one get one free drink coupon. It was inviting and the bartender didn't rush us out at closing as the basketball playoffs had gone overtime for 5 minutes, and she let us watch until the end.As far as the complimentary buffet breakfast goes, it is well worth the stay but a heads up is get there before 8 am as it gets crowded between 8 and 9 am (hours are 6:30 to 9:30 am). Service is quick, friendly and efficient and the staff are attentive, and welcome you and point you to an available table and clean up tables quickly so turnover is fast. There is a variety of food available, fresh fruit, juices, hot and cold cereal, hot foods like bacon or sausages, scrambled eggs, omelettes, waffles, a toaster to heat up your bagels or toast, pastries, yogurt, coffee and tea so you have much to choose from. The location is good and easy to walk to Times Square, catch a subway or catch a tour on Big Bus or any of the other tour buses. We found that Times Square and Broadway can be very congested with people and cars and we ended up walking to and from the theatre district due to the congestion of cars. We did take Uber and Lyft during our stay and it wasn't a problem getting to our hotel. I got alot of walking during this trip and that is part of my exercise routine.

We had to turn it off due to blowing on our heads ... then the room got a little cold as it was extremely cold in NYC while we were there. For some reason the shower water sputtered and we never did get a good flow. The breakfast room is on the lower level, was a good size and had a lovely variety of breakfast foods.

There were fresh ear plugs on the night stand when we arrived, but we did not even need them- I never heard much street noise.The room was tight for 3 adults, but we expected this knowing hotels in Manhattan tend to be quite small.

The linens left something to be desired (clearly clean, just not high quality - one of our towels had a hole in it), but again, for the price point, we weren't upset. The shower, however, was great! Fantastic water pressure and hot! This was so nice since we visited during a cold weekend in January (temps in the 20s F) and needed to warm up after spending all day walking around in the cold.Another reason we chose the hotel was for the convenience of having breakfast included. Breakfast was fine - bagels, pastries, eggs, sausage, waffles/pancakes, yogurt, coffee, etc. We opted to skip breakfast the second morning to find something a bit nicer. In retrospect, given all the grab-and-go options in NYC, I probably wouldn't bother with breakfast at the hotel. The lobby had ice water, hot tea, and hot coffee 24/7 - nice bonus.The staff was great - very pleasant and helpful. Ryan stored our bags for us upon arrival (before our room was ready) and after checkout (so we could come back for them before catching our train).

The Best Western Herald Square far surpassed my expectations. Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by the front desk crew, who were terrific helpers. The morning breakfast was equivalent to any 5-star hotel, with an incredibly professional staff. All this and at worst a 16 minute walk to the theaters and Times Square!! By the way, Macy's is just around the block. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget that is still looking for a little class in their New York City stay.

The staff were so friendly and always happy to help this includes front of house, housekeeping and breakfast room staff - so everyone really! Our rooms were on the 14th floor and were compact, clean, quiet and had everything you needed for a comfortable stay. Breakfast was plentiful with a variety of foods on offer over the 5 days.You cannot beat the location of this hotel with many attractions within walking distance and subways close by.

We were in a room in the back of the hotel and never heard a peep from anything outside… No sirens, no traffic, no nothing did we hear. Our view was of another building, but we prefer quiet over a view. Our room was very small, but as they say, this is New York City so that is the norm and it was fine with us. It was very clean and had all the amenities that we needed such as coffee and very nice toiletries. Breakfast each morning was very good and just added to the overall enjoyment of the hotel. There is a lounge area in the back of the hotel, the drinks are reasonably priced and you can sit outside if you want to. Every staff member that we encountered were very courteous. I would highly recommend this hotel as a very nice hotel to stay in and the best bang for your buck considering all of the amenities in the room and the breakfast each morning. If you want a room with a view, you would need to get a room in the front but it will be noisy. If you want a quiet room, get a room in the back . We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to New York City.","Mineral Wells, Texas","Jayjotx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mineral Wells, Texas</strong>",15,5.0
