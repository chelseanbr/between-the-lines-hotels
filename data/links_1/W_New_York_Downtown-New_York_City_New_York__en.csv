The location is great, close walk to everything in lower Manhattan. Rooms were updated and clean and staff was mostly friendly and courteous. This hotel is modern in both design and amenities. For example, a key is needed to operate the lights as in Europe, the mini bar had condoms (very smart) and there is 1 lobby restroom for everyone. Currently the hotel is going through some exterior and exterior renovations so there is no restaurant in the hotel. The mats in the elevator are changed throughout the day which is a neat touch.

The hotel is accessible enough from JFK either by train/subway or taxi and when you get to the hotel the lobby is located on the 5th floor.The friendly staff checked me into my room ""with WTC views"" on the 15th floor (#1505), and what amazing views they were! The mood-lit room was big and had a large bed, but the bathroom was a little small.Being on the 15th floor meant no noise at all apart from the occasional siren, but that's to be expected in New York, but no problems at all with sleeping.The bathroom was clean and well-stocked, but the shower was tricky to turn on without getting soaked in freezing water whilst you turned the taps on, a bit of a design flaw. Once the water was hot and you were showering, it was fine.As others have noted, there is no restaurant at this hotel at the moment, only the lobby bar which is available for drinks. The staff at the bar are friendly and chatty and made you feel welcome. However, I was surprised to return at 10:15pm Sunday evening to be told the bar was closing. I thought this was very unusual for a New York hotel bar to be closed by 10:30?!Being downtown is fine, there's plenty to see during a stay here, but if you're in New York for tourist reasons, you'll more likely to be on the subway to go to mid/uptown quite a bit.The free internet was ok, usually around 7-10Mb down/up. The hotel is a great choice and I would stay here again.

This is made worse as in Downtown, there are fewer eatery options. Staff was helpful and effective, not super warm. Reception is on the 5th floor. The entrance is a bit grotty. The common areas feel a bit small. They tried to make the Reception area a bit funky. My room was clean, nice and quiet, not huge though. It had some views. Overall an ok stay but not great.

Hotel is in a great location for exploring lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The first thing you are presented with is the restaurant being closed, which is evidently opening soon. This is a big drawback as there is no food in the hotel or room service beyond very basic room temperature items, which feels very sub-par for a W. Lobby is visually stunning, and all staff is lovley and very accomodating. The woman at the front desk was great and when I mentioned it was our anniversary- she took my keys back, made some adjustements and gave us a great room with a view of the world trade site with very cool window seating built in. So nice of her. Housekeeping staff in hall was excited to welcome us and gave us some free water bottles, which is always a nice touch. The room had a great view and bed was very comfy. Most W's I've stayed in have had some kind of ambient or indirect lighting and this one seemed like it should, but room was quite dark at night even with lights on. The bathroom is the saddest part of this experieince. I don't think the whole hotel has been renovated since it opened, but you can only tell in the bathroom and the hallways on guest floors. It has no counter space, and the shower, which should have a rainfall head and be lush, was weak in water pressure and kind of had an odd smell. Very dissapointing. Guest hallways were scratched up and felt more like a sad Sheraton than anything else. Due to staff I gave four stars as the hard product isn't their fault. Hopefully a reno is coming soon. One last thought is my worry about the W Hotels brand. What was once a vibrant brand with personality and quirkiness has kind of turned into what feels like a drunk party girl vibe judging by the lobby and such. It feels to have lost is place amongst some stronger brands in Marriott's portfolio like Edition and AC... Hope she can find her way again.","Stamford, Connecticut","Griffin P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stamford, Connecticut</strong>",24,4.0

The W Downtown is a fake-out. It's nice from afar, but far from nice. I stayed on the 14th floor and walked into to scuff marks on my room door, at eye-level which was weird. The hotel room itself was going for ""cool"" but pealing paint, a towel holder falling out of the wall and some weird bits of tape near my bed falling off made the room look like it was made by teenagers doing odd jobs on summer break. Location wise, it's solid. The bar on level five is OK but the fancy pictures make it look better than what it is. But really, it's the shoddy workmanship in the room that put this in ""do not recommend"" bucket for me.

When I went to the room, I did have a nice view of the towers but definitely not a larger room or suite as I usually am upgraded to.-The room was dirty with marks on the walls and a big stain on the fabric next to the window. The sheets were too short for the bed and the air conditioning literally blew right onto me during the night which definitely didn't allow for a good night's sleep.-There was a group of guys partying in a room down the hall at 1230 AM and when I tried to call the front desk, everyone I dialed either of the phones in the room, they simply hung up. I looked up the number for the hotel on the internet but when I dialed this, it said that the number was out of service. -The restaurant is under construction and so there is no room service-The hallways were dirty and there were bags of garbage in the hall from the cleaning crew in the morning.

It's 10 years old and tastes have moved on from the dark, foreboding entryway and lobby. The lobby is mostly empty because it is, in a word, bleak. It’s also uncomfortable in the way that only “fashionable” people can make something uncomfortable. The decor in the rooms -- sort of an IKEA vibe in white -- is getting shabby from a hard decade of use. The hallways are both ugly (I know, I know, it's a matter of taste) and beat-up.The views of Ground Zero are impressive if you want to pay for it. And I do like the showers (in fugly brown tile).But there are two things about this hotel that really put me off.First, it stinks of what the staff calls ""W Scent."" It's _everywhere_. And no matter what you do, no matter how many times you ask, no matter when you ask, even if you use the mobile app for Marriott gold members in advance of arrival, you'll get a room that smells of this low-rent perfume. (How good can it be when they must buy it by the gallon?)I've tried using the app to request a scent-free room; I've tried calling; I've pleaded with the front desk people. On my first visit, they gave me a room that smelled like 20-year-old stale W Scent; the window wouldn't open the crack that it was designed to so no ventilation was possible. It was agnoy.On my second stay, I got a room that smelled like only a small puddle of W Scent had been used before my arrival. On the second day of this stay, I left a note for Housekeeping pleading with them for fresh pillows that didn't smell like aged-in-the-barrel W Scent. That reduced the odor to a level where shallow breaths didn't choke me.But on the morning of my third night, I forgot to leave a note for Housekeeping. Returning from a long day of work, I discovered the room had been made up with what must have been a garden spray container's worth of W Scent.And that brings me to the staff. They're as inhospitable as one would expect of the gatekeepers to a dungeon, which is the best description of the lobby. Only the freakishly hidden lurker -- I mean doorman at the (dark as night) first floor entryway -- even said hello or good day to me during either stay.Expect Housekeeping to know you are scent-sensitive because you made a stink (ha, ha) about getting a room that isn't perfumed? Come back from work to discover an extra helping of the smell. Ask the staff on the mobile app chat for a W Scent-free room? Don't expect an answer. Ask for a paper bill at checkout? Be met with silence. Expect a smile from the dungeon keepers? Fuggadaboutit. It's as if the staff thinks that because they are in a ""boutique"" hotel (how exclusive could a Marriott chain property be?), they can be as snooty as they like.The bottom line is, neither the hotel nor the staff's attitude are aging well. I can only recommend this overpriced hotel to travelers for whom a whiff of fashion and smelling like dime-store perfume are your idea of a high-end hotel stay.",Boston,"yobyot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston</strong>",53,3.0

I mention this only to provide some perspective as to how much I travel and to demonstrate my loyalty to the Starwood now Marriott brand. On January 1, 2019, at approximately 10:40 pm, I arrived at the W Hotel in Downtown New York and was greeted by the Front Desk Attendant. It should be noted, I have stayed at this property on a number of occasions in the past. I asked if I could be upgraded to a suite and I was informed that this particular hotel does not upgrade Platinum Members. I was also told because I had several different reservations for different nights, I could not be upgraded to a suit. There was mention of a policy where by upgrade to suite could be no more than two night. I had several reservations because modifying a reservation on the website could potentially lead to me being charged for a cancellation of the original reservation - that could lead to a forfeiture of funds....so I customarily make additional reservations. At this point the Welcome Talent Coach Candice Baynes was introduced as the Manager. The Front Dest Attendant did inform me that there were only three suites in the hotel. So I asked Mrs. Baynes if there were any suites available and if there was, could I be upgraded? I was told that one suite was occupied, and one suite was reserved for the following day and the third suit was not clean. I asked if I could wait for the third suite to be cleaned I was told I could not. I asked if I could stay in the suit that was not reserved until the following day knowing that I would have to move the second day because of the ""two day policy"", and Mrs. Baynes said something about splitting the reservation being a problem. I thought I was fairly familiar with hotel vernacular but I must admit I didn't know what splitting the reservation meant. At this point I am totally frustrated. I have been in other W Hotels when the Manager has actually cleaned a room when housekeeping was not available. Mrs. Baynes not once offered a possible solution to my problem. On this particular night, Mrs. Baynes' managerial decision adversely impacted the bottom line. She literally lost money for the hotel when I walked away. I own a company...I am an employer. If I were Mrs. Baynes employer or Supervisor, based on the situation that I have described, I would have to question how many times a day is making decisions that are costing the hotel money?","Houston, Texas","Robert M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",0,1.0

However, there are a few things that made be not rate this hotel 5 five stars (which may not be a big deal to some - just my preference): 1. They may be understaffed because there was only 1 valet guy/bellhop guy my entire stay which means I didn’t get my car valeted lol He was gone taking someone else’s luggage upstairs. So he did valet and bellhop services. Never seen that before. 2. I called downstairs to get more towels and no one answered. 3. I woke up ready to get room service and ordered breakfast, but the menu wasn’t hot prepared food. All they had was continental breakfast ( no hot prepared food like eggs or bacon) and snack boxes. Disappointing for someone that wants to relax in their room and eat breakfast. I guess it makes you go out (check out early lol) and go explore the city. Overall, it was a good stay. Outside of the menu food options they just could’ve been understaffed that weekend. And I liked the location.

I'm a Gold loyalty member.Now to review the latest stay of five nights this month: - Had to request a coffee machine...and once I got one, I had to request that the coffee capsules be refilled each day because they ignored it in the regular housekeeping cycle- The button on the lift to the seventh floor only works on one side of the elevator. I told staff twice. Nothing changed. I don't like a guessing game when I get in a lift! - The ice machine on my floor was broken the entire time. I reported it 3 times. When I ordered ice three times from room service as a substitute, I had to repeat the order twice to actually get it.- I gave up on having the minibar refilled. I drank a small bottle of white wine from it on the first night and it was not replaced despite my repeated requests. - The restaurant was under renovation, so no food available. Instead, I was given a card with some restaurant phone numbers on them. Not menus, mind you...just phone numbers. Since most guests aren't from NY and the Wall St area, they will have no clue what the food offerings are without embarking on research. Thanks for the food research assignment versus (as a minimum) giving me a handful of menus and concierge recommendations. Just wow. - The room contained no guide to hotel services. I asked twice. Didn't get it.- Front desk staff and doormen were kept busy talking among themselves- Calls to the front desk were greeted with zero energy or interest- Had to call down to have dirty glasses replaced in my room. Housekeeping took the dirty ones and failed to replace them.- The ""do not disturb"" sign was ignored to deliver my laundry. Thanks for waking me!- There was hair in the shower drain the whole stay- Pizza boxes and various other pieces of food delivery trash littered the already grubby looking hallways. Apparently having no inhouse food delivery means they also decided not to service the hallways for used items. Disgusting.- My keycard stopped working and they couldn't figure it out. After me traipsing up and down for two failed re-attempts, they eventually got someone with a master key to let me in. All of this adds up to an incredibly damaging experience for the W brand. These are EASY things to fix. It's table stakes. Not getting the small stuff right doesn't give you a chance on the big things.","London, United Kingdom","MeandYu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,1.0

If you want something with cool sleek design, that has a night club/bar for a lobby that's really dark when you walk in, and a hotel room with angled designs and a modern look, then this could be a good hotel for you. Also the location is absolutely wonderful – – close to the subway, to the World Trade Center, cafés and shopping. The things that disappointed me are not aesthetic but matters of functionality: No electrical outlets by the bed. Even two star hotels have lots of electrical outlets by the bed these days… What on earth? Most two or three star hotels also will offer a complementary coffee throughout the afternoon. This hotel has very good coffee but only until 11. There is no kitchen or café or anything inside to get some food or a cup of coffee; they tell you to walk outside to a Starbucks or something. The lobby looks amazing but when you walk in it's so dark it's hard to see. So if I were going for a night on the town and wanted to stay in a cool looking place and I didn't care about practical things like coffee or food or electrical outlets and all the little things you just need, then I would recommend this place. For my trip I needed to plug things in while I was sleeping and would've liked to be able to get some coffee after 11 or a late night meal. 3 star hotels anywhere in the country have more practical conveniences than this hotel. However I am probably not the target demographic. If you don't care about any of that stuff, then this could be a great place to stay as it is really cool, has a great location, and has a really neat bar instead of a lobby.","Atlanta, Georgia","S7820JXkevins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",2,3.0

I just tried the W for a week and loved it. It is a bit like the premium discount airline: for a reduced services hotel, the W has a vibe and upscale decor charm that is designed to be provocative and edgy. I found the 5th floor reception area/lobby/great room/outdoor seating area/bar -- a compact space of about 800 sq feet to be very functional, upbeat and fun. I loved stopping by the casual bar to grab a beer. The game was always on the TV. Nice escape from the madness of the NY streets.The exercise center was never busy at 5am or 6am and had the treadmills and free weights I needed. I liked that the W has BLISS body products. Room was nice and the desk was very functional. Had a good view of downtown from 21st floor.This is a reduced services hotel. So I had to get breakfast delivered from one of the restaurants in the area -- breakfast came in about 20 minutes and was good. Room was quiet (21st floor) and no hallway noise either. Good sleep quality. SPG had my room preferences ready to go when I arrived.Would definitely stay here again, and some real advantages over the Marriott Downtown and the Millennium Hilton Hotel downtown.

I think they should have checked that while they are cleaning and servicing the room, right after the previous guest is left and before arrival of the new guest.Our room was not clean as if they were in a rush to make the room. The bed sheet had dark stains on it and even though we called the room service for that, no one came to change it. The next day, we put the “do not disturb” sign out till 10am. While living the room, we asked the room service person ( who was cleaning the room next door) to service the room and he noted that. When we came back to the room at 4pm, our room had not been cleaned. We left our room again around 7pm and asked for it to be cleaned. We put a note on the bed sheet ( right next to the dark stain) asking for it be changed. When we came back to the room around 12 in the morning, the room was cleaned but the sheet had not been changed! There was no coffee maker in the room, which I think is normal for NYC hotels. They do serve coffee at the lobby from 9-11am, so if you are a coffee lover, you should go outside for your afternoon espresso or order through room service.We like to hang out in the Meatpacking area and this hotel is far from there.

Things like the elevators were not in prime working condition - just about every day at least one elevator was not working properly.The staff were simply okay. They didn't have much enthusiasm or passion. Pretty laid back. Mostly helpful, but nobody went out of their way to stand out positively.The hotel also lacked the typical W vibe. There was not an ounce of ""hip"" in this place. In fact, the fifth floor (main lobby area with bar) was dead every time we went down there.One final thing. Several reviews talk about the roof top bar. This is a misnomer. You can't access the rooftop as a hotel guest as the top floors are residences. The supposed rooftop bar is actually a terrace on the fifth floor, outside the bar. So, if you fancy a view from floor five, go right ahead.

I have stayed at this hotel multiple times ONLY because it is very close to WTC4 and my client when I am in NYC. The facilities and service are poor, as noted by many other reviewers. The restaurant has been under renovation for more than a year! But the straw breaking this camel’s back is extraordinarily poor (even rude) customer service. As also has been noted by other reviewers, it makes no difference what your SPG status in this hotel—there will be no accomodations. If there is a problem, the front desk staff consistently are unconcerned and slow to resolve it. (I was once told by a W FD manager in San Francisco that they hire people for attitude. Really. Certainly this hotel seems to do so!)I called down to the desk on the third morning of my last stay at this hotel because there was no bottled water in the room (this is a frequent problem here). The FD person I spoke with said that I needed to stop. I was on my way to an 8AM meeting and told the staff member that I could not do so that morning because I was on my way to a meeting. I asked why and the FD member did not give me a reason.On my return to the hotel that evening after a full day of meetings and a business dinner, I was locked out of my room. There had been some issue with my business credit card and the FD insisted on a new card. I do not willingly put business charges on my personal card. So after I realized that I would not be allowed into my room to resolve the issue, I asked for the FD manager. He, Alex, eventually came out and told me that I would not be permitted into the room unless I gave them a different card. We argued about this for a very long time. I called platinum customer service and they spoke with Alex. After some further lengthy discussion with Alex, he told me that he would send security with me to my room with me so that I could resolve the issue with the business card. That was fine with me and said so. Alex ended up giving me a key, but did not send security to escort me. I went to the room and resolved the issue in about two minutes after I had access to my computer. I then packed up and called the front desk to say that I planned to check out. After a brief argument about that, Alex agreed that he would not charge me for that night. I moved to another hotel. I will never return to this hotel. The entire FD staff was rude. I was locked out for more than an hour. I am certain that it is illegal to seize possessions in a circumstance like this. It is within the hotel’s rights to terminate a stay, but not to hold a guest’s possessions hostage. I realize that the credit card issue needed resolution, but this was entirely the wrong way to go about it. At one point during our very uncomfortable conversation, I asked Alex if he was concerned that the hotel would not be paid for my stay. His response was “no”. So the whole interaction seems to me to be about power. So I will exercise my power to never stay there again and to tell others what kind of treatment the hotel gives guests. One other point to make—the hotel apparently left a message for me on the hotel phone. That is a poor way to contact a guest. The phone systems in hotels are universally awful. One SPG hotel in LA where I stayed frequently sent marketing messages every day. I learned to ignore them. Anyone of interest who wants to reach me calls me on my mobile phone. There are other ways to reach guests. The hotel had my phone number. They could have left a note in the room. But assuming that a guest will listen to hotel messages on hotel phones is a bad assumption.If you want to enjoy your stay and be treated with respect by hotel staff, I would recommend staying elsewhere.",Seattle,"MerleB00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",11,1.0

I have inform the staff that on that particular day was my husband birthday and well i do expect a small gift(a cake) from them. But sad to say, we did not receive anything at all. We are not being calculative but for other countries(just name a few, Sydney, Australia, BKK, Bali, London) we were being surprised with cake & flowers in our room.

Basically the person would not let me talk to the manager at all and then when I asked for the manager name he told me the first name Jamila and when I asked for the last name he said I can only give the initial. Basically they all hide so no one can take responsibility. Beside being curt and rude on the phone the manager hides behind the employees instructing them to not even give their names out. I’m highly disappointed that they didn’t try to work with me. They have my 300 dollars and a empty room they are probably renting to someone. I never come across such inconsiderate staff and they are smart to not give their names on the phone so that way they can hide because that is all the staff does. If you want to pay top dollar for bad service and rude people who don’t solve any problems go right ahead and book here. There are plenty of nice Starwood or Marriott properties in New York with nicer staff and centrally located choose one of those. Unless you like inconsistent, inconsiderate people who do nothing to accommodate you. Manager needs training and staff needs major training.

FIRST, there is no parking at the hotel and the website is misleading as it FAILS TO SPECIFY that you MUST park around the corner and deal with people that simply were not friendly. Why not just let travelers know up front about the parking being offsite. SECOND, the room was not nice at all! I would have used another word, but TripAdvisor doesn't allow it. Not that the room was filthy, i.e., dirty, but instead, there were HOLES IN THE CURTAIN. The holes allowed unwanted sunlight to enter the room, waking us up when we wished to sleep in. Really unfortunate given that we traveled from far to visit NYC, and rest, relaxation, and room service were all we wanted. THIRD, and even more egregious, THERE IS NO DINING OPTION OR ROOM SERVICE AVAILABLE! Look, I truly understand that renovations happen, and reasonable people would expect downtime as a result. BUT THE HOTEL SHOULD INFORM GUESTS PRIOR TO BOOKING ABOUT THE CONDITIONS, AND THEY SHOULD NEVER USE THE WORD ""LIMITED"". Again, my wife and I visited for our anniversary and the front desks description of a ""limited"" kitchen amounts to no more than bagels and free coffee in the lobby. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HOT FOOD FROM THE HOTEL. For what we paid to stay here that, it is borderline criminal (fraudulent) that this is what the W provided us.

I had an amazing view of world trade and the room was a good size for an NYC hotel room but the older appliances and furniture irritated me. I’d skip this place and stay closer to Tribeca where there are newer boutique options. ,"New York City, New York","tristans34</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",44,3.0

I was booked for 5 nights and came in on a Saturday. The first thing I noticed was that setup of the hotel is a little awkward. You arrive to an elevator bank and take it up 5 floors to check in. It's a bit tight at the front desk and if you need luggage held they take it on the main floor.Upon arrival we had a room ready immediately which was great, however after getting into the room I realized it was an interconnecting room. I've had noise concerns at other hotels with this type and asked if it was possible to move. I was told nothing was available as it was only 2pm and check in was at 3pm but they could hold our bags. So we took the two elevator ride back down with our bags to hold them and left for a late lunch. We arrived back at the hotel after 5pm and was told our room wasn't ready. When questioning the time I was told my room was ready - however they gave me the exact same room. After about 5 minutes + of searching, they had another room for me - on a lower floor facing the west side highway, even louder than the first room. So I gave up and took the original room - it then took over an hour and 2 phone calls to get our luggage sent up. Not a great start.While getting ready to head out for dinner, the hot water in the building went out mid shower. We called down to the front desk to check on the issue and they said it would be back momentarily. 2 hours later, still no hot water. I understand emergency maintenance happens, but communication wasn't great here as they earlier told us it was back on when it wasn't.The first morning we were awoken at 7am by yelling and laughing in the room next to us. At first I assumed it was the hallway but discovered it was noise from the interconnecting room, just as I assumed would happen. This went on for over an hour. There was also a great deal of street noise. I've stayed in other hotels in the area facing the same streets and it hasn't been a problem, being on a higher floor I assumed we would be alright, but maybe the windows aren't as thick.We were woken up again after midnight the second night by yelling and pounding on the wall. I was here for business and up at 5am the next day so I called down to the front desk to ask for help - they said they would take care of it. 30 minutes later and nothing. I actually went down to the front desk and angrily asked for something to be done. Eventually security came up.The first two nights were definitely a struggle. Things quieted down for the next few nights. There was a Christmas party on the lobby/bar floor the last night and you could hear the bass from the music even 10 floors up, but it stopped before 10pm.Upon check in I asked for the bill to be split on my personal and corporate card. When I checked out they put it all on one card. I asked for the quick change and they were able to accomodate quickly - however when I checked my online banking I could see they flipped the two cards despite clear instructions - this required another call to the hotel. All in all, a frustrating trip.I will say this though, the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a good size. I also had a nice view of the WTC site. I feel like this could have been a nice trip but sometimes things don't work out nicely. I'm not sure if I'll give the W another chance on my next trip.",Canada,"cjauff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",61,3.0

We faced the freedom tower, so the view was memorable! It was also a lot more calm than midtown, with a toddler I appreciated, yet still easy to get to all the areas we wanted to visit. Expensive: On arrival we were tired so I ordered some toast. For 3 slices of toast, jam and butter, and delivered, plus tax this cost $15 we ate out after this.......... though they did offer free apples in reception could have bought a toaster for this!Cot:I emailed them before we visited, to ask for a cot. They said they would organise. On arrival there was no cot in the room. When I asked for it they said it would be $35 dollars per night!!! Again and for not mentioning to me prior?! Not good.

The staff were friendly and the location is brilliant if you want to be downtown close to the world trade centre and Wall Street. The frustrating: The booking process was difficult as the hotel website kept transferring me to the SPG website which showed different prices from the hotel website. When checking in the man at reception didn't recognise we had booked two rooms and required prompting. He also forgot to allocate our free wifi to our rooms. The bad: the hotel restaurant was under renovations which meant no in room dining or breakfast etc. Not a big deal but we were not told about it at all until arriving at the hotel - it would have been nice to know prior to booking. The room was very small with no where to put one bag, let alone two! The hallways were dark and a bit dingy. Would I stay here again? Yes - only if I needed to be downtown and if it was a good rate.

This is always our first choice and sadly we regret this one. The W New York-Downtown is not contributing to the good name that has been built. Cooperate should review the condition and policies of this specific location. I suppose I should just start from the beginning...At check in we were informed that there is no food on site due to construction. They did provide a long list of alternatives which was much appreciated. However, in reading past reviews apparently this has been a major complaint of being an ongoing construction project which I must admit, I hear the jackhammers across the street but there is nothing going on in this hotel.Once we got in our room about 10:30pm after a long flight the first thing we noticed was how damaged and dirty the room was but too tired to deal with it we waited until morning with the intention of moving to another hotel. Unfortunately the daylight made it worse. There were black marks all over the wall, mold rings in the sink, and the shower was unacceptably dirty. We booked our room through MasterCards BLACK CARD/LUXURY CARD and after calling the front desk to complain about the uncleanliness they said they would send a housekeeping manager to inspect it. No one ever showed up so we told them to forget it that we would call MasterCard to handle it. As soon as we said that, they agreed to move us but told us that they did not want to move us to a low floor(I'm assuming because the low floors are the reject rooms).Now we moved from the 8th floor to the 20th floor and we still have some cosmetic issues but it is actually a lot better. There's still mold in the sink and marks on the walls, not to mention the broken furniture, but the nicer view and shower floor that I'm not afraid to stand on sort of makes up for it. But all that considered not much of a change in cleanliness. And it's not just in the rooms that this is a problem. The lobby and hallways are all poorly maintained.Since we can't eat on property I decided I wanted to at least enjoy the bar. According to the website as of August 21, 2017 at 10:49pm the bar closes at 11pm. We strolled into the hotel after dinner around 10:30pm and was told that last call is 10:25pm so the bar is closed. This was obviously the last excuse I wanted to hear. So I called the front desk and the woman confirmed that it closes at 11pm so I inquired why the bartender told me there was a last call at 10:25pm but no mention of it when we checked in, on any of the hotel room information books, or on their website. Her response, ""I guess it closes at 10:30pm then."" It sounded like a fake reason not to serve us. I understand the W-Downtown appreciates us choosing them, business is business. And since this is a public forum that hotel staff replies to, I think any solution should be taken care of publicly. It might help some to know that the issues are getting fixed not covered over by an apology and no action. Again I just want to make clear that we love the W brand but this hotel does not do it justice.

I took one look at the l shaped wall and realized my room was backing up to and sharing two walls with the elevator shaft and hightailed it down to the front desk to ask for a move to a quieter location a little aside: many years ago, another Manhattan w hotel ""upgraded"" me to a room that was similarly sharing two walls with the elevator. since the hotel is clearly not full, it seemed kinda petty and cheap of them to put me in such a crappy location.my new room was 6 floors up with a sweeping view of downtown Manhattan and, wait for it, a sliver of a water view. a super functional desk spanned nearly floor to ceiling windows. bonus points for that. everything looked brand spanking new, clean and sparkling white. and yay for the bliss toiletries including a real bar of soap that actually smelled delicious. my only complaint were design choices: instead of bathroom tile, they used a vinyl substitute complete with faux grout lines. yuck. and the tv was mounted so high it was practically touching the ceiling. the restaurant is currently being remodeled, but this is Manhattan and who'd bother with eating in the hotel restaurant anyway? (unless you are staying at the ace where the restaurants are amazing.). be warned, wifi is NOT free unless you are an spg member and even though I am, I had to call down and ask for them to enter a special code into my reservation. not a big deal, but something that should have been taken care of when checking in.I absolutely loved the almost next door to century 21 location and as soon as I finished checking in, I hightailed it over there for some shopping. if you've never been to century 21, do not walk, run on over. the selection is high end, the prices not so much. and July/august is clearance time, so don't hold back.all in all, the w saved the day. it was amazingly clean. new enough that baseboards and carpets were still in good condition. and the staff, while not terribly proactive, was more than willing to change my room and give me a wifi code when asked. can't really ask for more than that this far south of two hundred bucks.",la,"jrnlmkr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>la</strong>",186,4.0

Loved the service levels at this hotel, everyone from the doorman to the receptionists and bartenders knew me by name and always tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms were quite large, and I did get upgraded a few times to corner suites facing the WTC Memorial. The hotel does not currently (July 2017) have a restaurant as it is undergoing upgradation, hence there is no Platinum lounge / breakfast buffet. However the last time i visited they did provide gift cards to use at the Starbucks around the corner, which I appreciated! Additionally because this hotel is situated downtown, it does get a bit quiet after 7 pm or so, and there aren't too many restaurant choices. The modern room design is also something that not everyone might like (black carpets, white walls and ceilings) and could possibly be improved with more light in the room.

The staff are helpful and friendly. You enter through sliding glass doors at street level off a non-busy side street (Albany). Bellmen greet you warmly and handle your luggage. An elevator with the always cool W mood music and aroma whisks you up to the 5th-floor lobby and lounge which has a wonderfully inviting patio and bar with views across to the Freedom Tower and the World Trade Center Memorial Park. Make sure you enjoy drinks or just hanging out on the patio - especially after dark. It's a great experience and the view is spectacular. The location is great for Battery Park, Financial District, Statue of Liberty. It is a long ride up to mid-town for theatre or sites there. SoHo is a twenty-minute walk but it is through fun, interesting neighborhoods. The area right around the hotel has plenty of inviting shops, restaurants and coffee hangouts. The now iconic Oculus mall and train station is only a couple of minutes away and absolutely worth visiting. As an SPG liftime Platinum we were upgraded to a corner room which had views on two sides to the Freedom Tower and Financial District. The room had all the hip whistles and bells we love about W hotels - latest tech gadgets, sleek design, floor to ceiling glass. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. The bathroom spacious, well designed with a big shower with excellent water pressure. On the down side, this W does NOT do Platinum upgrades to their suites. They wanted more money for that. Most other W hotels do offer such upgrades -- for example, the W in NYC on Lexington Avenue does it. The manager told me the suite was available but since it's so distinctive they need more money. That's unusual and disappointing. Also, the restaurant is currently being renovated so only some coffee was being served but this should be fixed soon.All in all, this is a solid W hotel with better than average views, helpful staff and I do recommend it for Lower Manhattan though they should reconsider their upgrade policy.","Leesburg, Virginia","Tim P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leesburg, Virginia</strong>",48,4.0

If you're looking to be close to a bunch of touristy stuff in midtown, this will be about a 30 minute ride by subway. But in itself, this is still a good location in the financial district. Our room faced the One World Trade Center which is a block away and it was spectacular, day or night (see photo). It's a several minute walk to the west side of Manhattan on the Hudson River, where you can walk along the river and get a distant view of the Statue of Liberty. Another 10-15 minute walk to the east side of Manhattan where you can walk the Brooklyn Bridge across the East River to Brooklyn. The hotel itself is modern and streamlined and reminds me of European hotels. The lobby on the 5th floor has a generous seating area, bar, and balcony overlooking the One World Trade Center (you get discounted drinks as a guest). You can get rooms in different sizes. We booked the ""Spectacular"" room with two double beds for four people and it was a little tight, but I believe a lot of mid-range hotel rooms in New York are like this.

After hanging out twice, it was clear we had an amazing spark and as a ""treat""- I rented a 2 night stay at the W Hotel.Not to be completely cheesy, but we definitely fell for each other in this hotel, and my favorite moment was after a wonderful dinner date and walking around NYC for hours talking, we went back to the room and sat on the bench overlooking the window together and looked out on the city in total silence. 3 months later we were in love and 6 months later we formally got ""together""It was a magical moment that I will take with me for the rest of my life. Over the last year, due to distance and life events, we've grown apart and decided to take a break from each other. I was in NYC on business for a few days and wanted to surprise him by recapturing that moment.I reached out to the W Hotel Manager with I was sure was an impossible request- was there anyway to find out the room I had stayed in 5 1/2 years ago? Or if not, if I could describe the room and the angle, could we get a reasonable similarity? The Director of Welcome Office, Mickey Steenberghe, was immediately helpful and was able to find the room number. He helped me book the room 2 weeks in advance and was amazing in communication - offering other treats and events to make the visit more magical. When I checked into the room, I was overcome first with nostalgia, but then with a huge smile as I saw the W Staff had strewn rose petals all about the room, including a large heart on the bed and a trail leading to the bench which now had decorative lights over it. A bottle of chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were on the desk waiting for us. My guy arrived a few hours later- he was extremely touched and we had an amazing time reminiscing and reliving those first beautiful moments where we connected. It's a bit too early to tell, but I think we may decide to give things a second shot when I move back to NYC in a few months. It was truly an amazing magical experience the first time around and Mickey's help to recreate the moment gave us both such a wonderful experience- I can't thank him or the W enough.

Upon check-in I was greeted by Candice who helped my wife and I get our stay underway. Candice was EXTREMELY professional, friendly and sweet. While checking us in Candice noticed our room wasn't ready and started to make some calls to speed things along. During this proceed we had some small talk and Candice learned that my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary so she went to the back and got us some passes to use at the bar which we did while we waited for our room. 15 minutes (or less as we were busy drinking) our room was ready which was AMAZING! Due to our original room not being ready Candice appear to have upgraded us to a better room which had amazing views of the Freedom Tower and surrounding area.

As we arrived at Penn Station from Philly, we called an Uber to take us to the hotel. It was a short ride of 15 mins max.The check in, you go into the main reception and up a couple of floors in the elevator. The reception is quite small compared to other hotels, but was nonetheless quick and the staff were friendly. Our room was located on a mid floor, opposite the elevator doors.

The room, and indeed hotel, is very modern, going for chick, modern lines as opposed to some of the dated features in US hotels.A couple of things that did surprise me about the room:1. No coffee machine! This is a 4 star hotel, so I would have thought it would come with a coffee machine. You have to ask reception for one;2. Lack of sockets! There were hardly any sockets in the room, so I ended up charging my phone in the bathroom, which isn't ideal. I did open a bedside cabinet draw, and found a jungle of cables with a 3 way adaptor, but I have to say, it didn't look safe to use! 3. The minibar was only half stocked. No problem as we didn't use it, but this did give me a slight concern incase we were billed for anything. I mentioned it to the front desk staff, who didn't seem too concerned!

I'd avoid this hotel like the plague. I'm an extremely loyal long time Starwood Platinum member, normally staying more than 75 nights a year, sometimes much more. My office in NY recently moved near this hotel, so this is my third stay, the last being the worst. I used to stay at the Chatwal midtown or the W on Lex, far superior hotels in every way, particularly the Chatwal.First, small thing but on all 3 of my arrival times, no one was there to help with luggage, and they are under perpetual construction it seems.Bigger problem- I can accept that there might not be an upgrade for Platinum members, but the front desk staff should at least appear to be trying to get you one, instead of downgrading your room because they gave it away. I had a prepaid King Bed room, they stuck me in a double bed room with a handicap bathroom which I don't like generally, and told me they would try to move me the next day, if they could. But the attitude was simply like they couldn't care less. I then made the mistake of ordering room service, because I was tired, and so for my $75, I got a very late steak sandwich that was stone cold, half raw inside on mushy bread that was soaked with whatever juices there were with a slice of squished terrible tomato and old lettuce, along with lukewarm soup and somehow a side dish of very hot vegetables. Next morning, I awoke to a leak of water coming down through the ceiling in the bathroom, and the seemingly somewhat helpful but ultimately incompetent front desk staff said they would make sure I was moved to a new room, and to just leave my bag in the room.On my return, late that night after a business dinner, of course, they had not moved me and there was only a tiny room available supposedly, now no view but at least no bathroom leak. I went and got my bag and moved myself figuring it would take too long for them to find someone to do it. The new room was small and terrible even for a W, but vven though I was staying for 4 nights, I didn't want to hassle moving again. This time, the front desk person was at least nice about giving me the crummy room and somewhat apologetic.Final two straws, I made the mistake of getting breakfast in their pathetic tiny temporary restaurant for the second time in 3 trips, to get a most incompetent waiter. He forgot the order twice, and checked and still it arrived wrong, he only brought coffee after 2 requests, then took a long time to bring milk, never brought water, never offered a refill or brought the requested one, and seemed way too overloaded to take care of the 3 tables that were there- and so I had mediocre overpriced food poorly presented.Final insult- when I got emailed my bill, they had jacked the rate up $200 a night from my already overpriced prepaid rate, even though the room was a clear downgrade that they moved me into, no view of the World Trade Center, and it was tiny and cramped.My first two visits were not as bad, but the level of service was still poor, no upgrades, and no attitude as if anyone cared that you're a Platinum guest. I'm going to mail this to the President of Starwood and tell him or her that they need to fire the manager and retrain the staff, this is the worst service I've ever consistently received.

Asked for a high floor and received it (thank you!). Also requested the reservation be put on my SPG account even though we couldn't get points, but wanted to use mobile room key. Didn't happen despite making arrangements for it in advance. Also requested a tower view (One World Trade) and didn't get that either.Good location for walking to attractions and the subway. Lobby is always dark and more of a club than sitting area. Example of this were a group of men interviewing for positions with the hotel and they couldn't read the documents at 9 am because it was so dark in the space.Overall the room was what we needed - clean and well appointed. Plenty of outlets to plug things in. Having said that, the advertising and 'trendy' nature was annoying at times. For example, the desk was filled with papers of information and their minibar offerings. Ended up moving all of this for the majority of our stay. Bathroom was fine but counter space is almost non-existent. Only one nightstand in the room which made it tough for someone else I was with to put their glasses or water down for the night. Did love the window bench though and used it to scan e-mail while looking at the city. One more quirk was the wind noise - the Saturday night we were there was really windy in NYC and every inch of the room made noise (creaking) the entire night. Not a big deal - just strange.Front desk staff was always friendly when we asked for basic directions or info on getting around.Gym was bigger than most hotel offerings and served its purpose the three days I used it.Overal a great experience for the four nights we were there.Check out the burger bar at the competing hotel just across the street - great food and atmosphere.","Chicago, Illinois","brianlV2766CF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",6,4.0

Actually, it is easy to get to Jersey City and Hoboken (with very nice spots as well to spend time) and Newark Airport (as the Holland tunnel is near), and the subway brings you easily to other places in the city. Soho is even worth a walk. Of course, there have been requests, which have not been fulfilled, but the hotel has always made good on any slip on its side – which is not the average experience in NYC. Therefore, design and staff are my reason to make the W Downtown my favourite in NYC.","La Caleta, Adeje, Tenerife, Canary Islands","adelyne2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Caleta, Adeje, Tenerife, Canary Islands</strong>",15,5.0

I just kindly told her what happen and gave her the resolution of just sending maintenance up tomorrow. She was rather mean and cut me off and said "" Theres no one here to fix that "" So I disregarded it. THAN I asked for a band aid. She ignored my bleeding leg and said to wait 10 minutes for it. I work front desk as well and I would never treat my guest in a manner. She than had a confrontation with my personal guest where she denied them access to the room. They had ID and the card that was on file. She said that because their name wasn't on the RSVP she was not going to help them with a key.

There is also an outdoor patio that gives you a closer look at the ground zero activities. The elevators a swift and cool. The rubber mats in them are changed three times a day to say ""good morning"", ""good afternoon"" and ""good evening"".The bar at the end of the lobby is also cool. A nice selection of spirits and wines is to be had and the bartenders are sports nuts who can and will discuss all manner of sports minutiae ad nauseam while mixing and shaking. My brother-in-law, the sports freak, was in heaven. The ladies at the bar were a bit piqued at being ignored by the buffed bar boy toys. Drinks run on the typical hotel high side. On this Saturday late afternoon, a wedding was getting ready to begin so professional photogs herded wedding party members into various groups. In all, the bar and balcony were festive and enjoyable on a beautiful day.Our room was large by NY hotel standards. Like the rest of the hotel, the decor was funky and there were few right angles anywhere. The room was clean and well appointed. It was a corner room, thanks to the upgrade, and, from the west side, we could see the Hudson River. The lighting fixtures were cool and sometimes difficult to figure out how to operate. There was a shortage of electrical outlets, particularly on one side of the bed but a power strip was provided inside of a drawer on the other side of the bed. We were able to plug in a CPAP machine and charge two phones. The flat screen TV was mounted on the wall and there was a blue tooth enabled speaker to listen to your iPhone music. The sheets and towels were clean and the maids did a good job cleaning the place.The visit was a great experience. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found $170.00 charged on my credit card. A check with the W found that I was charged $120.00 for parking (I had no car) and $50.00 for a bar tab. The W immediately credited the $120.00 parking charge and ""investigated"" the bar charges for a few hours before informing my wife via email that the bar charge was an ""error"" and credited that too.Honest mistake or rip off?

The housekeeping staff and bellman were extremely cordial and helpful. The updated room was very comfortable and cleanliness was about a 9 on a 10 point scale? It seems the walls are dirty? Though it is mildly inconvenient, I like the fact that you must enter, go to the 5th floor for check-in, and then take another (card coded) bank of elevators to your room. There was an almost overwhelming cloud of air freshener when we entered our room, but it either dissipated during our stay of we just became accustomed to it. Several newspapers are provided.

I think I got better reception in the middle of Masai Mara than in the middle of financial district. so I could not get any work done properly. also, I could find only 2 outlets in the entire room thanks to the minimalist design.

My daughter would just sit in front of the window and just stare outside, it was super cute. Our room attendant was very nice to us, she offered my daughter complimentary chocolates and juice.

Weird. Now to the reason I'm leaving 3 stars only. My boyfriend on our last day, went to take care of the payment, I had put my credit card down for the holding and he was going to pay everything at the end with his card. So the same guy with the blahh attitude at check-in assisted him and swiped his card for the amount of our stay. The next day once we were back home, my boyfriend tells me that not only did they charge his card for our original invoice, they also charged him an extra $800 dollars!!! We called the resort and asked what was going on and could not give us an appropriate answer simply we have nothing showing that we charged you that amount. Well someone charged $800 extra to that card since the name of the hotel was next to the transaction. After almost 2 maybe 3 weeks they returned the amount back on the card with a simple ""sorry for the inconvenience.""

Not too terribly much to complain about. I kind of screwed myself over with this one by booking an Ultra Cool Corner Room and then checking in after 8pm, meaning I was left with the least desirable one out of however many of these they have. Our view was mainly the back of another building, and I could only see the WTC by craning my head around uncomfortably. I did call down to see if they could switch us, but as I suspected, no others of our room type were available at that point. It was kind of a disappointing factor seeing as I deliberately booked this hotel and that heightened room rate to get the best possible view. But again, my fault. I was in hospitality, so I get it. Just a warning for others - if you plan on checking in late, you'll get the ""picked last for the team"" version of whatever room type you probably paid extra for hoping it would be amazing.Everything else was fine; the famous optical illusion bar design is even more impressive in person, and drinks were delicious. The unisex bathrooms were weird. I guess it makes sense though because millenials are super progressive, right...? And as others have said, I completely didn't get why the ""rooftop bar"" was on the 4th floor.

A friendly doorman and pleasant check-in staff made for a nice introduction. The room was typical of a W--once chic, but now looking spare and a little predictable; bed very comfortable; bath well-stocked; shower spacious. I wish there was a more comfortable chair in the room than the desk chair and the window seat, but this is a minor complaint. Skip the mini-bar options--they're greatly over-priced and there are plenty of nearby sandwich shops that can satisfy you. I'm in agreement with another reviewer about the lobby lighting: when the brightly lit elevators from the rooms open to the reflective dark marble floor of the lobby, there's an illusion of depth that makes you feel as if you're stepping into open space. Rather startling!

I travel constantly for work, so I understand the general ups and downs of the service industry. Not everything can be perfect all the time and this is never my expectation. However, when I put in effort to get things right and to make a special weekend happen, it is disappointing when I have an experience like this one. I booked this hotel through my chase rewards program. I specifically called the hotel, confirmed the rate I was booking and talked to someone there to ensure I would have a WTC view. This was an anniversary weekend and I wanted it to go well. There were multiple room booking options from the Chase site, with rates from $220 - $280+ for the single king room. I booked the more expensive rate (as it was told to me by the W staff I talked to) to ensure I would get the view and room I wanted. I also asked for a room on a high floor. This was ""noted"" on my reservation as I was told. I arrived that weekend. The staff member greeted me curtly to say the least. When I asked about the room, she said she saw ""no notes"" and that she would see what they have available. When I told her about the view, she said ""no, I wasn't involved in any other conversations about this and have no idea what you were told. The rate increase would be $50 or higher for the WTC view and that's pretty much final"". Considering my partner was standing there, I was not in the mood to start a debate or call a manager. It was late and we wanted to sleep. It was also apparently completely unimportant that the rate I paid for the room was already at least $70 higher than the listed rate on the W website itself for the same exact room. So, my anniversary was spent in a tiny, clean, and modern room facing another skyscraper. (The entire room also shook whenever there was wind and was rather creaky) It wasn't a poor room, just poor when I tried to make this a special weekend, planned ahead, tried to engage the hotel and was still left disappointed. I've stayed in starwood member hotels for a long time, and it is rare that I have as disappointing experience as this. Just as a case and point, we were supposed to spend 3 nights there. Instead, we changed our flight and left a night early. While I brought it up to the staff, the W refused to offer any kind of refund or recognize the issue. Even something small would have been nice. For the staff I talked to, It was an issue with who I booked with --- not sure, given that the W was providing the service, but again, I didn't press the issue. There is only so much time in the day.Regardless, I will likely continue to be a patron of Starwood hotels in the future. But this was by far the most disappointing experience to date. (I'm giving this hotel a second star, because at least the rooms were clean!) Finally, they billed me for a snackbox I never consumed. $8.45, after that weekend, didn't seem like it was worth the trouble either.",,IvashchenkoD,8,2.0

Very cool bar in the lobby. The staff at this hotel have to be some of the most uninterested, lazy and worst staff at almost any hotel I have ever stayed at and ruined part of the experience staying here. On Valentine's morning we decided to order breakfast and champagne in bed. I ordered the Healthy Start omelette which was supposed to come with all sorts of veggies inside and my boyfriend ordered and all American style breakfast which was supposed to have sausages eggs etc. Our total bill for the breakfast was $179 USD. When the breakfast arrived it looked like the staff had literally just thrown what they could messily on a few plates and sent it up. My omelette was just egg whites on a plate with NOTHING else no veggies nothing just egg whites (not what the menu said). A whole bunch of stuff was also missing from my boyfriends. We called down and they said they would re-make mine and send some sausages up for my boyfriend. He asked if they could re-make both of them since we were trying to have a romantic valentines breakfast in bed together and the woman told him mine would take 15 mins so he could just wait with what he had. He said no his food would be cold by then - so she informed us she would have to check with the manager if that would be ok. They called us back 15 mins later and said they would send us both a new meal. Not only did the whole ordeal take over an hour it was also at the end of the day a $200 meal for a s*&^ experience. I have NEVER been to ANY restaurant or hotel that has completely screwed up the entire meal and not comped at least the dishes they screwed up! #FAILThis wasn't our only issue. The entire staff seems just completely disinterested in their jobs. They aren't rude but it's just like they couldn't give a damn about their jobs or their hotel guests. The check-in was unpleasant.

Having read some reviews on trip advisor we were already aware of the layout of the hotel. Upon arrival we went to the 5 floor, then to the check in desk and we were sorted very quickly. Our room was on the 18th floor right next to the elevator and another electrical room. It was sometimes noisy but it never affected out sleep. Our view was on the opposite side not facing the infinity pools and it wasn't the greatest.Our friends who arrived previously managed to get a free upgrade to a room with a decent view of the pools. When we enquired about this they said it was unavailable or at a premium. So that wasn't a good start. But we weren't too concerned about this as we planned to be out and about as much as possible. The room was small but adequate, furnishing were good but the lighting was not the best. The bedside lights also flickered slightly. The bathroom and shower room was fine. The floor was cleaned adequately throughout the week and no problems were experienced. We also had a free safe and access to an iron and board. The hotel is very dark as mentioned by others which can sometimes make you feel strange. The hotel is pretty well maintained and clean. In the mornings there was free coffee and tea - although getting English tea was sometimes a challenge. During the day there was water available. The people at the front desk were helpful when needed. We didn't eat at the hotel and used the bar once or twice. I felt the bar was expensive - $9 a bottle of bud but $11 after the tax. So we never really used it. I used the gym 4 times - it is small with limited weights but adequate for a holiday. We signed up (for free) for a service that gave us internet access and this was very useful. I would advise you do this. All in all a very enjoyable trip. I would stay in this hotel again.

Tiny lobby crowded by a bar, with only one check-in desk, and everywhere. . . darkness. The policy-makers for the W chain think that darkness is cool—and it is if you are having or intending illicit sex, but probably not otherwise. The room, though small, is well designed, comfortable bed and bedding and nice toiletries, but of course, no one can read in the room because of the poor lighting.

There's plenty of subway lines connecting you to midtown and Brooklyn and the PATH train to New Jersey. It's a trendy hotel with cool curvy lighting in the ceiling of the lobby but it kinda resembles a disco more than a hotel. It's isn't cheap. I paid $600 for a 'spectacular' room midweek in November. Now for that you'd expect something spectacular but the room was a bit of a let down. The furniture was trendy but flimsy. There was no coffee machine or kettle. The bed frame was cheap though the bed itself pretty comfy. And the bathroom was rather utilitarian and due to poor ventilation there was mold on the ceiling above the shower. Also there's no bath tub.The good points; the view if you're on the north side.

There was always no milk by the time we got down at 9:30am. For the prices we paid, we wold have expected internet in the rooms. Also having retrospectively read from another review that SPG guest get complimentary internet in the rooms, it is rather disappointing that our ""welcoming"" staff didnt advise us of this (despite being SPG guests). So after a long day in the city, we had to contend with the music/party revellers at the bar while accessing internet (the balcony area was closed for construction work).This was our first time in NY so unsure whether this is typical of the hotels in the city.

No room upgrade was given as part of the benefit of the loyalty program and its seemed that our room didn´t have windows for all the noise that came thru.Our “ultra corner room” on the 10th floor was facing towards the air conditioned machinery of the adjacent building so all day long noise was coming thru; also on the mornings, all the noise from the construction of the park towards 9/11 memorial, was terrible. No complains about the cleanness of the room, washroom, carpet, towels and a comfortable bed, but staying at a pricy hotel, at least you expect isolate windows.

As often, we had chosen this hotel due to its location (our friends live around the corner). The atmosphere in the hotel felt very impersonal, the staff at the check-in barely looked at us while checking-in / having questions / checking-out. Nobody was greeting / smiling when leaving or coming back to the hotel. The interior design of the lobby is very fancy but also reinforced this cold atmosphere. The hotel room, which we got for a good deal (if we had to pay the regular price, it would have clearly been overpriced!) was clean, the design was ok. The room was small (in my opinion the room size was ok, my partner found it too small) and I especially liked the W-bed (very comfy). The safe did not work as well as the lamp in the closet; both got fixed / replaced within very short time. The isolation of the room was also very good, or we had very calm neighbors. We missed a good restaurant for breakfast. I tried the one on the ground floor once but was neither convinced by its quality, price or service.

I’m a fairly regular visitor to that part of town—I have a close friend in Battery Park City and a nearby hotel is the best guest room ever. I usually stay at the Marriott, right across the street from the W. On this trip I thought I’d try something a little different. I have to admit, my arrival experience was a bit disconcerting. I walked into the hotel, suitcase in hand, and then it took a half a second for me to realize that the lobby wasn’t on the ground floor. Call me a slow learner. And once I stepped into the elevator and couldn’t quite figure out which button to push, since none of are labeled anything quite as boring as “Lobby”. I think they might call the Lobby the “Living Room”.But once I made it to the front desk, the hotel hit its stride. The desk staff couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful and soon enough I was on my way to my room on the 18th floor. My room was compact but well appointed. It was done up in the modern chic style that the Ws are known for, but it wasn’t so modern and chic that I couldn’t figure out how to work the lights and to flush the toilet and all that stuff. The bathroom was just the right size—I never quite have seen the point of a bathroom the size of the Pentagon. The shower was so nice that I wanted to pack it up and take it home with me—spotless, great water pressure, and toiletries that didn’t come from the Dollar Store. The room was quiet at night, and what can I say about the mattress other than that I slept like a log? I loved waking up and looking out the window from my bed to the Hudson River—whoever designed the window knew how tall the bed was going be. Simple, but very nice. On my second day at the hotel, I made the egregious mistake of bringing a soft pretzel back to my room with me. Soon enough I had big bits of white salt all over the black carpet. Shortly thereafter I left the room and on my way out asked the housekeeper if she could give my room-which she’d already made up—a once over with the vacuum to take care of the pretzel detritus. She couldn’t have been nicer, viola, when I returned no one would have known that I was stupid enough to try to eat a salty pretzel while standing on black carpeting. Later in my stay, I had to ask someone at the front desk to help me with my bow tie—they never come close to presentable when I tie one. Presentable was no problem for the young man who helped me with mine...picture perfect was all in a day's work. It was the kind of personal and professional service that made me say to myself, “I’m so glad that I stayed at here.” I’d stay at this W again in a heartbeat—especially now that I know that the Lobby, er, Living Room, is on 5.","State College, Pennsylvania","KhakiGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>State College, Pennsylvania</strong>",10,5.0

First, location. It is called the ""W New York Downtown"" and if you are not familiar with the various parts of Manhattan, it is in a great location in the Financial District, one block from the Freedom Tower and the 9/11 Memorial as well as within walking distance of many waterfront attractions, including the water taxi to the Statue of Liberty. Thus, it is away from the insanity of Times Square; there are no costumed super heroes trying to get paid for a picture. The only downside of this is that it is a bit of a haul up to Times Square or Broadway and the Theater District (we were in town for, inter alia, ""Mama Mia!"") The rooms are nicely appointed albeit a bit on the small side. Check-in is not a street level but on the 5th floor and, after a swift and friendly check in you have to go to a different bank of elevators to get to your room. This is a minor inconvenience at worst but is done for security. Rooms. We were on the 20th of 30 floors with a view mostly of construction and rooftop decks; there are some spectacular views but it was the Fourth of July weekend and none were available. Do ask about views, however. Some look right at the Freedom Tower. Worthy of special mention is the ""Downtown Living Room Bar & Terrace."" off the fifth floor which is an indoor year-round bar area but most notably has a wrap-around outdoor deck area, again with a spectacular view of the Freedom Tower and Monument. Ashley took great care of us on several visits. There is a restaurant on the first floor, the BLT Bar & Grill."" The food there is good but not rave quality and the bar area has sports-bar-style televisions where we watched USA dismantle Japan in the World Cup final.

The staff was extremely friendly and appealing to a more youthful demographic. The views are incredible at almost any angle of this hotel and you really don't miss much when you look out the window. On the down side the hotel is showing signs of age with some ripped carpet, broken drawers, misplaced light-ropes.

We had our two children (13 & 10) with us, so that was going to be a problem. The woman at reception was struggling with offering us a solution, when the manager, Katherine, came over and said she overheard our situation. She very graciously apologized and offered to select a corner, high floor room for us, and have featherbeds and extra comforters sent up if the kids did not mind sleeping on the floor.

This was my 3rd time visiting the city and 1st time staying downtown. The location of the hotel is perfect for those wanting to stay away from the craziness of midtown, but still close enough to other attractions like Battery Park, Wall Street, Little Italy and Chinatown and obviously the World Trade Center. I can not express enough how amazing the views of the Freedom Tower was. I happened to be there for my 26th birthday, and wanted to try things off the beaten path that only local New Yorkers would be familiar with. I could kick myself for not getting his name but the concierge on the night of May 30 was fantastic. He recommended a restaurant named Distilled in TriBeCa. He was nice enough to mention to the hostess that it was my birthday when he called to make our reservations. With that little mention, our waiter provided myself and my party with glasses of champagne and a birthday desert! The attention to detail at The W was above and beyond what I expected. I happen to work for this hotel company in New Orleans and I know that employees traveling often get overlooked because we are internal customers but that did not affect my service whatsoever. The concierge also took the time to book our Statue of Liberty passes and then have them delivered to our room while we were out and about in the city, making it so easy for us to get in everything we wanted in our short time.

The plan was to take her to San Antonio, Texas. I jump in and suggested to go to NY, and while we where there stay at W downtown. I used to work at W Mexico City and since then I’m in love with the brand, and what a better way to show the brand to my family than taking them to the city where the brand was born.I never expected that my little sister would be sleeping the first night, and the night of her birthday in a rolling bed.We arrived to W Downtown around 2:00 hrs. of Friday. First I was surprised by the attitude of the welcome desk agent. No eye contact, no smile, and no warm welcome nothing that is part of W DNA. Then he went to back office and came out with Michelle Chang, who I assume was the manager on duty or night manager.The first thing she told me was that the hotel was sold out and there was a problem, there weren’t any double bed rooms. This was since my reservation was made under a Starfriend rate. (She really meant that cause I reserved under this rate, they could just take away my room?) And then suggested that she could look up for a room in other hotel. (Again suggesting to separate my family apart). She was rude, and not understanding my situation witch was: Reservation was made on the 12/2/14, 3 rooms with king size bed.Confirmation of the double bedroom was received on the 12/03/14 (witch I sent you when asked at the hotel)I was fully charged for the rooms + taxes of the 3 rooms 1 month before my arrival.Michelle told me that there were no rooms until Sunday, after several minutes she told me that the next day they would be able to change the room as the one payed. The difference between rate of rooms was supposed to be adjusted in the final bill, thing that didn’t happened, I was told that they would reimburse the credit card that was used to pay. (still waiting for that to happen).Then Michel told me that they wouldn´t charge me for the rolling bed, (this is offensive, It was the least thing she could do)So, we went up to our rooms, and my surprise was that my room, and my brother`s room with was supposed to be a king size bed, we got queen bed in the smallest room I’ve ever seen.Next morning I went down and finally met 1 of the 2 kind people in the entire hotel. Katherine Woods. But at first with the same answer that Michel gave me, “there is nothing we can do for you” and after telling that I had the confirmation for that room, she showed that she was in my side and helped me. Also helped me to move to a better room, (paying for it) and finally get a King size bedroom.On Sunday we ordered IRD service, first I can tell the WW talent was so busy she was making us a favor becoming one more rude talent that we interact with. Dinner arrived to the room and when we tried to turn on the light… didn’t work, we called WW for someone to come up and fix it. Finally a nice man came and helped us. But when we tried to start our dinner, we noticed that we didn’t have a corkscrew in the room, and the IRD talent didn’t opened, so again we called WW to have someone sent up to open the bottle.At my check out we met another WD talent who, as the first one, didn’t talked to us, no eye contact, no nothing. Just “want you bill printed or by email”. And like that I left the hotel. No inquires of my stay, nothing.When we arrived to the airport I noticed that I left my passport at the hotel’s safe. I called and a WW talent transferred me to Security, I can say he was nice but didn’t go any further than that. I needed to call an UBER tell him the situation, ask him to go to the hotel, and then give the information to the security talent. The passports arrived on time to the airport, what surprised me is that no one in the hotel was willing to help me, and better a driver that I have never met before helped me than the staff of a hotel where I stayed.Overall I left the property unsatisfied. Sad of the way the Hotel manages the brand identity; the real DNA and the reason W Hotels are what they are in the market. W hotel don’t just sell rooms, they sell experiences, and yes, maybe for me one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had. You are the newest W Hotel in NY, but clearly you have lost your path. This was the 3th time I stayed @ W Downtown, and I’m sure the last one.","Mexico City, Mexico","Joselin G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mexico City, Mexico</strong>",25,2.0

I checked in with Tracy who was very helpful and accommodating, I informed her we were celebrating a special occasion and she helped me secure a room with a view! I inquired with the concierge, Henry?, regarding liquor stores and grocery stores nearby as I'm not familiar with the area; I am impressed with the follow up because not only did he give me directions but he sent a marked map up to my room. It's the small details that make an impression. Room- very clean, well appointed, wonderful huge windows with a lot of natural light, and the bed - SO comfortable. Location- very convenient. Within walking distance to a lot of sights and history that downtown has to offer. There are also many subway lines nearby so you are only minutes from anywhere in the city. Hotel: In general I think this is a great place to stay for younger groups/couples - ranging from 25-40. There is Happy Hour in the lobby bar and DJs, it's style and décor is definitely trendy and geared towards a crowd that is here to enjoy the nightlife the city has to offer. I wouldn't consider this a child friendly or family oriented hotel; not a bad thing- just informational for others doing their research.

I decided to book the W hotel because my girlfriend wanted to see the WTC memorial (Freedom Tower and Ground Zero) so why not right? I really love the design of the lobby; it has a really great and positive vibe. The staffs that were there was friendly and professional. I arrived in the hotel around 7am but the check-in time was at 3pm, lucky, the room I booked was available a little before noon. The room was really amazing; the view from the room was what you see in the lobby but much higher. The bed we had was really comfortable and the covers were the warmest covers I’ve ever slept on. The bathroom was interesting because one of the walls in the shower was a frosted glass wall; the other side is the bedside so you can really see the “outline” of the person. No complaint there. There is a fitness room and it was bigger than most hotels I’ve been in. There are around 3-4 treadmills and 2-3 stationary bikes. They do have dumbbells and it goes up to 50lbs, which is pretty good for a hotel. And they also have an incline/flat bench. One thing this hotel has that no other hotels really have is a cable machine that goes up to 100lbs. At nighttime, the lounge turns into a club. The lobby was dark, there was a live DJ and they have a bar. It’s a great opportunity to meet new people and have a few drinks after a tiring day. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay there. Even though it’s a bit pricey but you get what you paid for and it’s definitely a great experience. The staffs there were really professional and kind. The room was really modern.

Check in/check out was efficient and professional and I was delighted to receive a room upgrade, which came with a complimentary bottle of wine, and my room had an amazing view of Freedom Tiwer and Ground Zero. The area around the hotel is very quiet in the evenings, with very few sirens or ambulances to disturb your sleep. It's also only a block away from the 911 memorial and the NYPD are present throughout the area at all times, making late night walks feel safer. The lobby is not directly accessible to the street, as you take an elevator from street level to the check in area. As a W, it has a funky decor, and vibe, which I like, and most nights there is music and people mingling and hanging out in the lobby. If you opt to skip the hotel breakfast, Cafe De Novo is only two blocks away and opens very early (6am) for a fast take away/sit upstairs NY breakfast. You can join the construction workers who are picking up their friend egg sandwiches and buttered roles. The food is good and quick. One of my favorite things about this hotel is that you can catch the subway, which is within walking distance, for traveling to either the East and West side of Manhattan. Normally, I stay in mid-town which requires a long walk, a cab or shuttle at Times Square if I am traveling cross town. Here, it's not an issue. All in all, excellent stay, great service.

The standard room is small and shaped like an Aloft room - bed taking up most of the floor space and a narrow bathroom. The bed linens were crisp and clean, and I slept well. The bathroom linens, however, were frayed, spotty, and worn. The water pressure in the shower is great, and I got a nice hot shower before going to bed. In terms of decor, the bathroom has brown tiles which is tricky because unless every single crevice is super clean, the dust and dirt in corners show and makes for a messy appearance. The room carpet is also a dark brown shade and very easily shows where the corners and edges hadn't been vacuumed thoroughly.

Upon arrival we were met by lovely staff who checked us into our hotel room and took some details. We were offered to join the Starwood's hotel membership for free (sends you emails about hotel offers & you get membership points etc) I agreed and in return we got free wifi for the duration of our stay as well as two free drinks cards at the hotel bar! Definitely worth doing as you have to pay for wifi in the room otherwise. I'd read reviews that the hotel rooms were small which didn't bother me as we were in New York to be constantly out doing things not sitting in the room. In fact, when we arrived the rooms were a perfect size, the bathroom was well designed and spacious. I'd also read reviews the rooms were noisy, but both my boyfriend and I slept perfectly without a problem at all (This could have been due to the fact we were so busy during the day nothing would have been able to wake us up at night!) The bed was like a cloud to sleep on! The rooms were cleaned to a high standard daily and the bed was changed.On my boyfriend's birthday we came back to the room to a bottle of champagne and a crate of beers! Such a lovely touch. The atmosphere of the hotel was perfect, we had a group of friends come to meet us at our hotel before going out for dinner one evening. They were all impressed with the bar and ceiling in the lobby area! The drinks were quite expensive, but only what we were used to as we both work in London.The only downside was the location. I presume perfect for business as its located next to the finical district but for all the touristy bits I would have wanted to be more uptown. As this was my first time in New York I wasn't sure where would be a good place to stay. Having said that - we had no problem getting around! During the day, to get Uptown it only took about 15 mins on the subway. During the evening we got a cab to restaurants as I didn't fancy getting on the subway in high heels and a dress! Personal preference - the subway runs late into the night so never a problem getting around. Cab uptown costs roughly $15. There were always cabs parked up outside so we never had to wait. We didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to explore what New York had to offer. There's a lovely sports bar/diner next door! Also 100% recommend Keen's if you are looking for a special night out!Definitely would recommend this hotel 100 times over, so perfect for everything we were looking for.

It all combines for an effect that leaves you saying to yourself, ""I shouldn't be enjoying this as much as I am because I realize how over the top it is, but who the hell cares. This is fantastic."" First of all, the lobby is on the 5th floor (ground floor lobbies are SO old school. What are we, farmers?). As soon as you get out of the elevator to check in, you are a little blind because your eyes arent adjusted to the dark confines of the area. Luckily, the staff is super nice and is used to people getting off the elevator having no idea where they are going, so they call you over and get you all checked in. The staff was great. Checked in with keys in less than 5 min. We got a room on the 24th floor and it was fine. Not the most amazing view (we werent on the WTC side), but it certainly wasnt the worst. You had to pay a ridiculous amount for wi-fi (c'mon guys. Really?). The room was tiny, even by NYC standards. There was not enough room for us to have our luggage out on the floor and still be able walk around the bed. I am sure there are bigger rooms available (got this room the night before on a Priceline robbery), but this was humorous small. Honestly, I didnt care all that much because the bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. It ranks up there with some very high end properties. The look of the room is very Philippe Starck-esque. minimal and beautiful. The bathroom was also gorgeous and very edgy. Next to the insanely wonderful bed, the next best thing about this place is the location. Very easy to walk to the Brooklyn Bridge, Wall St, NYSE, Battery Park, Staten Island Ferry, WTC Memorial and all the other sites in the financial district. It also has a pretty easy escape route to LGA if you need to get to the airport. Not a ton of time fighting surface streets in Manhattan. It seems like half of all the subway lines funnel down around the bottom of the island and they are all 2-5 blocks around the hotel. Very easy to get around.Overall, this is a great property.

The pros: the hotel is very hip, very posh design with a cool bar area. Received fantastic service from front desk staff including some free drink coupons and a room upgrade (I am Platinum, though, so expected). The rooms are pretty roomy, and very funky but fun modern design. The corner rooms have really cool window seats, with the WTC view being pretty awesome. Also, the bed is spectacularly comfortable (not sure if it is a Westin Heavenly Bed, but it's as comfortable as HB or better). The ""Cons"" - the location is convenient if you are spending time in Lower Manhattan, but the exact location in Financial District isn't in the middle of much except for the WTC Memorial. It was a little tricky for cabs to get to the hotel due to construction and one-ways (though I didn't have a problem waiting for longer than 8-10 mins for an Uber). Ultimately, the hotel was about 30% more expensive than the Westin Times Square per night during the same weekend, and although I hate Times Square, the TSWQ Hotel is probably a better value for the price.

Such was not the case. On the labour day weekend the best we could do was $280 per night. The location was ideal for visiting all the sites we wanted. First impressions were good, the lobby was clean and stylish. On check-in I handed over my credit card and SPG gold card, hoping this would maybe get an upgrade. Nothing like that happened, so off to our first room. The room was on the seventh floor. The room was incredibly small. You walked in and two feet in the door you were beside the bed. There was enough room to walk around the bed and go to the bathroom. My wife was furious as the room quoted in the reservation was supposed to be 240 sq feet. That room was not even close. Back down to the lobby and my wife showed the paperwork for the reservation. The clerk said that we should have been put on the upper floors. Off we go again. This room was small as well but a little more space. I have attached photos of the view, if you are lucky ask for a north facing room. You would then have view of WTC memorial as well as the new world one tower. Facing west you don't have much to see. The room was clean and modern. You do hear noise from the hallways. I phoned down to confirm that Internet was included as I am SPG gold, alas since I had booked the hotel through Expedia I was not entitled to free internet. The price is$14.95 per day. However there about three free wifi signals you can get if you open the window. We had no problem accessing the internet. As well there is free internet on the fifth floor and as well a lot of the subway stations have free internet. There is no coffee maker in the room but between 6 am-8 am there was free coffee in the lobby. Or you could order coffee from room service for $20 plus delivery.

When you walk into building you have to get into an elevator and take it to the 5th floor to check in. On the fifth floor is checkin, outdoor balcony with seating and the bar/lounge which happens to be brand new and really a beautiful hip design. After check in we went up to our room. Nice room with a view of the new world trade center buildings (especially beautiful at night with all the lights).

And even if we HAD used it? How would the hotel know? We would've paid for our drinks and been on our merry way. In my opinion they add on this charge and I guarantee that many ppl who stay at this hotel do not even realize this BOGUS charge. SO beware and check your invoice before you leave the hotel!

There are better alternative options nearby: Marriott Downtown and Conrad by Hilton.

Not at all in this hotel as I experienced issues in 3 different ""Spectacular"" rooms. For example, if you set the AC on auto for 74 and the current temperature is 76, the fan would start as Low-Medium (which is normal). When the temperature gets closer to the target of 74, the fan suddenly jumps up to High (contrary to how a normal AC works) and continues for at least 20 minutes while you are freezing. Perhaps this issue only applies for the corner ""Spectacular"" rooms, but I would expect all rooms to have working ACs.","New York City, New York","982frankw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",8,2.0

Hop on and in 3 minutes you're in Chinatown (Canal St stop) or keep going uptown - both are West side of Manhattan train lines but R trains are easily switched to East (4,5,6) at 14th street. Personally, I like visiting Trinity's Church's 300 year old graveyard to see where Founding Father Alexander Hamilton rests (good July 4th activity, sorry abetr didn't know about that) or the Night before Christmas see Clement Moore - or just check out the old tombstone artwork. But you couldn't get me to visit Ground Zero for anything because it was incredibly painful to live through and to me it's...morbid. And jam packed. That said...it wouldn't have been our choice of location for a regular visit to Manhattan. W yes, but really it's a working area, kind of dirty, doesn't show the best of NY at all, and there's not much to do around the hotel. Not the fault of the hotel - but I'd say this is good for a Wall Street need, not a visitor stay.","North Kingstown, Rhode Island","Lisa C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Kingstown, Rhode Island</strong>",1,4.0

After miserably failing at the iPod/Auxiliary options even the radio failed to work. Eventually we ended up spending most of our evening in silence trying to figure out if we actually enjoyed each other's voices. In effort to break that silence we noticed that there was an ambiance machine located on the other side of the room. Our quick test promptly descended into a horror film when it started a human heartbeat 'ambiance' on full volume. But of course these are superficial points to the hotel's management. It must be noted that their staff is rather precise with their welcome mats. We noticed this upon checkout that we entered one elevator at 11:55 am and the elevator mat prominently displayed 'Good Morning.' Four minutes later we entered a separate elevator to find it saying 'Good Afternoon.' Now mind you... they were one minute early, but since we are relatively intelligent people, we figured that this was logistically understandable. Considering they have half a dozen elevator mats to change, and it simple doesn't make any sense to have the staff stop all their work and coordinate an immediate at noon changeover. But we certainly would have appreciated a bit more diligence.Nevertheless, the rooms are clean and pleasant, beds are soft, views are admiringly calm, location is excellent to get to either river (for fireworks) or the harbor, and most importantly the Brioche French Toast is simply delectably delicious.","New York City, New York","Kwan N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",6,4.0

One of the nice things about the W is you can count on their consistency- comfortable beds, great coffee in the morning and a beautiful hotel- all very true about the W in Downtown NYC. The only consideration of this hotel is the location- it sits right next to the beautiful and moving 911 memorial, however this also means there is a ton of tourists and a lot of construction going on. I really enjoyed looking out at the Freedom Tower and visiting the memorial and there's a great deck off the main floor where you can enjoy coffee or a cocktail and look out at the ongoing project and what's been built. It's also a great location to check out the Brooklyn Bridge.

Rooms are well done but like most in NYC are a bit smaller than you would see in other cities. The views of ground zero and the new Freedom Tower are excellent - especially on the upper floors. The hotel was totally sold out the nights I was there (which apparently occurs frequently), but it did not feel crowded, and the staff took the time to connect with you. It is very easy walking or jogging distance to Wall Street and to the tourist attractions in and around Battery Park. Although there are several good restaurants within walking distance, I ate breakfast at the hotel and found it to be very good. The food and service were both excellent although pricy for what you got (typical of most high end hotels). The atmosphere was a nice blend of adult social and business. While the downtown location is good, it is a pretty fair distance from the tourist machine of Times Square, and cab rides can take awhile if there is a lot of traffic. If Times Square and Midtown are your primary destination or if you are traveling with a group that is focusing on family activities, you might want to consider either a single night at this hotel or a more family focused hotel further north. The W Hotel staff is friendly and is genuinely interested in making sure things work well for you and that you want to come back. All in all - a good place to stay. I would come back if I was in the area.","Houston, Texas","clarktom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",51,4.0

Having been to New York before we enjoyed staying in this area and exploring somewhere more than in just a half day. The location was great and downtown has a lot to offer at Wall Street, Ground Zero and the shops down at pier 17 (particularly a large Abercrombie & Fitch that offers discounts the Fifth avenue flagship does not) However do bare in mind that if you plan to spend a lot of time going uptown to central park, Empire State, museums, broadway etc then taxis will be quite expensive. We found a cab up to fifth avenue was $20+ and to soho/TriBeCa $10. These aren't overly expensive per trip but across the whole visit dan amount to a couple of hundred dollars. I would recommend getting a week long subway pass/metro card for $30 (or less 3/5 day if your stay is shorter) This was great value we must have used it at least 5 times per day and considering we were told a return journey from downtown to the Met was $11, it does save you a lot, and you don't have to queue to reload your card each time.It saves you a lot of money and time on cabs as the subway is so quick and there are lots of stations near the hotel for the various different lines.We absolutely loved the hotel. It was gorgeously decorated and really modern and contemporary! The porters at the front of the hotel were super helpful with your bags, offering umbrellas and getting you cabs. They took our bags straight to our room and directed us to the front desk on the fifth floor.The reception area was lovely and combined with a lobby/bar area that also opened up to a gorgeous outdoor terrace bar area (which will be close due to inclement weather) the lobby was great and had free tea and coffee until ten am, a full bar with various bar snacks and appetisers. It also had free wifi which worked well.Our room was on the 20th floor and we had a corner room (which we paid for) it was very nice but looked out of the back of the hotel not on to ground zero which was a shame but the views were still fine.The room was a great size, lovely window seat, large comfortable bed and nice bathroom with shower.The room was cleaned perfectly each morning and we didn't have any issues with anything in the room apart from the WIFI.The wifi is not free (outside of the lobby) it is around $13 per day and we opted for a $70 package for 7days. The wifi was appalling, it rarely worked in our room and when it did it was slow and intermittent. The front desk were great they refunded the charge immediately and allowed us to keep the wifi on incase it worked.Overall we had a great stay, the location was fantastic, the hotel was gorgeous and we really enjoyed it.The hotel arranged us a car to Newark airport which was $100 (only $10 more than the cab we got on the way). If you are coming from Newark the cab ride is quite expensive so do account for that.","Manchester, United Kingdom","CAGW92MCR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",62,5.0

We did not even have to wait long at all for our vehicle to be retrieved from valet parking. Also, providing coffee, fruit, and healthy snacks for the guests the morning of the bike tour was a very nice touch.

Great option for friends, couples, or those traveling for business if you need to be in the Wall Street area.I always have a weird feeling about staying at a W, because it's the dance club version of a hotel, but if you can deal with that vibe it's a great option.

You enter on the street [where the big bar is located] then take the elevator up a few floors to the lobby, [which is not that uncommon in NYC].The lobby decor is 'way out there', very European in design, a very specific taste is almost required to enjoy the ambiance. A lot of European travelers stay there and their cell phone use is non stop. Sidewalk-bar-elevators-concierge line-free coffee line; there is no escape, even if you come down for your coffee at 7:02 am, they are calling home and shouting due to poor connections.A young US crowd stays there as well.A strange thing is that they have a rear set of elevators in the lobby for the 10 or 15 floors of private residences that occupy half the tower. The 'residents' have a definite 'owners attitude' toward the hotel 'riff-raff' and you have to share the lobby with them---not too pleasant.I am a Starwood Preferred and I love starwood but this hotel was just odd. The rooms were new eclectic and fancy, way back when, but now they are rather tired and dated. While you have a full view of the World Trade Center re-construction [25' across the street] it becomes a little depressing after a while. While I applaud the crowds that come to see the memorial, [as I have done myself, and it is worth it]; those crowds are just that, large crowds you have to deal with right out the front door on the hotel sidewalk, trying to walk around and competing for cabs.Sorry, but you should avoid this place, it was quite expensive $300+ per night and simply not worth it. If you 'need' to stay at a fancy WTC hotel; go a diagonal block over to the Millenium Hilton-a great place, fancy and updated with a cool bar, restaurant and a pool.","Boston, Massachusetts","Chasmyboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",3,3.0

I decided to use Priceline as it wasn't a crazy expensive time in NY and there seemed to be good options, this hotel came up in downtown, on Express deals, as 4.5 stars and at $164 that seemed great! After choosing that option I was informed it was the W downtown which I was really happy about. Flat rate to the city from JFK, so the Uber wasn't anymore or less expensive (taxi $45 plus tolls) uberX ($65 plus tolls) I got a driver with a Chysler 300.The great thing about this hotel is the Rector St subway stop is right around the corner, so getting uptown is very easy and only $2.50.My room on the 11th floor was not facing Freedom Tower, I would think those rooms would have been great. My room was exceptionally clean, the bed comfortable and the bathroom was a really good size, I loved it. And, there was something really nice about being away from the pulse of midtown.I would have rated it 5 stars but I ordered coffee to my room in the morning, the menu said $8 with the service charge it was $16, and, the first pot - it was a French press had really large chunks of coffee floating in it once I poured it, when I called the whatever/whenever the person said, that's just how a French press comes (I have one at home, mine certainly doesn't) anyway they said they would send another pot up, and that came quickly - great, but still chunks of coffee, the man who brought it up said he would try again, and he agreed, it shouldn't be like that, he would go and try again.... Which he did - mind you, I'm running out of time now, but he came back up, this time with a pot of drip coffee - on the plus side the service was great, the coffee in all cases was piping hot and the milk was cold, but I just didn't have a decent relaxing cup of coffee in the end as I had a meeting to get to. I haven't checked my bill yet, I really hope after all that they didn't charge me for it.I really would stay here again, I thought overall there were a lot of good things and that was a great price.","Alpharetta, Georgia","AnnetteT987</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alpharetta, Georgia</strong>",74,4.0

If this were a run-of-the-mill hotel in a suburb of any typical city, I would be content; however, this is neither. This is a W, in downtown New York City. The W line, at least to me, carries a certain weight; my expectations are automatically several levels above ""typical."" The first time in a W, generally, should be unique. And while there was certainly a good representation of New York inside, I didn't experience anything that I haven't found in lesser/cheaper hotels.

There are plenty of restaurants, stores and tourist attractions around.This has the vibe of other W properties, which means modern decor, loud lobby music at night and an upscale feel.

Our room had no maintenance issues, the bed was comfortable, the shower was great and the view from 9/11 memorial was fantastic. We used the connections panel provided for the TV and it worked perfectly, easy to set up and it was a welcome addition. One issue was that the walls were on the thin side, so we could sometimes hear the room next door.There is no free wi-fi in the room (which is always a drag), but at least there is access in the lobby (5th floor), which is more than I can say about some other properties. It's also nice to have water and coffee at the lobby as well.This would have been a clean review, but poor service cost the hotel one star. The staff was nice and efficient for routine tasks (check-in/out, housekeeping), but we had 2 issues during our 3-night stay of employees making no effort to be helpful (concierge and bell man), on simple requests that took 5 minutes for me to solve after I decided to do it myself.

One couch in the corner is set against the high-rise brick exterior, which provides a great photo opportunity. I did not get a chance to sample a cocktail, but the bartender kindly greeted me as I walked by.Room: Whereas the W in Union Square had a more serious look with their reptilian-skin textures, the W in Downtown reminded me a bit of South Beach, or the newly designed Tropicana in Vegas -- a glossy, white canvas with splashes of red. It gave a very cooling effect (which was probably more due to the a/c that had been turned up), and I liked it a lot on that very warm day. I enjoyed the view of the 1 WTC from my room.Verdict: A true ""W Hotel"" in terms of minimalist decor, but less of a see-and-be-seen vibe (there were plenty of families with kids in the lobby for a Sunday).

The only downside was there were no valets or doorman present when we got there? (I'm guessing it was because it was a Saturday night?) No big deal because we each had only 1 small bag each but you do expect that in NYC hotels or any city for that matter.

(In fact the price was less than a Holiday Inn on the Lower East Side!) It was my first time at this particular hotel and it was a wonderful experience. We arrived very early on a red eye and they let us check in - THANK YOU - AND upgraded us! The room was super comfortable. The lobby and bar area are comfy and chic. The staff was very nice. And while this has nothing to do with the hotel, I realized how EASY it is to stay downtown! This property is close to almost every subway making it easy to access all of the places we needed to go. Downtown is pretty quiet at night, which was fine with us, but bustling with tourists during the day which was nice. We recently moved away from NYC and our room overlooked the 9/11 memorial which is gorgeous and it was nice to be able to see it. It was a little strange that the bar - which gets busy with a DJ at night, thumping music, etc - also overlooks the memorial. All W's have an night time scene. I think people expect that from the brand. And there wasn't a noise issue because of it. It was just a bit peculiar as former New Yorkers to be in a disco atmosphere above the memorial. My only complaint is almost too small to mention but is enormously important to me - there was no coffee maker in the room. I am a caffeine addict and I NEED a cup of coffee in the morning. I appreciate that they have free coffee in the lobby but I don't want to get dressed to go down and get my morning coffee. Many boutique hotels don't supply a coffee maker. However, the equally chic W in downtown San Francisco had one so I was disappointed not to have one.

To be fair, each time an issue was reported, the front desk was apologetic and engineering was quick to arrive with the missing items. The desk was empowered to offer credit against in room dining charges and the hotel manager was able to offer Starwood points in exchange for the inconvenience. But with that said, when you're looking at nearly $1,000 for two night's stay these kinds of misses in succession can't happen. This stay was for business.

This was my first time at this particular property and I found it to be a very mediocre experience. The appearance of the lobby was very trendy and modern, and the rooms themselves are the same. But I also found the rooms to have fewer amenities than any of the other Starwood hotels I've stayed at. I was ""upgraded"" to a corner room at the back of the hotel that had some of the ugliest rooftop ""views"" I've ever seen. The problem with being in a corner room is that you get two walls of windows, and the blackout shades don't cover the gaps, so there's sun pouring into your room as soon as the sun starts to rise, and no way to make it darker. Additionally, as a platinum member, I'm used to amenities such as free water in the room (there was none) and being offered small courtesies upon checkin, but none of this happened. Small things like having zero plugs for phone chargers, etc beside the beds (either side, not even along the walls) puzzled me. Why have such a modern hotel but leave out such a crucial detail? The heating system was also not intuitive to use (and I'm not exactly lacking in brains, it just wasn't easy to use) and even just leaving the heat at one setting, first it would be very hot in the room and then it would be very cool. No consistent heating at all. Also, while I was very happy with having Bliss products in the bathroom, I had grabbed the lotion to take with me to the office and then left it there. Not a big deal, I presumed that housekeeping would have simply replaced it upon cleaning. They did not. None of the products, whether missing or having been significantly used, were replaced. Last, I was very disappointed to find that this hotel does not participate in the green program, allowing us to decline housekeeping for Starwood points. I generally prefer to do this at hotels, as I'm not messy and don't need someone in my room every day cleaning. Overall, I thought the hotel was fine, but for a price of almost $500/night, I certainly expected more amenities as a platinum member, and if they aren't given to their most frequent travelers, I can only imagine what the experience might be like for those who aren't frequent travelers. In the end, I don't see that there's any reason to actively avoid this hotel, but I also wouldn't recommend it. I think there are many better in the city, especially at that room price.","Salisbury, Maryland","angelaw919</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salisbury, Maryland</strong>",18,3.0

Chelsea was immediately attentive to my needs and understood the seriousness of the occasion while at the same time making me feel extremely excited about what we were planning. Not only did she have numerous recommendations for how to propose, she was more than available for questions, concerns, or anything at all. She even provided me with her personal number in order to make the proposal a true surprise, which it was! She even set up the room, and did it beautifully! I was so impressed, as was my fiance!

Generally speaking, W hotels are attractive for those seeking a hip, trendy, loungy, party kind of experience...but if you are seeking this, why are you downtown? It's a vacant no man's land. I have stayed at the W on Times Square, and that makes a bit more sense. As for the facilities themselves, the rooms are small, as expected, but chic, and the lounge area is upscale (but empty). The staff was OK...didn't seem to know that much about what was going on.

We first experienced W in Washington with its very cool vibe, and very friendly experience. Using priceline, we purchased our stay for the Canadian Thanksgiving/Columbus Day weekend. This W is easy to get to from LGA Airport (as any other destination in Manhattan) using the subway (via taxi to get to the subway - but I digress). Check in was longer than expected. This was not the hotel's fault since the gentleman in front of me had just under 1000 questions feeding our wait time. Thinking back, perhaps another associate could have been called to front desk check us in. Our room was a pleasant surprise of high level, spacious corner room. The corner room was a known, but the spaciousness of the ""cool corner room"" in Manhattan is a treat. This is a 3 year old hotel overlooking the 9-11 memorial. Probably the best view of the memorial in the immediate area (see pics below). All the furnishings are in perfect working condition and shape. The bathroom fixtures are also noticeably ""different"" which reminds you are at a the W. Soaps, shampoos, creams are excellent quality and worth ""grabbing a couple extra"". The bed was a comfortable queen with a duvet on top which added to it being comfortable. Pillow's a little too soft... different strokes, I guess.One pain in design - the reception and check in are located on the fifth floor. In order to get to your room, you had to take the elevator off street level, proceed to the fifth floor, navigate yourself through the lobby traffic and THEN get into another elevator to your suite. If you were in a bit of a rush, it would be frustrating. Thankfully the elevators are relatively quick.

I used a lot of credit card points and was highly disappointed. The hotel was slightly confusing to get into, as there are also residents who live there. The pictures of the lounges and bar area were a bit deceiving in appearance. We sat down at the bar during a slower time of the day, and were not helped for quite some time, in fact others who sat down after us were waited on first. We left our room before 9 one morning and had to ask them to clean it at 6 that night, as it had not been done. I realize this is New York and the hotel rooms are smaller than others, but I have stayed at a very nice hotel in the same area with much more bathroom space.

For two of the teens it was their first trip to NYC. One commented as she walked into the lobby, ""This is the nicest place I've ever stayed"". Again, coming from a 16-year old girl who is finicky about everything, I took this as quite a compliment. There is a very upbeat, contemporary flair to this place that made our stay here very comfortable. The rooms were nice sized, very clean, very updated and with all the comforts of home (and then some). The attached pic is a view from our room that was on the north side of the hotel giving us a view of the Freedom tower that was straight out of a NYC postcard - SPECTACULAR. The staff were all very accommodating, professional, sharp and fun. Close access to breakfast spots & subway system. You can park for Free on the Street a couple blocks away (on weekends) ~ major bonus since parking in NYC with a Large SUV would normally cost me $45 a day. The neighborhood was very safe (cops everywhere due to the fact that you are in very close proximity to the Freedom Tower/911 Memorial).

Walking into the lobby area by the elevators (the Living Room) was quite disorienting even in the afternoon, but we did get used to the lighting etc over time. DJ sets up shop right by the elevators in the evening, and music booms up the elevator shaft.Aside from that, we found that our room met Starwood's stringent standards. Room size was surprisingly large for NYC, very similar to standard Starwood rooms elsewhere. Bed was as comfortable as expected. Bathroom was spacious. BLISS products were fabulous. Window seat was a nice touch. View overlooking Freedom Tower was amazing.I had only 2 complaints for the room itself:(1) Lack of useful storage: close space would be fine for someone traveling solo; no dresser drawers or adequate place for toiletries etc in bathroom.(2) AC offers an automatic fan that typically cuts out at night. I always need a fan kept on low for white noise. So unfortunately we did hear our neighbouring guests.About the hotel itself, I do have to say that Reception is either poorly staffed or poorly managed. Often no one was at the desk and we typically had to wait a good 5 minutes for staff to appear. Equally bad @ check-out; ie one person @ Reception with a line of at least 5 guests. I'm glad we used express check-out! Concierge service was good.Exercise room was well equipped.Complimentary coffee/tea (very nice selection) available until 1000 AM in the Living Room.Terrace was amazing.WiFi and nice reading material available in the Living Room.We did not eat in the hotel, so cannot comment.Car service was accessible, and offered decent rates to the airport.Our housekeeper was amazing!!

I've read about them in the earlier reviews, so was not particularly surprised that it happened to me too. I didn't take anything from the minibar and yet, there they are on the final receipt! It's done in a really sneaky way - I didn't get the invoice while checking out, just heard that everything was fine and it would be emailed to me. Really surprising and has never happened to me in any other hotel.Other than that, it's a really nice hotel, with the ""W"" vibe, and I also liked the area (despite what some reviewers say) - it's a quick trip uptown by one of the express subway lines or a cab if you take the West End Hwy. Also walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge and then you're just minutes away from the lovely cafes/restaurants in DUMBO. All in all - a different perspective, especially if you're familiar with NY and want to try something new.

But it was in the right area and I had pretty well been able to discern that it would be the W...so I was happy with the results.We flew in to LaGuardia on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and grabbed the $27 dollar shuttle to downtown (more on that later). We got to the hotel before 11 a.m. and I had called ahead and they do have a place you can leave your bags if rooms aren't ready, but ours was. It was adorable...if not chic! Very small (as I understand is typical for downtown NYC hotels) but spacious enough. I mean, if you are going to NYC to stay in your hotel all day...um, why go? The bed is comfortable and there is a large desk/table that takes up the entire wall in front of the window...which allows for nice space to set things up. The bathroom is actually quite spacious and modern, with a glass shower. The door to the bathroom is a ""pocket door"" (that slides into the wall) and ours wanted to slide all the way open if opened slightly...and I got my fingers caught in it once...OUCH! Just be careful. The BLISS brand items in the bathroom were a wonderful highlight! There was bodywash, shampoo & conditioner, body butter, soap and even face wash! I kept these and took them with us on the cruise (which is what we were doing in NYC...leaving for a cruise the next day). Funny thing is on the cruise, the Celebrity spa also uses BLISS products and you could purchase a bag with almost the same things I had gotten from the W, same sizes and all, for $16. Ha! Thanks W! Our room was on what I would assume is the west side of the building, we were overlooking the WTC Memorial site line & gift shop, but not the memorial itself. My understanding from other reviews is it is a little quieter on the sides not facing construction but we had no issues with that where we were. This location is perfect for anyone looking to walk around NYC. We took in a lot, including the WTC Memorial, walked to Little Italy/Chinatown, SoHo and Greenwich, then hopped the subway to Central Park and took in a free outdoor concert at Lincoln Center. Hopped the subway back to downtown/financial district and it's just a few blocks walk to the W from the subway stops there (which was after midnight for us, so beware the trains that stop running that direction after certain hours). Apparently the W has a car service for free around downtown, but we didn't use it.Shuttle vs. Car Service: The W offers a car service, but when I called ahead and spoke to the concierge, he told me that it would be around $120 (he did try to sell me on the convenience...not having to be driven all around NY dropping people off at other hotels) it still didn't seem worth it to me. So the van/shuttle was just fine. 1) For $27 we got an easy ride around various parts of NYC (I took out my phone and followed along on my map so I could see some of what was around me) and 2) It didn't take but about an hour from the time we left the airport. We were the last on the shuttle van, but it was a nice/air conditioned ride and I was able to do some ""scoping"" of the city.","Ashland, KY","Cherrighost</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashland, KY</strong>",55,5.0

We stayed in a Spectacular Room over looking the 911 Memorial with adjoining room for the kids. The Spectacular rooms are quite large by NY standard and very comfortable. We did enjoy a drink in the BLT restaurant one evening at the bar, and it was nice. Another evening we sat on the terrace bar and had a bottle of wine. Our only real complaint is that the bar staff on the terrace are not very well trained and seem rather 'green'. Our wine was brought out with any type of chilling bucket - and we waited quite a while with a courtesy reminder to the waitress to bring one. No service was given as far as upsell for appetizers or anything like that - basically here is your bottle of wine - see ya. Doormen are 'ok' as well - again, a little green. Saw them many times hanging out in their little office/room. Cabs are VERY difficult at this property - and we were told by the doorman (who did help us get one) that you have to wait until another party drops off and that could be 25 minutes. This could be handled better for sure. who wants to wait - and hope - that a cab MAY come by. Other hotels have techniques that assure cabs - seemingly this one could too.We took advantage of the complimentary ride in the Acura, and it was very nice. They drove us to Chelsea Market, which was a nice treat not taking the subway or a cab - and it was free!My only 'warning' is watch out for internet usage. When we checked in - the desk person simple said that our password was our last name and room number. Great. No mention of charges or that the public area is free. SO - you can ONLY imagine our dismay as our son signed on with his PS Vita, our daughter with her iphone,and my husband with his ipad!! Each device - a separate daily rate of approx $15 plus tax. Luckily we caught it in time and the front desk assisted us on that matter.Our only 'issue' was Saturday night they had the DJ playing - music was QUITE loud.

There is NO WAY - especially if you were on floors below 11th (bar is on 5th) that you WOULDNT hear it!

I was woken up by an incredible racket at 5am, a racket which went on a long time. (I wound up checking out early). I called the front desk and was offered a breakfast credit, which I accepted. Four hours later I went down to see the manager, who was very sympathetic. (And reduced the price of the room.) So, staff is helpful, rooms very comfortable and well-kept. Many streets are still closed because of the terrible storm (Sandy) so the area is difficult to navigate and there were many tourists.There's a lack of reasonably-priced restaurants. On the other hand, it's a great hotel.

It is located adjacent to the World Trade Center site where the Freedom Tower is now being built. This represents quite a dramatic backdrop to the hotel. The drama continues as you step out of the elevator to the 5th floor lobby. I arrived at night and the reflection of the neon, undulating ceiling on the black marble floor was impressive. It was a Monday night so the lobby bar was not too full, but it did look inviting. Check-in was quick and I headed off to my 20th floor room. Two things struck me as I entered. The AC was on full blast so it was freezing in the room. The second, was the size. The room was $300 / night (on my company's discount, no less) and it was tiny. There was barely enough space for me to open my rollerbag. However, the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower (with the Bliss amenities) was great in the morning. Most importantly, it was very quiet and the din of the city did not disrupt my sleep. Overall, I would happily try the W Downtown again for a business trip, but probably upgrade to a larger room.

Despite there being lots of space in the bathroom, the shower and sink area were tiny! There aren't much space for you to put anything.What really shined at this hotel was the service and attitude of the concierge, particularly Nicole (?).

We have stayed at several different hotels in several different locations throughout Manhattan. At our last stay in the city, we had admired the looks of the the W Downtown from our room in another neighboring hotel we had been staying in.So for my birthday we decided to book our stay at W Downtown. Our check-in was speedy and the staff friendly. The hotel was very trendy and almost futuristic looking. It was neat, but not usually what I would go for. Our room was clean and plenty well stocked with lots of little things that you could buy. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom, was nice, but no bathtub, the lighting in the room was TERRIBLE!!! There was not enough of it and what was in there kept flickering and was dim. Plus they charge for everything and the prices are high and no free wi-fii.The crowd that was staying the hotel seemed to be a younger crowd (my husband and I are in our 40's). There was a couple of young boys there skating around on roller blades and some with skateboards. This seemed odd to me because I thought it was more of a business hotel.Room service was good and the food delish. I caution you however, to be very careful when ordering from the breakfast door hanger. It is very misleading. We ordered our breakfast from it the 1st night we stayed and when it arrived the next morning, they double charged us for everything ($90.00) for a breakfast ($12.00 for coffee, $6.00 per cup for juice, our breakfast $41.00). The door hanger made it appear as if the coffee and the juice was included with the 2 breakfast dishes we had ordered. Plus there was lots of extra taxes, room delivery fees, services charges, etc. When I had called to speak to someone about this and get a copy of my bill, it took almost 6 hours before I had gotten it resolved and numerous phone calls. The manager, Courtney I think her name was, was very nice and eager to please. She immediately fixed the bill and sent a copy up to our room. I was grateful for her.I was also disappointed with the Acura service that they offer. 2 nights in a row I tried to book it to get to our evening events and was told both nights that they were booked. The 2nd day I called by 9 am for 5 pm that night. He told me they only have 2 cars for 200 rooms and they book up quick. Perhaps if you're going to offer a service for that many rooms, you should have more cars. I was very annoyed with this.We had a very nice man visit our room from engineering as we couldn't figure out how to open the fridge. He was very nice and helpful. That is the the biggest plus of W Downtown.........the staff were all very friendly.On the day after my birthday they did send up a card, a peice of cake and 2 bottles of water to our room. I thought this was very nice.All in all, for what you pay and what you get, I much rather prefer the Bryant Park Hotel or Marriot Downtown. I probably wouldn't stay here again.","Waterford, Connecticut, USA","michellemayo07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waterford, Connecticut, USA</strong>",53,3.0

TrendinessI've not stayed in a W Hotel before so this may be reflective of the brand rather than thin particular hotel but I'd found it tried way too hard to be modern and hip, yet missed the mark. I'm talking about little touches like placards saying things like ""have a bite"" that was placed beside snacks near the mini bar. When I saw this my impression was originally ""oh wow that's nice"" and then I realized there's a menu and it shows you how much you have to pay. There's lots of these little placards around and I didn't see the point of them....2. Nothing is freeOk ok... Put out peanuts, chocolates, biscuits whatever.... But those little placards telling you to eat them or drink them or use them.... Then showing the price of them, hmmm. There's even a price displayed for the umbrella amongst other things. And why is breakfast not complimentary? Ditto wifi?!3. LocationGood for business... Not a great hotspot for tourists other than battery park, world trade centre and Wall Street which I think is easily achievable and better if you stay somewhere else and visit as a Half day trip.4. Room sizeLastly.... The room size was tiny, rivaling the hotels I've stayed in Paris for space at a premium.

The pros: -Decent sized room for New York. -pretty nice views because the hotel is on high levels- swanky atmosphere and bar area typical of any W hotel I've encountered-the bathroom was small but made of leather which was very different and kind of cool to seeThe cons: -Even with a do not disturb sign on we were disturbed 3 times! What's the point of the sign if housekeeping and the mini bar checkers do not respect it?! -at check in there were three people at the desk but only one working. So we had to queue up in a long line with our heavy bags before being helped. I don't understand why everyone who works there is so inept and unhelpful. - in the middle of the night there was some sort of alarm - so I called the front desk and they said they were aware of it and it would be taken care of soon. It wasn't for over an hour until like 4am. Unacceptable. -the elevators are really noisy and almost every room on every possible floor centers around them. So you constantly hear the noise from guests waiting for the elevator as well as the noise from the machine. -location is subpar if you're looking for a convenient place to experience what NYC has to offerWe will not be back. ,"New York City, New York","luxurylover86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",72,1.0

Second time round, the wonderful team at the W did not disappoint. We were checked in by JaVonn who was very friendly, got to the room, which was impeccably presented, clean, bright and with a great view of the memorial. We had some 'Wheels' booked for later (the hotel's complimentary guest drop off service) but were told when we arrived for the reservation that the Acura was stuck in traffic and our reservation could not be honoured. 7PM on a friday in Manhattan is pretty sketchy anyway, but how would we make our reservation for dinner with no way to get there? This is where the team really shined...they apologised and offered to pick up the tab for our cabs there and back (i don't think this happens often but who am i to say?), and were very amicable when we returned to the W living room, chatting with us and making us feel very welcome. Upon return to the room, a little set of gifts was waiting on the table with a lovely handwritten note from Chelsea.you made our Manhattan night out all the more special and memorable, and the team at this W need to be recognised for their professional, discrete fun and friendly approach - a great example of what customer service should be. They really did go 'above and beyond' my already high expectations I have come to get from W Hotels. I will definitely be staying again when i return! The only thing i would say was that i enjoy the W living room DJ mixers, they come up with some very unique and atmospheric beats (Check their app!), but the DJ on that night didn't seem to be playing regular songs instead of being a bit different and original.

Given that we shared the cost, it made it a little more affordable for me so I was happy that we were able to secure a reservation. The location was great for us, close to a store that we wanted to check out and walking distance to other locations like Battery Park City, Wall St., Trinity Church, etc. We had a great view of the 9/11 Memorial and it was stunning and shocking to see this up close and realize that it wasn't a dream at all, it had actually happened. The room was quite spacious given that it's NYC and real estate is at a premium. The concierge and hotel staff were all wonderful. The bed was amazingly comfortable! I liked the added touch of free coffee in the club/lounge area next to the check-in desks - while we had a coffeemaker in our room, the coffee was better in the lounge.

The lobby and bar are on the 5th floor which is differenct but the service of the bell and front desk were excellent. The bed and pillows are definitely good which is the main thing i care about when staying at a hotel. The rooms are small but that is normal for a new york hotel. The annoying thing for me was the lack of plugs (none actually) next to my bed to plug my blackberry/alarm. The plugs for the lights and alarm were built into the furniture and you couldn't unplug them to even put in your own. So i would say the hotel is average. Adding the plugs would have made it one rating higher for me.

Free coffee service in the morning, and excellent concierge staff, particularly Nicole. Only minor complaint is that sometimes the modern design theme is taken too far - hard to find on/off buttons on table lamps, and would also note that the frosted glass 'peek a boo' panel on the shower area also allows one to see you while utilizing the toilet, so be aware of that if you are staying in the room with another person.

(All of the other hotels in the area were closed as well.) The W website had a directly email for information and the general manager assured me that they would be open to welcome me. I arrived on what was their first day open after cleaning up after the storm and I have to say that they really had their operation going full-speed-ahead. I was greeted warmy by doormen/bellmen and registration was a breeze. I was in room 2107 without delay.My room faced north and I looked upon the WTC/Freedom Town/9-11 Memorial site (see pics). By NYC standards the room was pretty roomy (if you've stayed in NYC before you know that even pricey hotels often have smaller than average rooms). The bed, as always, is comfortable and the design is very modern: zebra-pattern carpets, lizard-skin pattern bathroom tiles; it's just really cool interior design. Oh, bar area is really nice too, a number of my friends met up in the ""Livingroom Bar"" and had several rounds before dinner.The bathroom is very bright and minimalist with a pocket door. Although I liked the bathroom, I think that someone with a lot of toiletries would be frustrated wtih the lack of counter space around the vanity. My room had no tub, just a glass enclosed shower stall with a frosted-glass wall separating the shower from the room.A bottle of water is provided and a welcome box of small salted gourmet toffee. Robe, iron, hair dryer, and safe are all there. They also offer the Acura Experience but you must plan ahead a bit.My only complaint is that my room was near the ice machine and what I think was a service door because I could hear the ice maker motor running from time to time and once at 3:10 a.m. a maintenance worker's press-to-talk phone volume while in the hallway was so loud that it woke me up.I read others' reviews that complained about the entry/lobby/bell stand but I don't see what the problem is. I was greeted warmly and directed to take the elevator up to registration. Baggage hold is at the ground level so make it when you need to leave. Also, although I was facing the WTC construction site, I didn't have a problem sleeping to 9:00 a.m. every morning; yes, there was construction noise but it's NYC and there is always gong to be some noise. If guess if you're a really light sleeper, try a room facing south.Kudos to the staff for getting things up and running so quickly while all of the other hotels in the immediate area were still recovering from the storm.

The design of the rooms is stylish, but the color palette they use is uninspiring. It is basically all white, all the time. The size of the room certainly did not justify the premium over a regular room.Unfortunately we also had one of the housekeeping staff enter our room about 2 hours before we were due to check out. This wouldn't have been an issue if not for the fact that she asked us directly when we stopped her from entering ""When are you leaving?"".

The rector stop is the next closest and the WTC subway stop is reasonably close too. The entire area has construction going on and hence subway is the easiest mode of transport and cab access needs a short walk too.Decor - I stayed for couple of nights in late Jan.

The hotel has a trendy vibe as can be seen from the photographs at the hotel website. Weekend there is a DJ playing music in the bar lounge on the 5th floor and was quite a nice environment.Room - The room is quite clean but is reasonably small. The interesting architectural design to improve the space occupancy in manhattan is to have all the rooms having windows on at least one side. It had a nice comfortable bed, working table, refrigerator, 42 inch flat tv and a shelf having storage space along with a combination lock.Bath - The bath was quite spacious and was excellently furnished and had bliss bath products. The water pressure was slightly on the lower side but was quite acceptable. There were couple of bath robes which were very comfortable.Internet - The Internet access is free only in the lobby and needs to be purchased.Food - I did not try the food menu in the hotel and there is a BLT restaurant in the ground floor.Summary - The hotel provided a decent rate in off season time of Jan (around $150).

I was in room 1113 which is directly opposite 1112 on a side from the elevator. It would appear that the previous occupants of 1112 had set their alarm for 7am and when the room was vacated no one had thought to reset the alarm, I tried to ignore the noise for some time before I rang reception to ask if they could go in and stop the alarm, I thought this would happen fairly quickly unfortunately it took another phone call at 7.50am after the alarm had been going for nearly an hour for Sabrina to get someone to come and stop the alarm. Not good enough.It would appear there is a problem in the turnover/change of the rooms as our toilet did not work either however I felt that I didn't want to raise this as well as the alarm straight away so my partner called down and said could this be fixed during the day whilst we were out.

I must say, compared to the W on Lexington, this W fared much better in just about all aspects. Perhaps unfair to compare, but that’s what we’re suppose to do, right?The décor of the common areas was much more modern and well-kept. The doormen polite, accommodating (especially Christopher!) and available. Couldn’t recall seeing any doormen at the Lexington location, come to think of it. The room was actually roomy, well laid-out, with lots of window seating which doubled as luggage rack and shelf for assorted stuff one casts about during travels. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows not too funky smelling. The bathroom was done in faux leather-look small tiles in chocolate brown, paired with grey striped large tiles, creating a visual and textural contrast that is really quite sophisticated. The A/C unit was a bit noisier than white noise, and the vent blows air quite forcefully across the room. Had to turn the system off in order to sleep undisturbed. The hotel is across from the Memorial site, which is still heavily under construction, so street noise starts early and definitely audible even through the insulated windows. My husband said that some rooms have a noise-cancelling device that plays different soothing sounds. Not in this one though.Complimentary scalding hot, strong coffee and tea are available every morning at the bar area off to the right of the elevators on the 5th floor, a much-needed and welcomed perk. The Sweat gym on the 3rd floor is smallish, but outfitted to take care of your every needs. The machines are easy to use, and there are towels (wet or dry), scented Bliss facial wipes, disposable ear buds, cold bottled water in fridge or water cooler, newspapers, magazines and green apples available to make your workout pleasant and complete. This W is right across the street from the Memorial, so it is a easy jaunt over to the building where you can pick up timed, free ticket(s) to go through the Memorial at your own pace. You do, however, have to go through a security scan, remove jackets and assorted equipment, and show the ticket to about a dozen people before you enter the serene grounds of the Memorial. It is worth the pilgrimage, just to reflect and meditate within such peaceful surrounds, upon a site devastated by so much hatred and violence.The W Downtown is definitely a hotel I’d return to and recommend for others to stay at.","Toronto, Canada","msmew8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",69,5.0

I'm talking about the time it takes to swipe a card and make a photocopy. Ok fine, no biggie. I can let it slide. BUT, when you go to your room and discover that the toilet isn't clean, that's where I draw the line. This is really a category 6? Come on Starwood, you can do better than that. I called the front desk to let them know and they volunteered to clean it right away but I said hold off (this was late at night) and do it the following day. The following day, when someone was supposed to be sent right up to call, that took 35-40 minutes. If you sent a guest to a room with a dirty bathroom, there should be someone waiting outside my door jumping to clean it. What really makes me angry though is that I told the front desk that I wanted the manager alerted of this. I'm not a picky traveler and I don't ask for much. Efficiency at check-in/check-out and a clean room should not be too much to ask for. If you don't provide that, the hotel should be compensating me for a lot (at least a hotel of this supposed caliber). But, no manager called to apologize let alone compensate me for anything. The W gyms in general suck and the layout is very inconvenient because it's 2 elevators to get to your room. Totally impractical. Also, I got upgrade to a King room with a view that's about 5 feet from the elevator. You can hear the elevator beeps, which I really don't enjoy. I think the Westin hotels are much better. But the dirty bathroom was the beginning of the end for this W Downtown. Starwood needs to re-think this hotel or the manager needs to wake up.","New York City, New York","cobra_commander</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",35,1.0

Any time I call the hotel, call starwood, or do an online chat with starwood, I am given different information, usually conflicting, with varying degrees of friendliness. I think the people that work in these different areas are confused, and it is obvious. Part of the problem is that when you try and book a room through the W website, starwood website, or starwood ap (calling the hotel directly seems to get a less desired rate) there are different packages available. So my overall advice with Starwood is shop around their different various websites and don't take one person's word for it when they tell you something. I was told by multiple people my room was prepaid and could not be changed, even though my confirmation said otherwise. In the end, I had no problem making those changes, but i wish i didn't have to go through the hassle. Some of this is relevant to my stay at the W, because the front desk person did not understand the package that was booked, and then when I got my invoice, I had to call and go back to the front desk to get the charges taken off. This is really a minor inconvenience but it goes back to my earlier point of general ignorance so I am sure it happens on a systematic basis. That said, they fixed my bill, but why deal with this at a luxury hotel brand? A wise man once said "" details, gentlemen"" they really do matter.Ok, on to the hotel, I felt that I got good value, package included a couple drinks and an Amex gift card. The room was REALLY small....I am local, so I get the whole NY real estate thing, but cool corner is advertised as >300 sq ft. My first NYC apartment was 600 square feet, so I'm calling BS on that...other than that, the bed was super comfortable, the shower was great, nice bathrobes, and it was a nice room. Living room bartender Trevor was friendly as all staff we encountered were. The location is a little weird, I mean, its FiDi, so there is easy access to Tribeca/SoHo and battery park. I noticed alot of out of towners love it there because of the whole world trade center thing which seems really bizarre. I didn't want to stay in midtown, and because of the close proximity to downtown neighborhoods, and the room rate, can't really complain about the location.I was there for one night with my wife as a night away from our daughter for my birthday, so the size of the room was pretty inconsequential. I am not sure how expensive the room would have to get in order to be large enough to accommodate families, although I always find it strange when families stay at W's--they are not really geared towards families (i know every W hotel manager would probably dispute that though)It has an ok gym too, workable to get a little done while you are there, but it is more of an afterthought.Overall, be aware of the location and if its what you want. The rooms are great, but very small.Friendly and professional staff. Very reasonable prices for NYC (even considering the room size) If you have business in FiDi, its probably a good place to stay, although might be worth checking out the prices at the Ritz too. I would stay again with my wife, but if I were to come back with kids, I think i would want to stay more uptown.","New York City, New York","adambr14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",14,3.0

Its so out of the way that their bar/lounge is never packed you will get a smattering of after work crowd but it peters out after 8pm.So all in all this hotel is to be avoided not a W by any measure.","New York City, New York","wysiwyg25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",15,2.0

However, if I am to pay for a 4.5* hotel, I expect a bit more. The staff at recption was friendly and efficient. The rooms are well appointed but small. As I have a young child, I was annoyed that much of the shelf space in the room is taken up by the stuff for sale that was also within reach of my child. When I requested they be removed to afford more space in the room and less of an attractive nusiance, I was told there would be a $35 charge to do so. The room was mostly clean but a room needs to be FULLY clean. My child was playing on the floor and found a full vial of some type of single dose drug. When I brought it the front desk I was thanked for it. NOTHING FURTHER WAS DONE. Had I not seen my child pull up the mystery vial, I may have been taking a trip to the hospital. THIS REQUIRES MORE THAN A THANK YOU. Had the rooms been properly cleaned, I may have been more impressed with the rest of the place and less upset about the staff's inability to cope with a very upsetting customer experience but..... I might stay here again, but would never pay the standard rate as it is not worth the price. I question the current 4.5* rating. I stay in NYCa great number of nights each year and have had better experiences at a number of other less expensive alternatives.

The hotel faces the entrance to the memorial and be sure to sip at the lobby bar or even better, the outdoor balcony for a superb view of One WTC and the other upcoming WTC towers. Inspite of the the on going construction (which doesn't really bother me) the area is bustling with tourist and within minutes of Soho and lower east side. The WTC subway station is minutes away nearby century 21, or the Lexington line is a couple of blocks on broadway. The 5 th floor lobby is ideal and feels isolated from the main tourist traffic and 9/11 memorial crowd, unlike the other nearby hotels. The wonderful/spectacular rooms are fairly designed and seems normal with enclosed bathroom unlike some of the other Ws. We had a corner room facing south east. The service is just about average and somewhat 'cold' at the front desk, but that didn't really bother me since I'm not a high demanding guest and don't expect too much in terms of service and attention. However, some may find it to be rude and unattentive. At night, ther area tend to be on a quiet side after the memorial closes. Nevertheless, you could gawk at the brightly lighted 1WTC tower from the lobby bar balcony. The lobby has a good selection of costly drinks and nibbles. we we fortunate to have a package deal which offered complimentary drinks. Heading out to nearby soho is about a 15-20 min walk or a short subway ride. I give this 5* Just for the location and property but 4 * for the service. Would consider staying here again when in NYC.

Much appreciated. I went to the concierge to ask about arranging a car to the airport since we had so much luggage...after I was ignored, she rudely answered it would be $120 to the airport! SERIOUSLY? Overall, any time I asked for something, I felt like I was a MAJOR INCONVENIENCE! We rented a car for one night and parked at the hotel, upon check out I find that I have been charged for parking on all 3 nights!! Then the girl at the desk was trying to argue with me telling me that according to her computer I parked my car there all 3 nights...How is that possible when I only rented the car for one night???? Do you want to see my rental agreement????? Eventually, after a bit of arguing, she removed the 2 extra charges. I have no problem paying for the service used, but don't try to charge me for something I didn't use! And don't argue with me about it either!! I definitely WILL NOT be staying here again and will let my friends know not to, either! One redeeming moment...the girl working the front desk gave us great instructions on riding the train out to Citi Field for the Mets game!

The room was very comfortable, a good size and the cushions in the large windows were great for sitting and catching the views (although it was rainy that night). The bathroom is very large, but the shower has a very soft water spray and it takes some time to completely soap off if you are used to a stronger shower head.Because I had such a long day and because of the storm, I did not go down to the lounge or balcony bar, but this appeared to be a lively and fun hotel and I could envision some good entertainment for happy hours and late night. I ordered room service for dinner and it is a bit pricey. The burger was cooked to order but the meat had been heavily salted for some reason; almost inedible. I had breakfast the next morning in BLT bar and grill; decent and filling but I noticed that my bill was double-charged at checkout, so I am contacting them to follow up on that.I would definitely like to stay at this W again and take in more of its amenities, but it is very much the lower Manhattan neighborhood experience and there is a tourist crowd around going to the WTC memorial and other sites.

The entrance is not very welcoming as it is essentially some double doors and a lift! Things get better when you get up to the reception where there is a cool vibe and funky decor. Rooms are very clean and comfortable with all expected amenities including a great shower. Not everything is perfect though as the ironing board was useless and the aircon was like an uncontrollable stallion - occasionally galloping off in the middle of the night and generally difficult to control. The surrounding area is still a bit short of great places to eat but these will come in time. Wifi was included in my tariff but beware if it's not as you seem to be paying for each appliance. In conclusion it's an interesting hotel but there are probably better ones elsewhere downtown for the price. ,,Yangrima,11,4.0

The location was close to several subway lines and there were plenty of places to grab a quick breakfast in the morning. It's also right across the street from the 9-11 Memorial Site so that was convenient for taking the tour.

The employees were friendly, rooms were stylish (as usual) and the hotel was very clean. Location-wise, this hotel worked well for us as most of our activities were in the downtown area, but it was pretty far down and for a tourist, it might be more practical to stay closer to Soho or Tribeca near good shops and restaurants. Walking around the construction to get to the subway stops was kind of a hassle.Speaking of construction, the noise was a non-issue for us and we were right in front looking down on the site. I was worried we might wake up to the sound of jackhammers, but it didn't happen. What we did wake up to was the sound of our neighbors turning on their TV at 3:30 AM. I think they had a baby who wouldn't go to sleep and were trying to drown out the baby with the TV. I was never able to gauge whether they had the TV very loud or if the walls were just really thin, but that part of the stay was unpleasant. The other concern was that The W would feel like hipsterville. Not the case. There was a perfect mix of trendy people, tourists and business types, so we felt right at home.","Chicago, Illinois","Annagins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",47,4.0

We wanted to stay in the Tribeca/Financial District and after searching for and reading the reviews for hotels in the area, we decided on the W New York (Downtown). In a word - Outstanding! Because of the reconstruction of the buildings in and around ground zero, there is a bit of a challenge to get to the front door, but once there, we were very happy with our choice. We were whisked up to the fifth floor for our check-in and Andrew (at the front desk) was very helpful to us. Check-in (for our two adjoining rooms) was a pleasure and a breeze. He explained the services and facilities and answered all of our questions. The bellhop brought us to our room, explained everything to us (including how to adjust the A/C) and left us with a smile.The room was clean (some scuffs on the white walls that could use a bit of touch-up though), well sized and the bathroom was larger than we thought it would be. Well stocked snacks and bar (if you wanted to indulge) and a bed that was probably the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. Our room faced the construction site and we could see the Empire State Building in the distance.It's the little things that would make us to want to come back. VERY good coffee served in the lobby every morning (which was replaced by iced lemon/lime water during the rest of the day) and floor mats in the elevator that were changed every 8 hours that read ""GOOD MORNING"", ""GOOD AFTERNOON"" and ""GOOD EVENING"". Simple, but impressive.The location is great. A few blocks away from Wall Street, Battery Park, the river, Century 21, and a few subway lines.

During our three-day visit, a doorman was only in the lobby one time to get a taxi for us. I also had called the hotel to make certain that the room came with Internet access.

It was a very pleasant stay - while we booked online through a third party website, they still honored my SPG gold status, which was nice and we received an upgraded room.The upgrade came with the caveat that it was facing the World Trade Center construction site, so there might be some additional noise. We were open to it, however, because it sounded interesting, and while there was a constant stream of construction it was generally quiet in the evening. I think getting a birds-eye view of the site was one of the most interesting things about the stay, so unless you sleep during the day a lot, it's worth experiencing.The check-in is on the 5th floor, so you have to take an elevator up to reach the proper lobby. The lobby has a bar, which is open in the afternoon/evenings, a good spot to catch a drink before heading out. The drinks aren't cheap, but the pours tended to be generous. The room itself was well appointed - the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a nice shower, and my wife was quite happy with the bath products offered. As we did have a slightly larger room, I was disappointed that there was no sitting area or at least a lounger chair to relax in. It seems all the rooms have ""sitting"" areas on the window ledge, and part of the built in furniture, but they weren't really comfortable to sit on. To each their own.The hotel restaurant was the BLT Bar and Grill - it was quite good, and a nice perk. We had the burgers and some other munchies and they were all excellent. It seems to have a great after work scene - bit crowded, but very lively. I'm a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews of the food and staff - we had a good experience and I like to think we're experienced diners.The service at the hotel - in particular the doormen and the floaters - was excellent. Normally I wouldn't mention it, but in this case they did seem to go above and beyond, which really improved our stay. Some of our group members needed some additional assistance and the staff here did an exceptional job of assisting with cabs and arranging transport. I would recommend this hotel - it is good value for NYC and especially well located if ground zero is an important part of your trip. As a point of reference, we've recently stayed at the Hotel Andaz on Wall street and the Omni Berkshire around mid-town. This hotel compares well with those others - with a definite edge in service to the W if that is important to you. The rooms at the W appear to be slightly smaller. The Andaz has the free soft drinks and munchies, but the service was poorer.

We chose this hotel due to its downtown location as we didn't want to stay midtown. The location for us is excellent, near to little Italy, soho, battery park etc. It is minutes from several subway stations so has excellent access to many lines.The rooms were very nice with lovely bathrooms. Yes there was dust on the mini bar items as other people have said. The Bliss toiletries smelt nice but really dried out our skin so take care. The beds are amazing and we slept very well indeed.Tip - book through Hotwire for good deals.We would definitely stay here again and recommend to people who want a great downtown location.","Stockport, United Kingdom","nathsal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockport, United Kingdom</strong>",101,4.0

I booked the hotel on sale so it was a decent price for NYC. I've listed the pros vs cons of this hotel below:Pros:- Decently close to a major subway stop (Rector) which has access to good line that takes you into the central part of the city.- Duane Reade and a small convenience store (Joe's Gourmet) is reasonably close by to pick up water and such. - Easy access to Taxi (via intersection of the hotel) or via the doorman in the front of the hotel. - Modern decor inside and very clean. - LOVE the Bliss toiletries. No need to bring your own favourite ones b/c this one is high quality (Also sold in Sephora and it's not cheap)- washroom was nice and modern. The shower area was quite roomy. - Front desk was very friendly.Cons:- Construction noise outside (rebuilding of the WTO site) is VERY loud in the morning. You have to use earplugs, or else you will be awake quite early. - We were told that the ""double beds"" room was sold out (first time it ever happened to me that a hotel told me this --i guess i have been lucky with my hotels until NOW). Front desk man squeezed 4 girls into a corner unit with a king sized bed and a rollaway bed. I mean, he was nice about it but we did not pay like almost $300 to sleep on an uncomfortable rollaway bed for 1 night each. was VERY disappointed with this. Also, their ""corner unit"" large room was not large at all. But this is prob b/c of the size of all NYC hotels. - location was definitely not the most convenient if you are there to shop (not sight see).- on the last day of our stay, the wind was so strong in NYC that it blew our 19th floor window open (approx 25 degrees in angle). Mind you, you can sit on the ledge (cushioned ledge couch style windows) so imagine if someone was actually sitting and leaning on the ledge/window at the the time the window all of a sudden gave in ""by itself""... getting shivers thinking about this. Overall, the was a decent stay but I don't feel the need to go back to W, considering that there are a lot of hotel options in NYC.","Toronto, Canada","LDV15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",45,3.0

As characteristic with some of the other W hotels (Times Square, for example), the lobby is on an upper floor, so that helps getting and out of the hotel (not having to worry about the traffic on the ground level). Note that the hotel is directly facing the Ground Zero construction and visitor sites, so it can be a little messy, crowded and noisy. That said, the hotel is nice and clean with good amenities. I wouldn't recommend the hotel for families, but then that isn't traditionally the market for the W hotel chain.","Toronto, Canada","Chris B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",81,4.0

We booked on Hotwire and got a fair rate. This was my first stay at the W.This hotel is located right next to Ground Zero and the new WTC 9/11 Memorial, there are a lot of tourists at ground level and it can get a little hectic. That said, you are in one of the best areas of downtown.Check-in was fast, we had a nice room with modern decor. There were some parts, like the bathroom that I thought were really odd, but overall nice. We had a great view of the memorial from the 9th Floor and could see the new Memorial Waterfalls which I think was awesome.On the rest of the hotel. The elevators and other areas of the hotel are jazzed out with style, it was all a little overwhelming. The food at the bar was average but ok (nice tap list) and the bar at night has a DJ and is a place to be seen. Expensive but innovative cocktails.So why isn't the hotel more than average? Noise. The hotel is loud and in a loud area, you won't get much sleep, in spite of the very comfortable bed. For the price we paid, you expect a good night's sleep. I just think that goes without saying. We had a heating/air vent that zoomed on at 3 AM and woke us both up, never did get back to bed. Overall, if you are a light sleeper and can get a deal, this is a great option, for me the noise didn't ruin the hotel, but took it down from something I can truly recommend to one that I recommend caution with.","New York City, New York","Reason88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",56,3.0

There was a large contingent of people from the race staying at the hotel, as it was close to the finish line. My experience was decidedly mixed. There is no escaping the fact that this is a dreadfully hip establishment, and I'm fairly certain that I'm not hip enough for it. When I arrived at 6pm it was already getting challenging to navigate the lobby, due to the mood lighting and the DJ. By the time I returned from dinner at 10pm the lobby was so darned cool that I could barely find the elevators in the dark. More hip music selections in the (pink lava-lamp themed) elevators, and you'll surely want to buy the cool CD of W music that's available in your room. The rooms are full of more hip and cool stuff. Looking like it was designed by folks who fancy themselves as minor league Jonny Ive types. Few opportunities are missed to do something in an out of the ordinary way. Like, even the toilet flush was unusual. You might really like this, you might not. I found it cute, but not a reason to choose to stay there.There are plenty of things that are good about the hotel. First, the beds. The mattress was a little on the soft side for my taste, but the bedding was heavenly. I so wish I didn't have to get up at 4am for my race. And the shower is outstanding -- very, very well received after the race. My room was on the 17th floor on the north side, where it directly overlooks the 9/11 Memorial and growing Freedom Tower. Amazing view. This might not persist, as there's another building under construction between W and the WTC. The coffee in the lobby in the morning is rather good. The rooms don't feel too tiny by NYC standards (I had one with 2 doubles).Then the not so good. First, $17/day for wifi is a joke. We know it costs them very little to run it (that's why the less pricey hotels don't charge you for it). Second, it feels like the room is more of a product placement experience than a place to stay and rest. And that relates to my main complaint, which is a bit of a rant about the difficulty of getting a morning coffee (... given how much I had paid for the room). Most normal places have in room coffee. But there's no space for that at W, given the amount of real estate that's needed for product placements. But there's a little note hidden in an alcove that says that you can request a coffee maker if you'd like one. Great! I really could use that for the 4am start. I ask the concierge: ""Sure, no problem"". By the time I get back to my room she's on the phone saying that they were fresh out of them. But that's no problem, as they say that you can get it in the lobby any time in the morning. ""I have to be up at 4am, which is on the early side for that kind of thing."" ""No problem."" [... too few hours of sleep in the wonderful bed ...]. At 4:15 when I go to the lobby, the new concierge looks at me like I'm nuts when I ask about coffee. He seems kind of annoyed to see somebody at that time of the night. I know this isn't a huge deal, but it just seemed symptomatic of where this hotel's priorities are. Being a hipster shouldn't mean that you can forget the basics.I was foolish enough to bring my car with me to New York. Fortunately, the Icon garage around the corner from the W has a $35/day rate for W guests, which is not bad for NYC prices, and much better than their regular $62/day rate.","Maryland, USA","CPtraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland, USA</strong>",101,3.0

Loads to see downtown but at night things are a bit quieter, you are not barging past crowds to get from A-Z like you are around Times Square. I stayed for 3 nights in a twin, double room. Best bits, the beds are sooooo comfy to sleep in, crisp, white linen, super soft pillows and lots of them. The room was a really good size, the best size I've experienced in a NY hotel ; so rare. The shower was amazing, powerful and easy to operate/find the right temperature. Bathroom came with decent toiletries inc bath robe and a powerful hair dryer (ladies you can leave yours behind at home)! The room had all the mod cons: plasma TV mounted on the wall, DAB radio come iPod dock, air con, in room mini bar. There was ample storage and wardrobe space for a short stay. The view from the bedroom window was fab, you walk in and are instantly drawn to the big windows, lots of light floods in. I had an amazing view of the financial district's skyscrapers and the Ground Zero memorial site. Seeing it from 17 floors up was very impressive. So what else about this hotel? It is über trendy in its design, you could be forgiven for thinking you'd walked in to an upmarket bar rather than a hotel. It is clealry trying to appeal to the hip young, clubbing, crowd. Just to the side of reception you’ll see some DJ decks for the evenings ambience. Despite this, I never heard the music or the crowd from my room. The scene may or may not be your thing but it's not intimidating. I don’t consider myself trendy nor does my old man, who travelled with me, but he was fine with it all, if not slightly bemused.All staff I met were friendly and more than happy to help. Check in was quick and easy, within moments I had key card in hand and was catching the lift to my room. The hotel was quiet, no noisy neighbours, my room was directly opposite the lift and I didn't hear a peep.The hotel includes a couple of bars/restaurants - the one bar has a balcony on three sides which might be nice on a warm evening. There is also a gym - I didn't get chance to explore these options but its there if you need it. Every morning they put out free coffee and tea which you can help yourself to - nice little touch before you head out for a day of fun in the city. For me this particular visit was about comfort. Knowing I wouldn't be in my room much but would be totally exhausted when I was, I wanted comfort and quiet so I could get a good kip in. The comfort of the bed, the space to move around the room easily without tripping over suitcases and each other is why this hotel worked for me.As for rate, well I believe I had a steal. Booked last minute-ish via Expedia and paid £350 for 3 nights for two adults, sharing a twin, room only. The acid test...would I return...Yes, Yes and Yes.

A word about the area - it is uneventful really. Another reviewed called it ""soulless"" and while I wouldn't go that far, I would say that there are better neighborhoods to stay in. For the hotel, I think this hotel was nicely done. I have an issue with the lobby check in simply because it's small and if there are a lot of people trying to check, it could be crowded. I really enjoyed the decor (even if modern / trendy isn't my personal taste). My room was clean and comfortable. Like many other W's, there was alot of snacks and other items taking up space on the desk. Speaking of the desk, it was slightly small for my business needs. I'm sure a larger room wouldn't have this issue. I absolutely loved the window seat they had. I sat there while preparing for a meeting instead of the desk. Bed was of course, very comfortable. I agree with another reviewer who said it would have been nice to have towel hooks. The counter space was also small. Shower was great though. I used the gym once and preferred the gym at The Westin, mainly for the equipment and space. However, the gym was still good and really my only complaint is having to walk through the lobby to get to the second set of elevators to use the gym. I found the staff to be very friendly here too - not annoying friendly but just enough. BLT restaurant was cute and I really enjoyed my lunch.

We checked in as SPG Gold members and they gave us an enhanced room upgrade and your choice of the new benefits, with a 4 PM checkout. Overlooks the WTC construction and reflection pools. One minor issue my brother had was that the construction site is pretty well lit up all through the night so the roller-shade really doesn't fully block out all of the light. It didn't bother me at all, but for some it may. Bathrooms- nice and very clean. We had lunch at BLT Grill after we checked in which was very good and they make a big martini!

The sleeping area was superb and the bathroom was a real luxury. The staff were all very courteous and attentive.That being said there are one or two drawbacks. First of all I a, not a fan of the financial district. It is a soulless part of an otherwise vibrant city. In future I would opt for a hotel in Soho, the Village, or possibly closer to Union Square. Second of all, I personally feel that the W chain takes itself too seriously and often feel that the modernity comes at a cost of some basic practicalities and creature comforts. The room was marvelous but the bathroom lacked some basic fixtures for hanging up wet towels for example. The darkness in the lobby and bar areas seem cool at first but when black greets you in every room even at 9am it becomes a little tired very quickly. The most irritating aspect of the stay was the so-called complimentary Accura car service. Upon check-in you are told that there's is one free complimentary drop off in the city with the hotel's Accura fleet for each day of your stay. We tried to book this on three separate occasions without success. We also witnessed other guests being told that the service was unavailable.

But at some point it starts to feel as though this hotel is trying too hard. The entrance is under construction now and it's a bit awkward finding your way in but you need to get an elevator to the 5th floor. In the spirit of hipness, it's dark at the check-in desk-very dark. So dark that when you go to the elevators, you can't see the buttons to press. It's very loud on that floor.Very,very loud. Did I mention that it was loud? You ascend to your floor and then struggle with the hip touch-card door key, trying not to feel silly, and eventually figure it out. But even in your room you can still hear the techno from the lower floors. Not too bad, but, you know, it's techno. Hard to ignore as a background thump.Room is fine -pretty standard. Not the hotels fault but LOTS of construction noise from World Trade Center construction which starts pretty early in the am.Service too is a little bit...lacking. No newspaper delivery as promised. No restocking of the mini-bar, No restocking even when called. Room does not appear to be nicely tidied in the day.All in all, an overage of the average. This place is I think a little over-hipped and maybe over-hyped.

I am not much of a hipster, but wasn’t bothered at all by the music or the crowd, it is exactly what you would expect at a W. They do cater to the young and hip, if your not comfortable with this, you should look elsewhere. I also do not mind the downtown location but it isn’t for everyone – if you are looking for a quick weekend and want to be in the middle of everything, you may want to consider other neighborhoods. The service was OK, not great – we waited a while at check in and to get settled. When we got to our room, our key didn’t work so we had to go back to the desk – the whole thing just took way to long. The biggest disappointment was the cleanliness of the room – huge turnoff, and the main reason for the poor rating. The walls were scuffed up, just looked very dirty. There were hangers in the closet from another hotel. I wouldn’t stay again just for the cleanliness factor – it wasn’t dirty enough to make me check out, but dirty enough to make me uncomfortable and not want to hang out in the room. Not what I would expect from the W or at that price point. One note - we stayed here on a weekend, so it was pretty slow. It was also prior to the 9/11 Memorial opening, so it may be busier now.","Boston, Massachusetts","Higbie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",16,2.0

This place is crawling with sock-headed hipsters. The Carlyle is less pretentious and a lot less annoying.

Attached to the lobby is the lobby bar (ok, so far sounds normal, right?) but then they decided to fill the empty space with... A DJ setup. You then have to walk across an empty dance floor with the DJ on your right and bar patrons on your left, disco ball overhead, just to get to the elevator that goes to your room. When you are travel weary and carrying luggage, believe me this is not a relaxing welcome. The following morning we woke up to No Coffee in our room. A small sign indicates that there is complimentary coffee on the fifth floor. Great, I'll go grab some cups and dance my way to some java. I'm redirected to the second floor. 8 bucks plus tip later, I have my coffee. Apparently, the coffee is only complimentary on the fifth floor between 6-10am. That's just lame.

Though availability is limited, do take advantage of this service. Nadir drove me all the way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art at no charge.

All this goodwill started to slip away once I had a better sense of their customer service. The concierge was terrible at fulfilling simple requests (ex. on two occasions, I asked for a bowl to be sent up to the room in the morning only to realize that it was never going to come) and miscommunication by the staff was not handled professionally at all (ex. I was told that I could have the front desk print a document for me and that I should bring it down on a flash drive, but upon arriving at the front desk, the rude clerk told me they can't extract information from flash drives at the front desk and that I needed to email it to her.

I was blown away by the level of detail. However, I felt basic hotel services were sorely lacking in that detail. 1. The outside temperature in Manhattan during my stay (12/15-12/19) was from 25-35 degrees. The heater was not working and had to be serviced. 2. My first night, I ordered room service twice (at different times during that night). The first order came within a respectable 30-35 minutes, but the second order had never come up. When I called back, they insisted the order had never been placed. Rather than argue, I told the Whatever Whenever person I would cancel the order and find food elsewhere, as I had been waiting for over 45 minutes. They then persuaded me to stay and wait for meal...the meal did come and it was not added to the bill. The next morning, I ordered room service and the pancakes were not cooked correctly. I was leaving for a meeting, so I didn't complain. That evening, I ordered room service again and the meal was fine, but the delivery person confronted me about the last night's order. WHY? I again told him that I had placed two separate orders that were about 30 minutes from each other. But he was more interested in tellling me that he filled my order. I found that to be unprofessional. 3. On Sunday, 12/18, I called Whatever whenever around 10:05am to have valet retrieve my car. I waited about 10 minutes before going to get it. When I got there, the bell person told it was on the way. At 10:25am, there was still no car. We proceeded upstairs to the front desk to ask them where the car was. She checked with the valet service and said it was on the way. Rather than wait downstairs in the freezing hotel lobby, we decided to stay on the reception level floor for another 10 minutes. We went down to the lobby about 10:40am and there still was no car. We had gone back the front desk to say that we had been waiting over 30+ minutes for our car. We had to show her the ticket again, describe our car in full detail. After 10 minutes of phone calls and her rationalizing this mistake, the car was returned to us about 10:55am. Normally, I wouldn't raise an issue about a slight mistake, but I found that the staff didn't take responsibility in their mistakes and should not engage the guest in what went wrong.

I spoke with Kareem the next morning and, to our surprise, he was able to obtain tickets for us, as well as the family members we were visiting (9 in total!) He was extremely pleasant and helpful! The tix were for different admission times a half-hour apart, but he said it shouldn't be a problem. However, he noted that if when we got there they gave us a hard time he said to call him and he would come across the street and speak with the WTC staff. An amazing offer of service! We checked out of our room and stored our luggage for much of the day before returning to find Richie again who shlepped our luggage - more than a block away - to load our car.Although we were only there for one night, we enjoyed our stay tremendously and felt very well-cared-for.

It does face directly over the 9/11 Memorial. But, the traffic of people going there makes it difficult to get in or out of the area. Not to mention it is in the heart of the Financial District, if you try to get out of the area for dinner, good luck with that. The nearest subway station is at least 4 blocks away. You can try to wait for a cab, but it's infrequent. Best bet, go down to Marriott on West Ave and go to the taxi line. Better yet, go across the street, there's alot of cab drop off and it's easier to pick up a cab there. The hotel does have a drop off service that goes as far uptown as 82nd street, but it's essentially a glorified sale pitch they partnered with Acura, which they show you a little video and ask you to fill out a feedback card.

It directly overlooks the World Trade Center building site and memorial. The 5th floor lobby includes an observation deck that doubles as an outdoor lounge, offering World Trade Center views unlike any others in the city. If you get a room on a high, north-facing floor, you'll get that, as well as million dollar views of the entire city. While I managed to get an upgraded, corner room, my view wasn't great, but the room itself was fantastic.Decor is very modern - almost Jetsons modern - with stark white walls and white furniture contrasting with chocolate brown carpeting and bathroom tile. The corner room included an L-shaped padded window seat that was a nice bonus for taking in the views.The pros for this hotel: 1. Easily accessible by subway. Take the A Train from the Howard Beach station to the Fulton street exit. The hotel is about 4 blocks away. To get pretty much anywhere uptown, take the 1 train at the Rector street station around the corner. There are several subway stations in the area, but this one is closest.2. Swanky lobby with cool bar, observation deck and evening DJ. Order drinks, order food, see and be seen.3. Comfortable room with great bedding. Bathroom has a big shower with dark tile that almost looks like brown leather. Try to get on a high floor. Even if you don't face uptown, the views can be excellent, regardless.4. If you're visiting the 9-11 Memorial, the entrance is literally across the street. Be sure to reserve your entry time in advance.The cons:1. The only downside to the room was that I thought the bathroom lighting was kind of dim.2. Now that the 9-11 Memorial is open, there are a LOT of people in this part of town. The Wall Street area used to be very quiet on the weekends because there isn't a ton of tourist stuff to see. That's changed.3. Construction noise is constant during the day, including Saturday. The hotel is so close to the WTC site, you hear it all. However, they stop at night, so sleeping isn't an issue. But don't plan on a peaceful afternoon nap.4. There aren't very many good dining or shopping options in this part of town. But it's so easy to get to all of the great neighborhoods by subway, that didn't really matter to me. Subway is definitely quicker than a cab through the narrow, clogged streets in this area.All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It's a very different experience than you would get versus staying in the Times Square area, which is so tourist focused. I'd prefer to be away from all of that unless going to a show or dinner. Aside from the WTC, you're also closer to the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge and not too far from SoHo. The hotel can also offer some pretty good rates during non-peak times.

I really don't know how to explain our experience. We arrived late because we were driving from the Boston area. When we arrived, we were greeted cordially by a doorman and escorted to the lobby on the 5th floor.When we arrived on the 5th floor, there was an incredible blast of music! The music was somewhere between disco and rap. My husband and I owned a discotheque for six years, so we were not too shocked. What were disconcerting were the lights on the curved ceiling that reflected off the floor. The experience was not good. We had to navigate to the next set of elevators. The optical Illusion was not comfortable; we felt like we were drunk.  At first, we thought since we're older than the target demographic, we couldn't make a fair evaluation. However, after talking with young people (late twenties to forties), they felt the same way. They told us that they were upset and disoriented by the lights, music, and layout of the hotel.  Our room 2211 was clean but extremely small. The bed was very comfortable and probably the best part of our stay. The bathroom had very little space. There was nowhere to put a toothbrush or any cosmetics. Maybe, this would be a great room for a single business person. If you would like to see how you look before proceeding to a meeting, you would wonder, where is the mirror? It's on the backside of the closet door. If you open the closet door, lean against the other door, and you're really thin you might be able to see yourself.  We stayed at the W in Boston, and it was one of the best experiences in our lives. The ""W"" NYC Downtown needs to take a look at what other ""W"" hotels do.  Our children live in NYC, and we visit often. This was our first stay at the W Downtown NYC. We won't be back. The location was bad; the streets and sidewalks were blocked off due to construction. We couldn't even take a walk. We were trapped like rats in a maze. Our advice to the ""W"" Downtown is to:1. Expand your target demographic and redesign the lobby and guest rooms to meet the needs of a more diverse clientele. All guests whether they are 20 or 60 want a quiet, clean, comfortable place to relax. I believe all travelers, business people, and tourists want the same thing. 2. Put a shelf in the bathroom so guests can store their toiletries. 3. Install a full-length mirror on the outside of the closet door.4. Repaint in the guestrooms and hallways—this would freshen up and brighten up these areas. 5. Work out a plan with the cab companies to actually come down the street for customers. Your doorman told us to just go take the subway!6. Visit some great hotels in the area like the Andaz and Gild Hall to pick up some pointers.7. Rearrange the elevator configuration. Going up five floors to the lobby is not a good plan. Guests should not have to wangle their way from the check-in desk, go across the dance floor, and walk in front of the DJ to get to the next bank of elevators which will eventually take them to their rooms.8. Tone down the elevator music. Find music that is appealing to all. 9. Supply the correct email address when sending out a survey. GMWolfgang.Wehen@whotels.com is not a valid email address. The email gets returned. Remove the GM—we called to get the correct address.Unfortunately, you cannot change your location! Maybe in about ten years when the construction has stopped this will be a good location. Sincerely,Mike and Jane (Starwood Preferred Guests)The GM, Wolfgang Wehen, actually read and responded to our concerns. This is a step in the right direction! Retrain or fire you current employees. Focus point: Customer Service.

How unfortunate that we stayed at The Ritz first! What an poor contrast for the W. My review for the W is as follows: The lobby is kitschy and attractive, but with a strong dose of citrusy potpourri that I didn't care for. The hallways have a most unpleasant dirty carpet smell that they try to cover up with air freshener, and are dark and dingy. The whole hotel had a humid feeling that wasn't appealing.Our $3,000.00 per night ""extreme wow suite"" looked nothing like the photos on line. I realize that there are different suites, but the decor in ours was pretty dated. It was muggy and stuffy when we opened the door. The tub was clean, but there was dirt in the grout around the tub and shower in the bathroom. Not what you expect to see for that kind of money. Also, it is very small. They told us when we booked that the room would sleep 6 people. There is ONE queen-sized bed, ONE bathroom, and a small living room with stained, not-so-fresh smelling furniture. They brought in 3 roll-away beds for us with fresh, clean sheets, but they had lumpy mattresses, and because fire safety laws limit the rollaways to 3, one person had to sleep on that couch. The patio is large and beautiful, but the cushions on the outdoor furniture were sun-faded and grimy, and one of the planters smelled as though the last guests urinated in it. There is very dim lighting out there, also. If there were another bathroom, it would be a fine place to have a party, with the large balcony, and great sound system, but then your guests would have to leave because there is no place for them to sleep.About the amenities:They knew they had 6 guests coming, and there was ONE 2 inch bar of nice smelling soap, and one each of some sample toiletries. Come on, not even a separate dinky bar of soap for the sink, shower and tub? One roll of toilet paper on the spindle and another far away in the hall closet. Two wine glasses, and a few champagne flutes with fingerprints on them. One of the wine glasses had lipstick on it. They gave us a bowl of beautiful green apples in the living area, and the one I took off the top was delicious. The ones on the bottom had brown rotten spots with mold in the centers on the underside, leading me to believe that the service staff replaces only the apples on top between guests, leaving the bottom ones until they ferment.A word about how that ""whatever, whenever"" slogan : Baloney. The concierge never answered the phone him or herself the whole time we were there. You are expected to leave a message. I decided against room service after seeing the moldy apples, and went down to the continental breakfast at the bar area. I found the domes that contained the baked goods smeared with fingerprints, so I chose a yogurt. I asked for honey to top it, and was told they had it, but then they couldn't find it. The clerk sighed, and said she COULD run downstairs and get it, IF I wanted to wait. I did not, seeing as how it took 10 minutes to purchase a cup of yogurt.I found some of the staff friendly, but some sullen, as though they were tired of listening to the complaints of their customers. Friendly or not, the service is quite slow.All in all, I thought this hotel seemed to be a dated partiers crash-pad type of place, and not at all what I expected for the money.

There's a lot of storage space and the television has Showtime and HBO, so I was able to watch my favorite series! Of coarse the bed is like any other W bed and the robes were too. Cool thing about this hotel is that you must leave your key in a pocket at the door to turn the lights on. The idea is great. You only have to wave your key near the door also to open it which makes it much easier to get in when you have bags in your hands. There is a free coffee, tea, breakfast thing in the morning near the concierge desk, but of coarse I missed it because I didn't wake up until 11. This place is great, especially for the price.

The hotel is in a good location. Is is right beside the WTC area. The hotel terrace overlooks current construction going on at Ground Zero. This may be a plus or minus, depending on how you look at it. We thought it was really neat to see this in progress and the construction noise didn't bother us, although you could definitely hear it all through the night (just didn't bother us). After all WTC construction is complete, the view will be amazing. The hotel sits just south, so rooms on the north side would give the best views of WTC. The hotel is right around the corner from the Rector St. train (lines 1 & R). It's easy to get around the financial district on foot and midtown Manhattan is very accessible via the Rector St. trains. The area seemed very safe and there were plenty of small restaurants nearby. There are delis and cafes and pizza places unique to NYC and a Burger King, Starbucks and Subway all just a short walk from the hotel. If you are visiting The Statue of Liberty from Battery Park, the ferry station is also a very short walk from the hotel. It would probably take longer to take the train.The hotel's BLT Grill has very good food but it's very expensive. We ate there one night and our bill for two ran about $140. The food was VERY GOOD. The service was not great. The waiters were friendly enough, just seemed to be overworked/busy and our food took forever, glasses were not filled, I received a white wine when I ordered a red, etc.The hotel's interior is very artsy in a youthful contemporary way. A lot of attention to detail is given. When you enter the elevator, the floor mat will say GOOD MORNING in the morning, GOOD AFTERNOON in the afternoon and GOOD EVENING at night. The rooms also looked as if they were designed by an art student. I was pleased with the look and everything was very clean. The room was EXTREMELY small. That was fine with us. There were two of us and with a king size bed, we had just enough walking space for luggage. Speaking of the bed, it was VERY COMFORTABLE. It was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever experienced! I liked the down pillows and comforter. There were marks on the wall as I've seen in several reviews. The hotel is very new and it did look older than it is. I have 2 small kids and have lived where I do 10 years and my walls are less marred. So, they probably should give the rooms a new paint job. There were two things that bothered me about the room. One was, the bathroom door (which was a sliding door) required TWO PEOPLE to close it and it was only with great effort at that. Another issue I had was that there is a red light which stays on in the closet. It looks really cool when you open it HOWEVER, at night, when your lights are off, you can see a little light coming out of the closet. That was a little annoying/distracting. Other than that, it was nice and comfortable and seemed safe, just not as new looking as it should look and small. By the way, the bathroom was a decent size, it was only the bedroom that was micro.One more thing I'll add... You can get internet access for your room for about $15/night. We wanted that but didn't realize, it was not $15 for the whole hotel room but for every single device we had on the internet. We had a laptop, an iPad, a GPS device and an iPad Touch and we accessed the internet with all 4 devices which cost us $60/night - ugg.

The hotel is entirely non smoking and has great views from some of the rooms, especially of the Ground Zero and memorial area. The fitness center was well appointed and I had it to myself most of the time.The rooms are bright and well appointed with ammenities for both business and pleasure. For example. there was candy from Dylan's but also highlighters in the desk should I need them. I was upgraded to a Corner Cool room which means I had wrap around windows. The room is really not different from other rooms. This hotel is definately not traditional so therefore, not for everyone however if you like Ws and something a bit different and are aware you are in the Financial District, then you will like this hotel.

We spent 30 minutes trying to tell her that it was our second day there and all of our stuff was in our room! She would not listen to us and was very rude. Finally somehow she decided to contact a manager who then made us aware that the elevator was not working properly and that you had to swipe the card, then press the button on the opposite side of the elevator in order for it to work properly. After this ordeal we received no apology. Another frustrating part of our stay was the facT that nobody EVER answered the phone when we would call from our room! I've NEVER been to a hotel where they don't answer after a few rings, let alone don't answer at all!!! We had a problem with the TV in our room and not only did my wife have to come downstairs because nobody would answer the phone, but it took 45 minutes for someone to come fix the TV! On top of all this, the day after our wedding we're laying in bed and a window washer on a scaffold stops at our window and stares at us in bed!!! We couldn't believe that even on a high floor we had no privacy in the room! For the money that we prepaid for the room I couldn't believe that we were treated so rudely by the whole staff. Not one person congratulated us for being married or said anything even remotely nice to us, maybe this is the attitude of the hotel but we couldn't believe how unbelievably rude everyone was.

This is an acceptable hotel (though not a credit to the W brand), but I would be unlikely to return to this property.The front desk staff was enthusiastic and helpful at check-in, and once someone arrived at the front desk, he was very efficient at check-out, as well. We were generally greeted by the doormen at the hotel entrance. The fifth-floor lobby of the hotel is a cool appealing and whimsical design, though fairly dark. The shower was the best I have had in a W hotel (combining aspects of the rainfall shower without the anaemic water pressure). Other reviewers have noted noise issues at this hotel, but my room was very quiet. Glimpses of the river could be caught between buildings from the room. These were the high points of our experience at the hotel.Other aspects of the hotel were somewhat disappointing.The room was quite small (even by New York standards), and it should probably have been outfitted with a Queen instead of a King bed. Even with the corner room’s windows (one of which was able to open), it felt very cramped and probably ill-suited for more than one person. The pocket door on the bathroom seemed cheap, but it is unclear whether there would have been clearance for a proper door. Despite having been booked directly through Starwood, this had the feel of the rooms I would get at the Grand Hyatt in New York when I booked through Hotwire/Expedia as a student. At less than one year old, the room in which I stayed was not wearing well. The white walls were scuffed in various places, and there were obvious patches that had been made. There were a couple of drips of water coming out from between the panels underneath the sink. In addition, while the room size is not an issue that can be overcome, I would have expected the room to be slightly cleaner, as there was visible dust in several places when I arrived (including on the mini-bar snack tray items). I was also disappointed that the terrace off of the lobby was closed when I tried to go out in the afternoon and that none of the staff in the area offered any assistance (or even telling us that it was closed) as we tried multiple doors. Finally, this is the first W at which I have stayed where I was overwhelmed by the brand’s signature scent. A friend and I had to literally hold our breath in the elevator from the street level to the lobby at one point. None of these were enough to ruin my stay, but there are certainly better hotels in the area. I expect better of this brand. In this area of Lower Manhattan, I have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park and the Millennium Hilton, and I would recommend the former if you can get a decent rate (it is a couple of blocks further south, but its rooms are quite large with harbour views and telescopes for looking at the Statue of Liberty). I am not normally a huge fan of staying off the island when visiting New York, but given the proximity and convenience of the PATH station (both to the World Trade Centre and the hotel in New Jersey), SPG members needing to be in Lower Manhattan should seriously consider the excellent W Hoboken. The hotel is located across the street from the site of the World Trade Centre. Once the pavilion opens, it will be easier to get around this area (including to the PATH station on the other side). There seemed to be a shortage of taxis on the hotel’s street, but they can be more easily found a couple of blocks to the east. There is a Starbucks across the street from the hotel, and we went to Tribeca to eat because there are not very many options in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.","Ottawa, Canada","YOWboys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",30,3.0

Our room had a funny smell...I should have had our room changed but by the time I realized the smell wasnt going away I didn't feel like packing everything back up, etc. The blackout shades allow light in through the sides...this is a MAJOR design flaw!!! Ive never stayed in a hotel that this happened. At 8am it looked like we had spotlights on in our room! If you are looking to sleep in and relax, stay somewhere else. We faced ground zero so maybe if you stay on the south side the light isn't as bad. Cleanliness wasn't an issue and the bed was extremely comfortable. Service was ok, on par with other W's. I feel as a whole W's used to have amazing service but over the last two years they have been average. I believe rooms start around 200$...that is a steal for nyc.

We stayed on the South side of the hotel, which had a great view—we could see a bit of the river from the 21st floor—and was extremely quiet. We found the service to be excellent: fast check-in/check-out, helpful bellhops and an especially accommodating desk clerk who found a packet of theater tickets we left behind while checking in (he brought them directly to our room himself, without any prompting on our part—we hadn't realized we'd forgotten them!). We didn't try the bar or restaurant, nor did we use valet parking (too steep; we got a much better deal at a garage nearby). Subway is close by, and the downtown area has some great parks, biking, shopping (Century 21—I could have stayed there for hours!) and sightseeing.

The lobby and bar are distinctively decorated (I smiled every time I walked through), but the rooms are stark submarine-like pods. The carpet is dark, the walls are ceiling are the same shade of white, and the only color is a few small dashes of red (piping on a throw pillow). There are no pictures or decoration of any type on the walls, and all lamps and accessories are very high tech looking (though not very functional). If you ask for a room facing Ground Zero, you'll have an awesome view of the construction, as the crews work 24/7 to complete as much as possible by the 10th anniversary on 9/11. (If you don't like the sound of heavy construction equipment at night, ask for a room on the other side.)The W is also located close to Trinity Church, Wall Street and numerous subway stations. In addition, the complimentary Acura Experience service offered by the W is great when you don't feel like taking the subway.Our disappointment with this property was the maintenance and the service. The bathroom tiles looked like leather and snakeskin, but the bathroom layout was not very functional. In addition, every towel rack or hanger in the bathroom was loose and wobbly, so that things literally fell off the walls. While most of the staff members were very friendly and professional, there were some very notable exceptions. One of the concierge staff members was rude and acted like her job would be great if she didn't have to deal with pesky hotel guests--what a bother. In addition, our two experiences with the bar were disappointing. The outside bar overlooks Ground Zero, but you have to put up with indifferent service and ridiculously overpriced (and bad) cocktails. When we sat down in the inside bar on another evening, the staff didn't even acknowledge our presence, so we left without being served. On a positive note, when I mentioned these things to the front desk, they apologized and a manager followed up with an email.

The lobby was very funky and modern. The rooms were tastefully decorated but be warned that if you face the 9/11 site I could hear the construction at night and if I wasn't so tired it would probably bug me. Upon opening the dufet, found several stained marks on the bed sheets. This was a severe surprise as I did not expect that from a Starwood property!! A quick phone call and 5 minutes later someone came to replace the sheets. No apologies from phone operator or the house cleaning staff which I found strange but I was tired and moved on with my life!Next morning I found stained face towels and asked for a toothbrush but it never came in the 45 minutes after call and had to run to my first meeting. The hotel fell short of my expectations again.I must say that Nicole at the concierge desk went over and beyond to help me locate a plastic bag. She was very pleasant and genuinely tried to locate a bag that would fit the toys for my nephews. I would give her 110% for service excellence.

The view from the room on the north side is spectacular: the Ground Zero construction site.

While we were on our way to the 5th level for the check in, he was informing us about the different facilities in the hotel. The front desk staff was helpful and the check in was a swift.

And my bathroom does not come with the frosted glass door feature.The gym is consider big when compared to most hotels. And it's well equiped with weights and treadmills. Our package came with compimentary drinks and nibbles at the bar. Even though it's nibbles, some of them can be considered as main courses if you are not a big eater. The nibbles are really good. My favourites are the grilled octopus, shrimp cocktail, crab dip and pappardelle ragu. We were there for three consecutive nights and Cassandra, the hostess, was always very helpful and friendly.

I'm pleased to report the team at the W New York - Downtown made a recent one night stay a real pleasure. It started at the front door. I was warmly greeted, my bags were taken upstairs to the lobby, and a team of smiling employees met me to get me checked in. While I waited, a bellman brought me a glass of complimentary sparkling water from the bar.W takes care of details. This particular hotel is across the street from the Freedom Tower construction site at the location of the World Trade Center. The employee made sure to check me into a room on the side of the building opposite of the construction site where jackhammers start at 6 a.m.The bellman showed me to my room and explained that the hotel was an eco-friendly hotel. One interesting touch: to turn on the lights in the room, you insert your room key into a special device near the room's entrance. Remove the key and your lights go out on a timer. Keep the key in and the lights stay on.As I think about it, every single employee I encountered at this hotel was pleasant and helpful. The concierge helped me get show tickets and recommended a nearby restaurant. (It had opened 4 months earlier and was excellent.) Later in the evening, she recommended a special cocktail to try at the hotel bar. Before she left work for the evening, she stopped by the bar to be sure I liked it. (I did.)Speaking of the bar, the bartenders and cocktail waitress were real pros. It was like they were welcoming me into their home. Later, the next day at breakfast in the hotel's restaurant, I had terrific service from everyone I encountered -- the hostess, the waiter, the busboy.As I departed, the bellman thanked me for staying with them and asked me to come back soon as he loaded my bags into a taxi.I can't remember the last time a hotel staff -- to a person -- was so gracious and personable. Even a housekeeper greeting me in the hallway singing as I made my way to check out.The only bad thing I can say about my experience was the housekeeper neglected to remove a previous guest's dirty brown sock which was laying on the room's brown carpet. That's it.Oh, and I scored this room on Priceline for 160 bucks on a Sunday night.I would definitely stay here again.

The next day after complaining again about the noise, especially since my stay was for business, not pleasure and I needed sleep, I was moved to an itsy bitsy room behind the elevators....again noise! Also, the rooms are in dire need of refurbishing, the walls and carpets are dirty. There was a ball of hair in the bathroom, ewww... Would not stay here again, that's for sure.","Miami, Fl","nina2727</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Fl</strong>",18,2.0

I have stayed at Ws before and haven't felt this way, so to me there's something about this one in particular. It started with the completely black foyer with only an elevator and the far away door to the bar. This is a very sparse and non-welcoming way to be greeted. Then I went to the 5th floor to check in, and walked into a lounge that was trying really hard to be a club. Unfortunately, I couldn't hear a thing the woman at the desk was saying because of the pounding club music from the DJ table a few steps away - so I had trouble hearing important things like ""your room number is..."" My hotel room had no TV remote, and while someone did bring it, it was annoying that it was missing in the first place. I ordered room service at one point, but the dessert I wanted was no longer being offered. The clock radio was set to 4:45am when I arrived at 9:30pm. The lighting in my room was WAY too white - I had to play with the various switches to make it less industrial and more ""homey."" The lighting was a problem in the bathroom, too, because it shined right down on me, creating shadows when I was trying to do my makeup. I had to use the scary magnifying mirror, so I did my makeup hunched over the sink to see into the little magnifying mirror. Also, I find it rather forced to be called by my first name by hotel staff. (Who wants this? I would think young people who would like it couldn't afford the W, and older people would appreciate a little less familiarity.) I'm not an old lady - I'm 37 - and I wonder how middle-aged guests view this familiarity. The wi-fi is rather pricey at $14.95 PER DEVICE per day, and the signal wasn't the strongest, either. I only used one device (my iPod) and was charged for two, so I was unable to use the automatic check out on the TV, as I had to go discuss the charge with the front desk. At least, during check out, there was no DJ blasting music, so we could actually hear each other. Finally, the W offers a free ride to certain parts of the city as an Acura promotion, but when I tried to use it, it was totally booked. Seems like there may only be one or two cars, so book immediately upon your arrival if you want to use it. On the plus side, I really liked the shower products, and the bed, as always, was very comfortable. The room service dinner was quite tasty, so I appreciated that. And the bathroom was fantastically clean - not a single stray hair from a prior guest. In all, I think there are a lot of kinks to work out here. I still like Starwood hotels, but might not choose this particular one again anytime soon.","Northern Virginia, USA","Cranky_Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern Virginia, USA</strong>",51,3.0

The WWC is right across the street; although there is construction- we did not hear anything inside the hotel. The PATH train is about 1 block north of the hotel. I definitely recommend taking this from New Jersey. We also never had a problem finding a cab on the weekends. The hotel is a perfect location for business travel yet perfect for people there on leisure who don’t want to be near the madness of Time Square.Rooms: Rooms are on the smaller side (smaller than the Westin at Times Square) but very clean & modern. Enough room for two people who really aren’t spending much time hanging out in the room. To get power in your room (lights, etc) you have to insert your room key in the slot in the wall- hotel is going green.Hotel: Hotel is very secure. You take an elevator from the bottom floor to the lobby. To get to your room, you must use a different set to elevators and swipe your room key card. This I like because no one from the outside world could take the elevators for a ride. The lobby had a darker night club feel. We stayed on a Friday night, so there was a DJ and guests relaxing in the lobby at night. This was a nice perk! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

The design of the lobby is quite cool. Dark, with a illuminated curved ceiling. This is probably the halmark of the property. Check in was courteous and attentive.I was a little dissappointed with the room. It seemed quite small, even for Manhattan standards. The TV was missing the AV input panel i've seen at a number of the other Sheraton properties. Too bad because I like to watch a movie from my laptop occassionally. For a new hotel, i think this is a oversite. In the bathroom again, i think there were gaps in quality, in favor of style. There were gaps in the trim, and some globs of caluking in some of the seams in the shower.

The hotel just opened in late 2010 and has yet to open all floors. Pros:- The hotel is right next to the World Trade Center so it's a great location if you're in NYC for business around the Wall Street area. However, if you're traveling for leisure, it can be quite a pain since it takes at least 15 minutes by subway to get to midtown. The subway is a quick 2-minute walk from the hotel. - The rooms are very spacious for a NYC hotel. The decor is consistent with the W brand and creates a very clean and modern look. I also love the Bliss Spa amenities.- We utilized the Acura car service as much as we could. It's a free service and can take you anywhere in Manhattan up to 90th street. You definitely need to book ahead though since it's a very popular service. I believe the hotel only has 2 cars available.- The employees were helpful and provided quick service. They were all friendly and very knowledgeable about the area.Cons:- The convenient location to Wall Street comes at a price. We arrived around 8:30 pm on a Thursday night and ended up switching rooms since we could easily hear construction of the World Trade Center. The front desk agent said the construction was supposed to end at 8 pm but it continued until about 9 pm. The noise must be very frustrating for business guests who are trying to work in their room. The front desk agent was very accommodating though in switching our rooms but I can see the noise causing a huge issue when the hotel is full with a limited number of rooms away from the construction.- The quality of construction seemed a bit spotty. Our bathroom door would always slide shut and the paint in certain areas of the hallway and lobby was already wearing thin. - If you're a leisure traveler looking for nightlife around the hotel on the weekends, I'd recommend a different location since the area will be dead. The hotel bar was also very empty on a Saturday night.- There is a kiosk in the lobby to check-in to your flight and print your boarding pass. I tried to use the kiosk twice and both times the system timed out. Though it's a great feature, the hotel needs to first make sure the system has no faults.- The TV channels were spotty with no reception on Saturday morning. This may have been a one-time issue since it only occurred then. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the W Hotel though it was a pain to be so far from midtown. I recommend the hotel for business guests and it'll be a great choice especially once construction of the World Trade Center is done!","San Jose, California","LC411</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",10,3.0

I stopped W'ing a few years ago because of a series of catastrophic FAILs. I even avoided most Starwood properties. I relayed this info to Sofia, the GM who is amazing at staying on TA to address the negative (and postitive reviews), alerting her I was going to try the brand one more time. My needy emails to the property were answered quickly and I was super excited to see if the Whatever/Whenever mantra was back. ""So far so good,"" I thought.Due to massive weather issues at Newark and ORD my flight was delayed. I got to the property at about 330am. And then my card had a fraud warning so I was stuck on the phone for 30 minutes getting it lifted. They brought a chair for me to sit on hold. I was thinking ""OK, my snafu and these guys are getting me a chair. W/W is back.""Easter Sunday was the tipping point for me (but please, don't let my kind of negative review dissuade you entirely, I simply have a W black cloud over me). I had confirmed the Acura Experience THREE times via email and in-person to be on the UES at 9:30 to see pals... Car is nowhere to be found. Plus, they had me leaving the W at 930 when it was communicated I needed to be up there at 930. AND, to keep adding more insult, they had another family booked for the car at the same time as me. A valet who was doing his best not to yell at me for yelling at him (yes, I lost control and they didn't so kudos to W for that) but he kept saying ""I don't know"" whenever I'd ask a question on reservations and car/driver location. So, they called a cab and reimbursed me. Big whoop! The whole point of these value-added services is to ADD VALUE. Why they didn't offer car service for their screw up is beyond me.The MOD came to see me while I was checking out and I'm sure they wanted me to leave with a smile not the ""I'm mad so you get a bad review on tripadvisor"" scowl. He was nice and cordial and I liked him but with all my past hiccups with the brand I told him I was done with Ws. To me, the Whatever/Whenever mantra was blasted over the car issue. I know that's a bad reason to give a property an ""average"" but the devil is in the details. Do you think this would happen at the Four Seasons or Mandarin? ABSOLUTELY NOT.That said, I don't know if the W is entirely responsible as they couldn't find the Acura driver. But the fact is quick-thinking hotel staff at premium properties are empowered to make every guest's experience seamless. Hailing a free cab is not a lateral move from an Acura Experience.Bar staff were fun and engaging, desk people were immensely helpful and all the various management people who I spoke with were all great. Everything but that car issue which seems nitpicky but anyone who has made this far into the review knows how one small, screwed up detail on a holiday will leave a funky taste. You will have fun and enjoy it. I have a dark cloud so I'm done with Ws.One quick tip, if you're flying out of Newark, make your cabby set his meter from the W to the airport. It's WAY cheaper on the meter going to the airport than it is coming to the hotel. Something with NJ/NY cabby rules or something...Oh, this stained towel remained in my room the whole weekend. How does that room with the stained towel get released in the system? Does housekeeping not see the stain at the fold of the towel?

The front desk staff was very accomodating and they gave us a lot of information about the hotel services, including the restaurant BLT, which we tried for brunch and loved! Our room was very nice and it was great to stay at a hotel that was so new. We went out in lower manhattan for dinner and the doorman was very accomodating in helping us get a cab. There is still a lot of construction going on near ground zero, but it was very quiet in the room and during the weekend it was relatively quiet around the outside of the hotel.

This hotel looks to the future - towards the completion of the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings and memorials. Once complete, I have no doubt the W downtown will be full to the brim with the hipster crowd downtown.It's only fair to disclose that the hotel looks over the World Trade Center construction site. This is not something the hotel has any control over but be aware that notwithstanding the hotel's best efforts to insulate the rooms, there is an audible amount of construction noise. I didn't notice any noise at night, but I only stayed over the weekend. OK - with that caveat, the rest of the review is entirely favorable. The coolest thing about check-in is the amazing lobby and light installation in the 5th floor lounge. It really transports you to another place and says you have arrived somewhere very special.The rooms were a nice size for NY - king size bed and the usual fabulous Bliss products. No bathtub, but it's not expected in NY where every square inch of the room has a functional purpose. The interior is super cool with white leather headboards and banquettes by the window, and very innovate and chic cabinetry which serves multiple purposes including desk, safe, closet, TV wall, bar fridge among a dozen other things while retaining a very sleek feel.The workout room is signature W and very well equipped, and the hotel bar and lobby areas are really cool.

The staff and management at the hotel were always available for any questions we had, Jason was especially kind, and we were very happy with everything at the hotel. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but that is what you get when staying in NYC. The beds were very comfortable and the gym is amazingly well equipped (I was very impressed with the gym and the fact that they don't charge extra to use it). The other extra touches like coffee in the morning, water and pressed cider in the afternoons were really nice as well.I will absolutely be staying at this hotel again, and if they do put a park on the site of the old Deutche Bank Building the views of the WTC memorial and Freedom Tower are going to be unbeatable.

Unfortunately at W-Downtown in our recent stay, sleeping was not an option. Construction noise was running at in excess of 80 decibels inside our guest room. On a number of nights construction noise ran until well after midnight, on the day we were checking out (which incidentally was a Saturday) construction noise began around 7.30am, which I guess was to be expected given that it had started at that time for the remainder of our stay. Half way through our stay I complained about the noise, the staff were courteous and apologetic and offered us another room. A room which would have been far too small, and did not appear to offer additional benefits with the exception of being on the side of the building and not facing Ground Zero. On the second last day of our stay, a voicemail came through at 10.04am (according to the message) to advise us that there would be no hot water in the hotel between 10am through to 4pm. I called Whatever Whenever (the Concierge Desk), to be advised that they did not know when hot water would be back on, and they would contact the company who had the gas off, hardly the pro-active response I would have expected from representatives of a Starwood hotel.Apart from the above, the hotel is new, has very nice and spacious rooms, with the exception of the side room that we were offered as an alternative, and has all the amenities you would expect in a W. I expect that the W Downtown will age fairly quickly given the white interiors, and I noticed in the room we were staying in, dirty black marks which had not been cleaned off, and some of the linen was already showing wear, particularly the towels.As you would appreciate I was extremely disappointed at the above inconveniences during our stay, particularly given that I had made it clear to the Starwood agent who had taken my booking that we would be on vacation, and we stayed in the hotel for 9 nights. My personal opinion is that Starwood either should not have opened this hotel, until the Dueche Bank building has been completely demolished (which the W’s staff told me would not be before at least the end of the year), or should be warning potential guests of the possible inconvenience, something they certainly did not do with me, although the manager on duty when I made further complaints on the day before we left told me he would ensure that happened in the future, something I will believe when I hear it with my own ears! All in all a very disappointing experience, and Starwood’s response has been to “gift me” points which I can redeem for a night’s accommodation. It hardly makes up for 9 very sleep disturbed nights, where we paid good money to stay in what should be a lovely hotel. I have stayed in Starwood hotels in at least seven different countries, all of our prior experiences have been positive in their hotels. I have never provided feedback such as this on a website previously. I provide this summary as a warning to potential guests of the W Downtown, so that they can make an informed decision before they commit to staying in this hotel. I should also add that I have passed on this feedback to the General Manager of the hotel in question some two weeks ago, she promised a response within three days, despite two follow up’s and two weeks passing no response has been received. Undoubtedly, indicative of what you can expect at the hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","paul21234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",3,2.0

And they managed to fit a queen sized bed, flat screen TV, full sized desk, closet, decently sized bathroom, all while STILL having room left to extend a multipurpose area by the window (which we all know is the coolest part of any W hotel room)??""How do they do it??Sigh* Only after five minutes of scanning the room do I manage to calm my brain down from the mysteries and wonders that can only come from superior interior design. Say THAT five times fast.Moving on: a half star docked because I just cannot understand why the shower (in its effort to look retro chic) has only a half-door. All the water splashes everywhere and leaves a mess. Eck.The staff at the W Hotel in Manhattan were extremely doting. I mentioned that I preferred a room above the 7th floor (less noise), so they assigned me to a quiet room on the 17th floor. In addition, after noticing that I placed a towel on the floor outside the (in my opinion, unfinished) shower area, housekeeping left a nice fluffy rug in its place when I returned. Thank ya much :)The concierge staff was supremely knowledgeable, and provided excellent directions and suggestions for the quickest and cheapest ways to get where we wanted to go. All I had to do was ask, for example, where I could find the best market for fruits within a walkable distance. And *poof* like magic, I would have three or four places to choose from within a matter of minutes. They sent me on my way with notes, directions, and a copy of that day's Wall Street Journal, and even a cup of lemon/lime infused water. It's the small touches.Overall, it was a very comfortable stay at one of Manhattan's most conveniently located hotels.

We learned, over the course of our 5 night stay, that many of the staff have been with W hotels for many years. They must have chosen the cream of the crop for opening this new location. Every single person we met was friendly and solicitous and if they did not know what to do, they did not hesitate to find someone who did. We were made to feel as valued guests.Hip,sleek, shiny, modern and pretty...... as you would expect from a W. The rooms were a good size for NYC standards. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom and shower was great. Linens were top notch and the towels new and plush. Kind of everything you would expect from the words ""W"" and ""new."" Coffee in the am and apples and water in the lobby was a nice touch.Although you are waayyy downtown, 3 major subway lines are within a block or 2 walk. The hotel has a Acura service that will drive you anywhere in the city for free. Just be prepared for a marketing pitch on the Acura. Not a hard sell though and it was a nice feature.We ate at BLT for dinner and it was outstanding. Still quiet but the food and service was great. Breakfast was just ""ehh.""Our only complaint involved noise. Understandably, the dismantling of the building across the street is beyond their control. All of lower Manhattan in transforming and building. No one knows what might be built in it's place but the current construction will be short term. We also heard no noise from room to room....a pet peeve of ours.But..........It is a tall and narrow building and almost all rooms on the floors have close proximity to the 3 elevators. The elevators did not create a problem in our room but the doors to the hall do not block the sound of the guests standing waiting for them. No one seems to realize how loud their voices are and how they carry once they are out of their own rooms. As the hotel becomes more occupied, this might be more of an issue.I don't know how they can fix our biggest issue. Late into the night (2-6am), when all external noise has subsided and the air-conditioner is not running, the music from the lobby can be heard through the air ducts. Our first night, we thought the speakers for the outside terrace bar had been left on. The next night, we thought it was a nearby rooftop club? Then we thought it might be from the elevators..... but the sound was coming from further inside the room. It wasn't until 3 nights into it that we figured out what it could possibly be. The Front desk said they have never heard anyone complain about this issue before. Maybe it was our room location or proximity to the lobby (were were on floor 8 and the lobby is on 5) or just the fact that we were up at that time??? I haven't heard anyone else mention this issue and cannot make recommendations as to how future guests might avoid this problem.Other than that, we had a wonderful stay.",,Msk6261,845,4.0

From the concierge (whom also helped me book my massage at the Bliss Soho, another assisted me when I left my key card in the room) to the bell hop (who gave me the full tour). The hotel design was breathtaking. The idea of using reflective lighting & keeping it simple really lends to a clean elegant atmosphere. I especially liked the watering closet in the lobby.

Scratches and dings all over the flat white walls. Spoke to GM and regrets using flat white paint. Room didn't have towels or hand soap on arrival. Great beds, great tv, cool phones, Apple docking system, descent size for NY. Seen smaller bathrooms. Rain shower was nice, but if your going to put a rain shower in the shower be sure to have multiple shower caps.

Ordered a cheese plate one night and it came with nothing. No breadsticks, crostinis, crackers, etc.. Just a few grapes? Never in my life have I had to pay for crackers or bread with a cheese plate.Location is 2-3 minutes from NYSE, Freedom Hall, Lehman, AIG, Trinity Church, etc. Will be one block from the new Freedom Tower when it's completed.View was not good from 801. Looking directly down at the construction cars and site, trash bins, etc... Reconstruction of the Freedom Tower is very important but the view from that side of the building is currently not to good.

This is a BRAND NEW hotel and all hip and wifi-ed and stuff. Has the W designer never traveled on business? We want to plug in our phones on the night stand and use our laptops in bed and you hide the outlets behind immovable furniture? Scores of business travelers wish a pox upon your house.

My boyfriend and I booked the W New York Downtown for a 3-day birthday getaway. I was upgraded to a Spectacular Room by the GM Sofia and when I checked it, the staff recognized it was a special day and personally wished me a happy birthday. Lauren was my W Insider and she had left a birthday gift plus a signed birthday card from the staff! Inside my room was a tiny birthday cake and two cans of fizzy white wine. There was also a gorgeous tissue-stuffed bag containing a special texturized beach book, beach wipes and sunblock. Lauren knew from my boyfriend that we were going kayaking out in CT for a day. On the second day, I got another birthday card plus a rubber W luggage tag (very cute!)Note: Prior to my stay, Lauren contacted me and asked if I needed any help with reservations or suggestions. As a New Yorker, I didn't need any recos but took up her help in getting reservations to a notoriously difficult-to-get-reservations restaurant. Lauren and Joy (W Concierge) were able to score the reservations I wanted. Brilliant!ROOMThe room itself was very comfortable. I'm not usually a fan of such modern design but it was very chic and warmer than I thought from the pics on the website. The bed was extremely comfortable (like all Starwood properties!) The shower is small but no smaller than most New York hotel rooms. The downside is the construction over the WTC. You'll get awesome views but construction starts at 7am Mon-Sat. We were on the 7th floor and across from the elevator. The walls are thin and so noise travels. We had an issue with the guest next door playing music (all rooms come with an ipod docking station) starting at 7am on a Sunday, the one day construction didn't occur. Luckily, we enjoyed his taste in music. The W also caters to a young crowd and our unfortunate location across from the elevator meant we heard noises until late into the night. LOCATIONThe location isn't ideal unless you live downtown and are looking for a stay-cation or are specifically coming to NYC to check out the WTC, the Statue of Liberty and other downtown sights. The subway is just a few blocks away so travel is convenient. Taxis are easy to pick up. Food and nightlife options aren't the best so far downtown but it's NY so it's still a good time. Walk about 10min and you'll be in Tribeca, a very hip part of NY filled with restaurants and bars. AMENITIESWe tried the new BLT and it was amazing! Food is delicious and service is warm. We received a VIP card that among other things entitled us to 15% off all future visits. The Living Room Terrace at the W is gorgeous and drinks are well-made.

From the organic cool lobby to the outside area (bar still to open), and the room, the hotel looked great. It just opened a few months ago and hotel staff was excellent. Would definitely go there again. Room was beautiful, pretty large for NYC standards. Right around the corner from Battery Park, Wall Street, WTC, Soho and Chinatown in walking distance. Also had lunch in hotel. Great quality!","Basking Ridge, New Jersey","Debbie0146287</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Basking Ridge, New Jersey</strong>",10,5.0

Hotel is everything you could want for a good city break. Some very minor teething problems as recently opened hotel e.g. No shower caps, slippers in rooms but all issues easily remedied by hotel staff.There are plenty og good places to eat nearby, particularly Stone Street, a pedestrianised area with maybe 20 or 30 eateries available.This W compares very favourably with other W's I've stayed at and the service level is probably the best to dat.

Upon entering the ground floor where the hotel restaurant is located, I did not see any signage directing me to take the elevator to the 5th floor to check in but ultimately found my way.All the staff I met were very accommodating and helpful. Recognized Robert and Floyd from the W - Court property that was sold in spring 2010. Was given a complimentary red luggage tag which might be a promo as a part of their grand opening. The two greeters who welcome guests to the hotel and help flag taxis were very friendly. It took about 15-20 minutes to hail a cab at 7:30 pm on a Wed night so give yourself time. A couple subway stops are within a few blocks of the hotel. Acura service will not start for a couple more weeks.Was upgraded to a ""Cool Corner Room"" on the 9th floor. Bed was comfortable, room was spacious, and A/C blew nice and chilly. Only issue w the room was that the morning sunlight seeped through the blinds because of a gap in coverage. As well, Ground Zero construction seemed to start by at least 7 am. Noise may not be an issue on higher floors, but it was definitely audible on the 9th floor.","San Diego, California","aumphy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",3,4.0

Is it for everyone? Likely not, so you should be prepared for what you're going to encounter.My colleague and I were greeted by the bellmen down at the street level, but their tight black outfits suggested that we were entering a nightclub, not a hotel. The lobby is decked out with an undulating lit ceiling--which is definitely cool--but the LED's stark white tone make the place feel more like an operating room instead of a welcoming hotel entrance. (It also hurt my eyes a little, but my traveling companion had no such complaints.) Coming from Los Angeles, I expect places that look like this to be a little snooty and cold, but the front desk staff was quite helpful and friendly, even if they followed the script a little too closely. (To wit: ""Thank you, Mr. Regular Guy. I hope you enjoy your experience with us."") My biggest complaint about this place was the strong scent that they piped into the lobby (or maybe it was candles?). It was welcoming when I first arrived, but I quickly started dreading having to pass through the lobby for that reason. In addition, the hallways were quite dark, with pseudo-black lights overhead and dark wallpaper and carpet on the remaining three sides. Cool? Maybe for the rave crowd, but not for me. I had a hard time spotting my room number. Once in the room, the lighting is appropriate, although it would be great if there was some art on the walls. (You don't realize how important hotel art is until it isn't there.) The work space was adequate, the shower stall spacious, but the bathroom ventilation was not operational during my visit. In addition, the drain in the bathroom sink didn't work very well.For the future, the gal at the front desk said that they're currently dismantling the old Deutsche Bank building directly to the north, so the W should have some pretty spectacular views once the new World Trade space is complete. Specifically, the outdoor bar on the lobby-level (not yet open during my stay) will be a pretty neat place to get a drink. However, for the time being, all of that construction means that this place is pretty noisy, at all hours of the day. Requesting a room that doesn't face north might help that problem.Overall, this place strikes me as ironic performance art. It seems like all of the elements--the co-ed bathroom in the lobby, the whimsical in-room breakfast menu, the custom-designed stationery, the ever-changing elevator mats, etc etc--all poke fun at the concept of the boutique hotel instead of serving to reinforce it. So I'm left wondering: is this place beyond hip, or was it outdated even before the first guest arrived?","Santa Monica, California","theregularguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",58,3.0

Got to the hotel which is right near the WTC construction site. Before booking this hotel, you should really have a plan as to where you are going to be hanging out in NYC. This hotel is really out of the way from the touristy sites, unless you plan on hanging around the financial district (it's deserted on weekends), South Street Seaport (a 10- to 15-minute walk away), Battery Park City. There are subways close by, but still something to consider if you are not the subway type and prefer to take cabs. Also many of the rooms face the WTC construction site, a constant reminder of 9/11. Parking is available closeby for $50 (non-SUV) though I was able to find overnight parking for $25 10 blocks away at 20 Trimble Place (near Duane Street). The first lobby you get to see is pretty dark (dark walls, dark floor) and there are elevators when you first enter. Take the first set of elevators to the 5th floor to get to the reception area. There wasn't a sign telling guests where to go - I had to get out of the elevator and ask the doormen. Not sure what's on the floors between. The reception area is very pretty. The ceiling with waves of lights looks like something you'd find in a modern museum. The staff was friendly. On the reception floor are the outdoor patio bar with black and red plastic chairs and tables, an indoor sitting area with couches and an indoor bar. Cocktails were around $14 each (this is the going rate for that area, so not just at the hotel). We had a light lunch (pizza, paninis) at the outdoor bar. Outside, there are also giant wooden Jenga games for guests to play with. The next set of elevators brings guests up to their rooms. You need to have your room card ready to scan in the elevator in order to go upstairs. Got to the 14th floor where my room was. (BTW, the elevators run VERY fast - you can actually feel the G-force in your legs as it gets to the lobby) The hallways are very dark with small lights, just enough for one to see. Our room, which happened to be right in front of the elevators, was very nice. Very clean. Two queen beds enough for 3-4. The view from the room was the WTC construction site. The bathroom was very nice - no tub but a roomy shower area instead with glass doors. There is a frosty pane of glass between the shower room and the sleeping area - FYI - if you turn on the light in the middle of the night, the light reflects through the frosty glass into the sleeping area. (You can see this in one of my pictures) Others in our party did not have that frosty pane of glass in their rooms, so only certain rooms have them. Note that the humongous windows in the room open so one can actually fall out of them - note for anyone who has kids. Got back to the room pretty late and could not get to sleep. It wasn't so much the bed, which was very comfortable. But the air conditioner in the room was blasting really cold air and it sounded like a loud fan. It did that every hour it seemed. In addition to that, the elevator right outside my room was stuck/broken and making a dinging sound every 15 minutes. I called the concierge and they said that they would send someone up to check it. The dinging would stop but then would start again. This continued on until the morning. I probably could've asked to have the room changed but the person I was rooming with was still out. Also, I could hear anyone coming out of the elevators chatting away. So, in short, the hotel is very nice and the location is just okay. Hotel rate was normal for that location. Also, as with any hotel, make sure to ask for a room away from the elevators.",New York,"colmmoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",10,4.0
