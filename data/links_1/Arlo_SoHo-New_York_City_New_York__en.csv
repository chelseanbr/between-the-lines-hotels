We stayed for 5 nights and the rooms were quiet apart from a bit of external noise, housekeeping was done daily and we had no issues from that. The amenities fee was included as part of our stay and we made use of the happy hour or detox hour as they called it to have a few beers. The shop inside was useful if you fancied a snack. The hotel was a 5-10 min walk to a few different subway stops. We went to a few NBA games while we were here but didn’t feel unsafe walking back to the hotel.Check in and check out were quick and easy with no issues and we were able to store our luggage after check out as we had a later flight home.

He picked a great hotel in a great location with great amenities and great service!We arrived Saturday February 22nd - our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the pretty courtyard and proved to be a nice quiet spot away from the main roads.My husband had emailed ahead to let the hotel know it was my 50th birthday on the 25th in the hope they may do something special, unfortunately he never received a reply. However, this did not alter the fact we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.The room itself is cosy and perfect for just two, it maybe small but who needs more when you're out sightseeing all day! Each day we returned to a nice clean room, which was most welcoming after a day pounding the streets of NYC!Harold's bar has happy hour between 5:30-7:00pm and it was lovely to enjoy a free beer or glass of wine before dinner. This is covered under the resort fee you pay but a nice thing to do.Another compliment is the hotel smells great!!!!

Stayed here for 4 nights with my teenage daughter who has been badgering me to come to New York for a while. Really nervous about travelling so far and being disappointed by our accommodation but I need not have worried. I had read on here that the rooms can be a tad 'compact' , but we were really lucky to get an end of corridor corner room that was a bit bigger and included a couple of chairs and a little table by the huge window. Looked out onto the rear courtyard but didn't mind because we didn't hear any street noise at night. The bed was really comfy and the room nice and warm. Some really nice features and touches in the room- good quality body wash, shampoo and conditioner in the shower, toothbrush/paste provided, mini fridge, USB charging points, free good quality wifi and a welcome half bottle of wine for a tired mum! .Good sized TV. Did lack space for hanging/putting clothes so we pretty much lived out of our cases but for 4 nights we didn't mind. Really missed having a kettle but we did take a travel one and got some milk/coffee/biscuits from a shop. The shower and toilet are not in a separate room but in a sort of cubicle with frosted glass. It does lack a bit of privacy especially for a teenage girl in a room with her mum. Felt the frosting wasn't quite enough and maybe a curtain dividing that end of the room would at least help. However, we coped. Didn't use the restaurant or bar because we like to explore a bit so we went out to eat. The area around the hotel has a few nice places to eat, Whitman's burgers and an Italian over the road. Felt really safe in the neighbourhood even after dark. A great base for exploring, within walking distance are the world trade centre and 9/11 memorial, statten island ferry, museum of the American indian, FDNY museum and Brooklyn bridge. A short walk along canal street is the subway station that links to all the rest the city has to offer. The hotel staff were very friendly and dealt with our broken remote control very quickly. Room was cleaned daily and water in fridge restocked. Elevators were fast and never busy. Whole place clean. No noise from other guests. Really trendy, modern and boutique style. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if we ever come to New York again.","Bradford, United Kingdom","Katy R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bradford, United Kingdom</strong>",18,5.0

The lobby has Dylan’s candy and a great lobby, outside area, rooftop bar and restaurant. Every night happy hour with free wine, beer and snacks. The restaurant was great ( I am a food snob). The Breakfast buffet was amazing for $24 and included tons of options. The Cobb salad and pizza great too. The room itself is simple and small, not a lot of storage space, but clean, modern and a lot of light. The location of the hotel is easy to access bc right near holland tunnel.

The Metro runs straight into uptown New York. We saw everything ( well not EVERYTHING, but all the ‘must see’ tourist stuff without having to swap Metro lines, so it made everything very easy.

After 10 minutes we were informed that this was now being changed to a twin room (which we didn't mind as its for one night) for one night and the remaining two nights we would be upgraded to the best they could get on the 10th floor... after another 5-10 minutes in reception we were asked if we wouldn't mind going for a drink in the bar as they needed to sort somethings outs, we finally got our keys to the room after about an hour of walking through the doors. We were on the 10th floor so figured they must have got something sorted, we could not believe it when we walked in and found out they had put us in a accessible bunk room which left us speechless and disappointed. The last time I slept on a bunk bed was on when I was on operations in Afghanistan in 06 and then it was only until we moved down to our main FOB. My wife how ever has never slept on one so was even more upset and disappointed than myself. The next morning we were advised to go to reception and confirm that we wished to change so I was at reception at 7.00am to say that we most certainly wished to change and that we would get the key after we returned later that day, when we returned it was the same guy who signed us in the previous night and we got the sense that he knew that something was a miss and he tried to change the room while we were stood there before we had actually seen it but was unable to so we got the the room on the 7th floor and it turned out to be a queen room which we should have had in the first place.So the question is are there first come first served on rooms even if you have paid for themI think the the saving grace for this hotel is that it really is a nice hotel and the guy on reception Richard was fantastic and really was trying to help us so many thanks to him.",,DDinNYC,1,1.0

The numerous areas to enjoy downstairs are so festive and beautifully decorated for the holidays. Many of the rooms are very small but there are so many great spots downstairs to work or relax and the beds are very comfortable. (You can also book a larger room and some even have terraces.) They have come up with so many creative ways to get guests to mingle, including their complimentary weekday digital detox hour. So good!! You can reserve an outdoor cabin. I stopped by to see one that friends I met at the hotel reserved. I felt like I was tucked away on a ski mountain, not in an NYC courtyard. So magical! The beds are comfortable and the soundproofing is amazing, which is such a gift in city hotels! I did not hear any noise at all in either of my courtyard rooms. (I switched rooms when I had a window draft issue in my first one on an extremely cold night...they found a solution that made me want to shout from the rooftops about how amazing this place is.)

From dropping our bags off early to calling us a car to take us back to JFK. Nothing was too much trouble. All fairly standard stuff but it was done well. All smiles and general good nature made us feel very welcome. The hotel lobby leads onto a lovely lounge and bar area with restaurant at the back. We didn't eat here so can't comment further but the cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced. The snacks that were available in the lobby (24 hours) are extortionately priced though. 21 dollars for three packets of crisps and a coke! I guess that's what happens when you have a captive audience. Rooms were great for our purposes. They're small but have everything you need and the shower is great. Not the sort of room you would lounge around in, but why would you when you've got New York to explore. Comfortable beds and amazingly quiet considering the location. Contact throughout our stay was superb as well. Emails were sent if the do not disturb sign was up and the room therefore not serviced, just to make sure it wasn't a mistake.

There were two days without hot water. While I understand that things happen with boilers (not ideal but things happen) the complete lack of communication to guests was unacceptable. Anything from an email acknowledging the issue/making customers aware of it to a call or even a note of apology would have gone a long way but instead it took me calling or stopping but the desk to find out that it was a hotel-wide issue. On top of that, housekeeping seems to be operating on autopilot and not paying attention at all. I used the glasses in the room the first night and left the dirty glasses in the sink. They were still there when I returned Monday evening so I set them in the hall assuming that housekeeping would replace. They never did until I spoke to the front desk on Wednesday. Additionally, the phone in the room was malfunctioning causing the screen to rapidly flicker making sleeping with it on the cradle next to impossible. It was something that was VERY obvious but housekeeping never called maintenance or replaced it. I had to ask the front desk to replace it on Wednesday. Lastly, I woke Tuesday to a tear in the bottom sheet that, again, was very obvious. I returned to the room Tuesday night and the same torn sheet was still on the bed! I don't know budget hotels that have such bad service. Again, I had to ask the front desk to replace it on Wednesday. All in all, the majority of the front desk and lobby team were exceptional. Very polite and very prompt. A good friend who works for a hotel group in NY noted about the woman with curly hair in the lobby that she'd hire her in an instant because of how great she was with guests. She is also the person who fixed the issues with my room and comped me coffee from the lobby. However, when I was departing on Sunday afternoon I asked one of the front desk guys if I could reclaim my luggage and he passed my ticket off to someone else and went about his business. All in all, it took me close to 45-min to get my bags back causing me to miss a flight by 3 minutes and have to stay overnight at JFK.

But at night you are away from the craziness and noise in a romantic space that envelopes you. The rooms are clean, and efficient. They make good use of space so it works. Our room had a large hot shower and King size bed. While it was cold outside, the room temp was perfect and quiet. No fan or annoying hum of an air-conditioner. A large window brought in natural light, but two powered screens (one transparent, one thick made the room private and restful. And there are lots of interesting spaces on the ground floor and terrace for chatting or working on the computer. For the holidays, Santa stopped by with spiced cider and treats and there were craft activities for the children. Happy hour goodies helped transition from day to night. The restaurant is amazing-- such interesting flavors- who knew carrots could taste so good. Also try the octopus ceviche.

Negatives: the bathroom and location. There are no walls providing you with privacy in the bathroom. All the room provides is frosted glass dividing the bathroom from the bed. So, you can see and hear whomever you may be sharing a room with take care of business. It felt like a prison cell as I had to ask my partner to give me a courtesy flush. I get this is NYC and I’ve experienced this will lesser priced hotels. The problem I had is that there is NO mention of this issue in the room descriptions. For the exact same type of room w no-privacy bathroom, you could stay at the Yhotel and save $100 a night. Also, I was no a fan of the location. The hotel is situated very close to the busy intersection heading into the tunnel towards NJ. Given this, it’s loud, congested and made navigated in and around the area difficult.

Great for relaxing after city hikes. We had good cocktails in the bar. Happy hour at Harold’s was a plus with complementary beer/wine for hotel guests. In general, Arlo Soho had a good vibe. We stayed in a “Queen Alcove” room. The room was pretty good, but windows needed sound proofing and weather proofing. Street noise was real, the bass from the gym across the street was notable, but they closed down before bedtime and it wasn’t too much of a problem. The room is small, as expected and anticipated for an NYC micro-hotel type place. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. We slept well. The bathroom had a nifty lay out, incorporated into the room with a frosted sliding door. Though it had a trendy look, some items were also a bit worn - hooks over the sink were starting to pull from the wall, the shower curtain was in need of replacing. We didn’t love the location of the hotel. It was a decent jumping off point for adventures in Chelsea, Soho, Little Italy and Chinatown, but wasn’t in the middle of anything either and the surrounding area is fairly nondescript. The price was responsible for NYC and fit the hotel. After accounting for all the various taxes, fees and the like the cost for a mid-November weekend was $288 a night. Overall, we’d recommend this hotel, but didn’t leave gushing about the experience either.","Concord, New Hampshire","NHJimmy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Concord, New Hampshire</strong>",31,4.0

As most business people know the routine can get old and you start missing some sense of home after awhile. My team told me about Arlo Soho and I jumped on it as it was right next to my office and it's a wonderful hotel. However, I keep coming back because of a individual named Clu. Tucked around the corner from the front doors is a small bodega with incredible food and one of the KINDEST people I have ever met. His name is Clu..always armed with a smile and he always remembers the people he helps. I would be remiss if I did not share an encounter with Clu that will stay with me for years to come. After a 16 hour day, exhaustion, and coupled with rough news I dragged myself to the bodega around 1130PM for some tea before I headed to my room. A little teary I stood quiet waiting for my turn and I hear Clu asked ""everything ok?""...I smiled and simply said rough day. He smiled and handed me my tea and wished me a better day. It was the second night that I made my usual run for tea that I hear ""was today better?"" ..it was Clu and not only did he remember me and my bad day but my tea was waiting. We chatted for 15 minutes learning about eachother... where we came from..why I was in NY..and most of all it was the sense of friendship that made my week. In a fast paced city like NY we pass by one another never giving a second thought to how someone might be doing. But Clu slowed that pace down and humanized a moment I will be forever grateful for. For me Arlo Soho is not just a hotel..its a second home for the next several months and I have to be honest..I come back to see my friend Clu because it makes this travel a little less tough being away from my daughter knowing there is always a friendly face each day.

A Dylan's Candy Wall and great grab and go food makes this a ""work late"" gem.Recently, I had a client who gave me 24 hours to find a place to host a birthday party for over two hundred people. Enter my personal super hero, Jen Roman, Event manager. In no time flat I had a tour of the location, a price quoted and approvals for the rooftop and even a menu of what could be served to the guests. Arlo anywhere has my business. Knowing I and my clients are in good and responsive hands, is all the peace of mind I need.Need to get work done while traveling? The lobby has been transformed into a comfy living room with plenty of outlets to kick back and get work done. Sit indoors or out, even in Winter!

The rooftop bar is a fabulous asset - we started every evening there and had a great time every time (and our NY friends were really happy to come and meet us there because it's such a good spot). Be warned, though - service can be slow when it's busy (although that's understandable). Accommodation? OK, let's be honest the rooms here are small and with two people in them it's tight with luggage, but the design optimises the space and the hotel doesn't hide any of this in its room descriptions or photography.

During the check in ""conversation"" we were told 35$ additional would be charged PER NIGHT, which was absolutely not mentioned at all in the reservation confirmation or rates diplayed on the 3rd party site. Upon finalising the check in, we arrived to a room that wasn't in proper conditions (the bed was undone and the whole bedframe was misplaced in the middle of the room). We were told this room was previously used to ""store"" other guests baggage and thus the bed had been moved to make some space. This would have been fine, but the least they could have done is to put things back in place and tidy the space up before handing over the room. On top of that the rooms (we were given a new room upon complaining about the initially assigned one) are extremely small for the price, and if you add the 35$ extra they charge aside from the prices displayed on booking.com, it definitely made it even a worse value-for-money experience. Lastly, check out coudn't have been more absurd. There were multiple charges made to the card without prior notice and for various concepts and amounts, however each ""concept"" was broken down into multiple sub-charges which made it extremely difficult to estimate total amounts paid per concept and amounts we could expect to be returned. Example: concept A charge was 50$, instead of having 1 unique 50$ charge, there were 5 charges on the card, of 5$, 10$, 23$, 8$ & 4$. It absolutely made no sense at all. Overall, really bad experience, literally the only good thing was the location, and there were plenty of other hotels around of the same category and price range.",,eleh00,1,1.0

Upon arrival, the energy in the lobby was amazing & the staff was so upbeat & welcoming, specifically David & John. Once they realized we were repeat guests, they were quick to offer us a room upgrade along 2 drink coupons. That was so unexpected & incredibly sweet of them. You can tell how they (along with the rest of the staff) are so committed to their work & really enjoy what they do. They were one of the real reasons our stay was so amazing. We absolutely love how cozy & comfortable the rooms are. They thought of absolutely everything you need with so many special touches & so creative with a smaller space. We love how the window takes up the entire wall, creating such a bright, warm space. They have a steamer, dryer, toiletries, lots of nooks & crannies for storage & even an umbrella in case it rains (thank goodness because we needed it one day).The lobby/bar area is full of energy with many areas to sit, relax, enjoy a drink or do computer work. There was even a pop-up shop & private event that was happening that was cool to see. We also got to enjoy the rooftop lounge since the last time we visited it was cold. It was packed & no seating, but still enjoyed a great drink, the atmosphere & views. The only weird thing was we had to go to the inside bar to get our drinks even though there was a bartender making drinks at the outside bar, but that didn’t damper our enjoyment. It just seemed a bit disorganized between bartender, wait staff & manager, but they were friendly.The coolest space & what makes this hotel so unique is the courtyard & the pop-up installations they do. This time was a nod to Woodstock 50 Years & Summer of Love. It was so vibrant, fun, imaginative & whimsical! I can’t wait to come back tosee the next installation!This is the ONLY hotel we will stay when we come to NYC because they always have something unique going on & you just never know what to expect…. well, you will DEFINITELY expect fantastic staff, a great room & great vibe!","Salem, Massachusetts","dianecapozzi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salem, Massachusetts</strong>",20,5.0

We came early, around 10am, so check in was not possible as it was too early. Which is fine and which we knew, so we just dropped our luggage. We came back two hours after check in time, but still, one of the rooms were not ready. They mentioned they gave it to another person who checked in at 3pm - although we were there at 10am. They should have taken a note.My room was still full of trash when I entered, half full paperclip with could coffee, empty bottles and a note for the former guest... So I went down again and got a new room. My friend who's room was not ready dropped her luggage into my room as she needed to change before dinner. After I cam back from dinner at around 10pm I tried to get her luggage transferred from my room to her room - the receptionist said ""I'll be up I 5 minutes and do that"". No one showed up, after 30 min. I called reception, I explained to the lady on the phone and she promised to send someone immediately - no one came. So after an hour I went down to reception, but no one was there. So I went to bed as it was already late. My friend didn't get her luggage until the next morning. There were a few more things which I don't go into detail here. Overall they should not say they do something when they don't. At check out my invoice was not ready so right now I am waiting to get it via email - also here they promised ""you'll get in within 30 minutes via email"". I still son'z have it 2 hours later.

Isabella really took the time to make sure we had everything we needed for a long and comfortable stay. She was also very helpful when it came time to print some important company docs and really came through when I needed a parcel that arrived at the hotel delivered to another location. Overall she went above and beyond for us and really solidified our love for the Arlo, which is why we don't stay anywhere else.Rooms are compact but provide everything you need and the location is perfect- close to a Trader Joe's and several great restaurants.Highlight of the trip was the excellent service we received from Dree at the rooftop bar. He was on point every night and super personable, creating a relaxed environment for us to chill and enjoy the view of the city.

Very friendly and efficient and clearly intent on providing the best possible service. I only got one name - Isabella - but everyone at the desk was on point. We loved the common areas on the ground floor and the rooftop terrace was spectacular. Service in the bars and restaurants was very good and the food in Harold's was delicious. The ""Digital Detox"" in Harold's, with unlimited complimentary wine and beer was a big hit and the quality of the wine offered was surprisingly good. I've seen lots of comments on the size of the guestrooms but the room size is fine (and bigger than other NY hotel rooms we have experienced). The room overlooked Hudson Square and it was bright and well appointed. Overall the hotel had a really positive vibe and everyone was so upbeat. We were left with the overall impression that the Arlo SoHo leadership team has a perfect handle on what the hotel guest experience should look like and their team buys into this and executes it flawlessly.

Bit disappointed that hotel didn't acknowledge that in any way, despite me emailing them up front. Nevertheless the staff were all very nice and friendly at all times, from the housekeeping to front of house. Our room was a little larger than the std shoebox format, having a small coffee table and chairs. It actually wasn't any smaller than many European hotel rooms that we have stayed in.Location was for me the best point. Arlo sits on the edge of Soho/Tribeca/Greenwich. It's 10 mins walk to all 3, and a couple more and you are on the riverside which is stunning in itself. I highly recommend staying in this part of town if your want a quieter, more laid back experience. I love this area! From the hotel we walked easily to and across the Brooklyn Bridge, 911 memorial, Staten Island Ferry etc. Canal Street subway stations (5mins walk) link you to the city with ease.oh...Lobby smells amazing !

If the room leaves you feeling claustrophobic, there are so many spots to hangout in the building. A short walk to the West Village and everything cool about SOHO.

It’s a little misleading, because there’s nowhere on the website that accommodates specific wants. Other than that, the room looked pretty much like what we expected. However, they could do a better job at keeping the rooms clean, considering the size. We found a thick layer of dust in multiple locations around the room. Also, my partner and I have stayed at micro hotel rooms in the city before, and we both felt that the lack of toilet privacy at Arlo was slightly embarrassing at times. On Saturday we left the room at around 11am, and arrived back at the hotel roughly around 6pm. By the time we got back, the room service still had not cleaned the room. Which wasn’t a huge deal, but when we tried to call room service for more towels and toilet paper, even the phone didn’t work. So we had to go down to guest service to ask. One more thing that was disappointing was the rooftop bar. We were really excited to spend some time up there, but the hotel allowsso many people who are not guests to go up, and there is barely enough room to mingle, yet alone find a seat. I understand that it’s also a business for outsiders, but we felt that hotel guests should have more priority there. The hotel might want to consider only allowing a certain capacity of outside guests separately from the people with room cards if it is that busy. We did enjoy certain things about Arlo Soho.

Only criticism was it was tough getting through on Canal street during rush hour, however the stay at the hotel itself was excellent. Check in was a breeze. We got the special Rose room rate with a bottle of wine included. The room itself is as advertised, small but clean and quiet. Shower stall was great with great water pressure. We initially had a problem with TV reception which was quickly addressed by maintenance. Though the room may be cozy, there is plenty of room to lounge on the ground floor, a bar, a seating area, a courtyard with a couple of greenhouse covered picnic tables around a vintage VW bug and a large indoor table to do work and to watch TV. The bar on the first floor served great apps and drinks and the happy hour with free wine and beer was much appreciated. WiFi worked well. The roof top bar is also as advertised- great view of the Hudson and NJ. It fills up quickly so if you have a larger party would call as early as you can to get reservations. We borrowed the complimentary bicycles one day and took a ride up the Hudson river park and really had a great excursion. SOHO, Little Italy and the Village are only a few blocks away with their attendant restaurants and boutiques.

And the staff matters a lot, too. In our one night experience, the design, comfort and functionality of our stay was not good, but the staff were all fantastic.We booked a one-night stay through Tablet, which provided us an upgrade from a Queen room to a King room, plus late check-out. We called ahead to tell them we'd be arriving late and got there probably around 10:30 p.m. We knew our room would be small and in fact have stayed at a number of NYC hotels where the rooms were tiny but were still comfortable, so size didn't concern us. Unfortunately, there were so many things wrong with our room that it was not a comfortable stay. Some of the issues were design-related and some were maintenance-related. Here is a list:-- When we opened the door an immediate musty smell hit us. It wasn't exactly a moldy or mildewy odor (or we would have walked right out) but it was just sort of humid and not fresh smelling. We turned up the a/c and the a/c fan and hoped it would get better while we unpacked. The toilet and shower is glass-enclosed and part of the actual room space, so we also figured that might have something to do with the musty odor, plus it was almost 11 p.m. and we were tired and didn't want to go back downstairs. We tried opening a window but the traffic noise from the Holland Tunnel made it impossible to keep the window open.-- The king bed was up on a wooden platform with a drawer and a shelf underneath and kind of ""built into"" the space so that the end of the bed was touching the wooden ""wall"" where the TV was mounted and one side of the bed was up against the windows. When I say ""up against"" I mean that there literally was no space between the side of the bed and the window so that my hubby sleeping on that side literally had to crawl over me to get down to go to the bathroom. -- The huge TV mounted on the wooden wall of the ""cabinet"" we were to sleep in did not work. It just showed channel listings for each channel and a black screen, no matter what channel we chose. I called to report this/get it fixed and the phone reception to the staff member answering was such that you could hear only every other word. The staff member acknowledged this and apologized as she had the problem too. She promised to send someone up to fix the TV. We waited for about a half hour and then just decided to forget it as we wanted to go to sleep, so my hubby called down and canceled the service call.-- There was another unusual and not happy aspect to the bed. It seems that the mattress was about six inches too short for the wooden platform/cabinet it lives in, so there were two long triangular wedges placed in the six-inch space between the head of the mattress and the wooden wall of the cabinet, underneath our bed pillows. The wedges were covered in a tweedy fabric you might find on upholstery. Not only did this put the pillows at an uncomfortable angle for me but frankly I found this unsanitary as I only wondered whether they change the tweedy fabric covering the wedges for every guest? So I made sure not to turn my bed pillows over when sleeping. I have never seen this anywhere, period. There has to be a better way to deal with this, at the very least put the wedges at the foot of the mattress maybe, but it was an icky detail for me. -- In the morning the musty smell was finally gone. I went to take a shower in the glassed-in enclosure and tried to put the shower curtain up -- it is a nylon sheet with buttonholes that are supposed to go over metal pegs to hold it up, but the buttonhole that was supposed to go over the peg in order to keep the curtain up was too big and I was unable to attach it -- it kept just falling off. So that meant my little shower resulted in water all over the floor of the toilet area, even onto the floor near the front door. Also, the drain in the shower was slow and the ledge to keep water in wasn't that high, so that could have also contributed to me mopping up water all over the floor after my shower. Thank goodness hubby showered at the club after his spin class!So there were a lot of problems. I do have to say that the room looked very clean (in spite of the musty smell), thankfully. I would have given this experience one or two stars if it wasn't for the fact that the staff members were all just wonderful! Everyone, from the front desk person to the guy who sold us our beverages at their ""bodega"" to the woman who answered my phone call about the TV were all really engaged, friendly, and service-oriented. While I went to a handbag sale to meet up with a friend, my hubby ended up talking to the operations manager about our experience and he found that manager very responsive and listened well with concern, reflecting back what he had heard my hubby tell him (there must be some great service training here). The operations manager gave us a refund for 50% of our stay and hotel charges, which was very much appreciated given our experience.We stay at a lot of NYC hotels for little ""staycations"" here and there, and I'm not sure if I would want to give this place another try. If their rooms were as great as their staff I wouldn't hesitate to return.","Mahwah, New Jersey","AnneC229</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mahwah, New Jersey</strong>",401,3.0

The air conditioning was automatically programmed to switch to fan mode after about 20 min, and will not turn back on to cooling mode unless you manually shut of the system, wait, and turn it on again. We called the front desk to complain after we woke up the next morning in a sweat because our room was over 80 degrees. A kind bldg. engineer came up to ""fix"" it, but after it only worked temporarily again, we asked the front desk if it was programmed to turn off after a while and he confirmed. He said something to the effect of ""since there are so many rooms in the building it's not possible to have the air conditioning running all the time."" As a licensed architect with 12 years experience, I can confidently say that the system capability is only limited by the hotel management who is making money off the literal sweat of its guests in the name of being environmentally friendly. For the amount of money we paid to stay at a ""luxury"" hotel which clearly states that the rooms are air conditioned, we felt like we had been scammed.

While the rooms are Arlo are clean and modern, they bring new meaning to the definition of small. Even by NYC standards, these rooms are tiny. I booked a King Courtyard room and was surprised to discover the bed is wedged into a corner and could only be entered from 1 side. There wasn't even space for a laptop, I had to take video calls while sitting in bed. In any case, I was here for business and wasn't spending much time at the hotel apart from sleeping. For that reason, I was surprised to discover a $31 / night ""Urban Fee"" on my credit card at checkout. I complained to the hotel about this and was met with this response: ""The urban fee is our mandatory facility fee. It covers all of amenities in the hotel."" The reality is that this fee represents no real value to the guest and is just a poorly veiled strategy to increase ADR. If the fee is mandatory and charged to all guests, then why isn't it a part of your nightly rate? These sneaky tactics alone is enough to keep me from staying here again on future NYC trips. In addition, long lines for the elevators and front desk made it clear that ARLO packs in guests like sardines. I expect more at a place charging $350 + night PLUS fees.","San Francisco, California","maggioant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",12,2.0

I had SO many positive experiences here. I arrived late on a Friday night with no plans. I wanted to enjoy this part of NYC before my business trip started on Sunday in Brooklyn. I was suddenly transported to an amazing rooftop party! I decided around midnight that I needed dinner, and the staff helped recommend a deli in walking distance. There was a steady downpour.. thankfully there was an umbrella in the hotel room! The hotel room was quaint, but everything was sparkling clean and I had everything I needed. I had a nice view of the interior courtyard. I actually had to laugh at the functionality of the bathroom and shower.. it was so European! I appreciated the updated technology and didn't mind the functional (if sparse) closet space. The next morning, it was raining, so I cancelled my morning plans. I noted that there was a restaurant downstairs if I chose to have breakfast. I really enjoyed all of the communal spaces.. I felt like I was solo, but not alone. I wandered down to the Hudson River and the 9/11 museum.. It was a nice walk but I took an Uber back. I enjoyed the tents, ice cream, and so many other cute features that come with this space! I was so happy with how they came in under compared to other hotels I'd initially considered, but didn't skimp on quality. The vibe of the clientele, whether staying or coming in to party on the rooftop, was very chill. I found all of the staff beyond helpful.I'm so glad I stayed here, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is okay with a small room for sleeping and wants to maximize experiences.","Los Angeles, California","PortiaJP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,5.0

I loved the common spaces in the hotel, such as the roof bar, Harold's, working areas etc. The guest happy hour with free beer/wine is a nice touch as well. However, I can't give this place above a 3 star because of the room. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC, so I know they are going to be on the smaller side. I just wasn't expecting the toilet to basically be in the shower and to be unable to walk around my bed without nailing my shins in the process. Not having a true closet or drawers to unpack for a longer stay was just not comfortable. I also had issues with the temperature in my room. I would return after a long day of meetings and it would be 78 degrees, which is an inferno in a room this tiny. Plus, like others mentioned, I'm not sure I would even be comfortable staying with my spouse; there is zero privacy. I think this hotel is best suited for single leisure travelers who don't plan to be in their room at lot or for a 1 or 2 nights stay tops.

This makes accessing anything from your case clumsy and slow (especially at night!) Remember there are no drawers to put clothes either so don’t even imagine you can ‘unpack’.All of the above is described by Arlo as “a micro concept”. Well, it’s a failed concept, it does not do the bare minimum that any hotel should achieve, let alone one with this price tag.Add to all of this the $35 daily charge for “free” WiFi, happy hour, bicycles etc. and you realise that this concept is designed with profit, not guests in mind.As I sat listening to the steady drip of water on the room ceiling, keeping me awake at night, I determined to write a review, to advise future guests of what they should expect.So now you have been warned.

The “movie night” that’s pointless because no one can hear it over the crap music.There is a happy hour if you want bad Chardonnay or some terrible red accompanied by a platter of food so small only a few people get near it. Including nil cutlery or napkins. The second night I went was even worse than the first. Included about 8 or 10 hotel guest mulling about trying to get near the food which included a dip with nothing to dip into it. I went 3 times and it was rubbish.

It happens to the best of us! Here are my two cents on why you should stay at Arlo SoHo.Location: Once you've decided you want to stay in Manhattan ('cause Brooklyn is also a great choice), you may want to stay in the Lower side - away from the over crowded and Midtown tourist traps. Trendy SoHo is a great option & Arlo SoHo is close to many great restaurants and shopping venues. There's also a couple subway stations within a quick 6min walk. Staff: Super friendly, all smiles and attentive. Complimentary drinks: I probably should've started with this one, huh!? They serve a daily almost 2hrs long open bar including wine, beer & gin cocktails AND hors d'oeuvres.Rooms: Modern, clean & functional. But small. I know, it's NY and almost all accommodations tend to be on the smaller size, but having some additional in room space would've swayed me to a 5/5 rating. There's plenty of other common areas you can stretch, read a book or even work if it makes you feel better. There's also other onsite amenities to enhance your stay such as a restaurant and rooftop bar.",,emer_views,10,4.0

Also the design of the rooms. I knew it would be small but no bedside table and just a couple of hangers....? Also I think the design of having the bathroom basically in the room but with a glass partition was impractical. The sliding door doesn’t actually shut off the bathroom so there’s not much privacy if there’s two of you in a room. Also the lack of ventilation means the room starts to get musty once you’ve showered. There is AC but it was v loud for such a small room - like a helicopter taking off. Had to turn it off at night.

And you would know that anything can happen during the travels. When we booked this hotel two weeks ago, me and my boyfriend had to make last minute changes in our itinerary. Like really last minute. Arlo staff was extremely helpful and understanding and did everything to accommodate our request. We communicated with few people at the front desk and with two managers - everyone on top of customer service. Separate thanks to Chad who finalized our request and found compromise suitable to both sides.Apart from our situation, hotel was really cool and designed with unusual solutions - both in the rooms and in common areas where everyone comes to work. They encourage people to spend less time in the room and hang out in shared space instead. In the evening there's a happy hour where guests are encouraged to leave their phones aside for an hour or two and actually meet people and have verbal communication - such a rare these days when people just talk via the phone applications!Definitely recommend this hotel for those who enjoys creative spaces, great location, fun crowd - and all of it for very moderate price!Great travels everyone!",,Lavrikovanastya,0,5.0

However once settled in, you realise the room is packed with everything you'll need. I understand why people would complain about the shower and toilet being within the room (no seperate bathroom, just devided by smoked glass screen.)However these rooms aren't designed to spend a lot of time in them, after all your in NYC!But it's the rest of the hotel is where it shines. The communal areas are packed with desks, tables with sockets / USB ports, powerful Wi-Fi, bars, 24/7 shop, a roof top bar.The city tax covers use of a nearby gym and a hour and half of free drinks and nibbles in the restaurant, where the atmosphere is fantastic.

The decor is “ Danish or Scandinavian “ inspired and so clean and comfortable, with great common areas for socializing and computing. This hotel smells great too, the scent of “Deep Wood” also greets you as you enter the hotel. We arrived early and was able to check in right away. I really wanted to give Arlo 5stars, but felt the overnight parking was expensive, we were told on the phone it would be $45, but in fact it was $55. The bed (super comfortable) was pretty much against the window that faced the street, I found it cold and drafty on that side of the bed, even with the thermostat set to 73, and at times noisey...and lastly the breakfast buffet at Harold’s was overpriced at $24 per person.We will definitely choose Arlo again for future stays!","New Bedford, Massachusetts","stebenunes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Bedford, Massachusetts</strong>",0,4.0

Right in front of the bed was the toilet and next to that the shower. only thing separating the toilet and bed was a sliding door which you can see though, much as a love my husband don't want to see him emptying his bowels! The shower curtain is pointless the entire floor ended up wet when you take a shower. The bed is comfy, pillows are little too soft, the bedding (if that's what you call it) was just a quilt placed between 2 flat sheets nothing to keep it in place. The room was either too hot or too cold, if you had it the air con on, it would turn itself on and off all night, even switched off you got a draft from the window - possibly not sealed correctly which resulted in condensation on the windows majority of the time.Doesnt offer tea & coffee which is pretty much standard these days - the on site bodega charges $5 for a cup of tea - ridiculous even starbucks is cheaper! I didnt find the staff to be particular warm and friendly, every time you entered the hotel they rarely looked up from the computer screens. More like entering Hollister than a hotel! We booked the Arlo based on the reviews and the fact at the time of booking they didnt have an additional fee like most hotels, to which they have since introduced, given we didn't pay this fee we weren't given any of the benefits which is disappointing given they do include a small discount in the overpriced restaurant and bodega! All cliental should be given these benefits as it isn't our fault you decided to induced after booking, also some of the things included in the fee such as bike hire was already free before the fee was introduced, so really isn't an added benefit! The fee I believe is around $32 per day....you don't actually get much for it just another way to make more money which depending on the length of your stay can add up!! We wouldn't stay at this hotel again, personally I would say it is ideal for the 'young' crowd, people who spend most of the time behind a computer, not for people who like a little human interaction. Upon check out we weren't even asked about our stay, just I'll email the bill. Also don't book hotel transfer via the hotel - overpriced get the train or book elsewhere - save a fortune.

The room was small, which is no secret, but it was thoughtfully designed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the amenities in the room were top notch. I loved that I could chrome cast to the tv to watch Netflix while I was getting ready to head to work in the morning. My only complaint was the draft from the windows. The bed was very close to the window (which is neat and part of the design) but even with the shades drawn there was still a bit of a draft coming up off Canal Street (which my room faced.) It wasn’t enough to make a big deal about but I could see how it might be an issue for somebody who gets cold easily. I’m thoroughly impressed with Arlo and hope to be back again soon.

We stayed in a courtyard view room with a queen bed.The Good:-Staff at the front desk was very welcoming and pleasant to dealt with.-The hotel lobby, bar, ""library""/lounge, and outdoor area are modern, beautiful, and relaxing spaces to spend some time in - to the point where you'd almost just want to hang out there and not leave the hotel. The bar had fantastic drinks and delicious small plates. My wife and I didn't eat at the restaurant or go to the roof bar as we had other plans, but I have no doubt they would have been excellent spots to visit.-The room - while small - was a nice, cozy space fit with everything required for a short stay in NYC. The bed was comfortable, lighting was just right, the TV was new. We visit the city to go out, not to spend all of our time in our room, so the size wasn't bothersome. I mean, how much square footage do you really need?-Fast elevators. Seems silly, but I've stayed places where it would take what felt like an eternity to get up to your room.The Cons:-I know I just said I didn't mind the size of the room - and I still don't - but there were a couple small details that annoyed me. First of all, the fact that the bathroom door is just a sliding glass door that suppresses literally ZERO sound is irritating. Not to mention, even when it's all the way closed, you can still see in to the bathroom through a crack. There's almost no privacy when using it. The other thing that was a little just a minor inconvenience was the fact that the space between the front of the bed and the TV was just a little too small to make walking to the other side of the bed more difficult.-I'm not sure if it was a surprise or if I just didn't read the fine print well enough when I booked, but we had to pay an ""urban fee"" for each night. I'm still not entirely sure what this was for, but was kind of annoyed that this extra fee was tacked on.-It may be kind of unfair to include this as a con as it's to be expected in NYC, but you have to pay $55 per 24 hour period to have your car parked in a garage (with no in-and-out privileges). Fortunately there is a valet service that will park it for you. We had to wait about 20-30 minutes for them to get the car on the day of check out, but we called ahead prior to leaving our room and it wasn't really a big deal. I just wanted to mention this because parking is usually one of the first things I look at when searching for a place to stay in the city.Overall I really enjoyed this hotel. I know I gave it 4 stars, but really it's closer to 5. Would certainly stay here again.","Syracuse, New York","315_BGW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>",4,4.0

It's in a near perfect New York location. The hotel is immaculately clean, and hip without being pretentious. The front desk staff was warm, friendly and went out of the way to be kind. It sets the stage for every interaction at the hotel. I love the common areas, especially the Soho Bodega/Dylan's Candy Bar in the front, and the Lobby Bar, with its free happy hour for guests, that was packed. It was the perfect way to mingle with other guests. The hotel describes the rooms as ""micro guest rooms that combine flexible, modern furniture with efficient storage spaces and a range of playful touches."" It's true. The rooms are great. Very thoughtfully designed but micro means tiny. It was great for me as I was alone but I do wonder how a couple would have fit into the space. The only problem I had with the hotel is there wasn't an on-site gym. However, they do offer off-site access to gyms and classes for which they charge an Urban Fee, an additional $29.00 fee per night, plus tax. That fee covers things like wi-fi, the happy hour, and local and domestic phone calls. I hate this new phenomenon of Urban Fees many hotels are doing. Mostly they charge for things other hotels provide for free like wi-fi, and gym access, or things you don't need like the happy hour which was cool but voluntary, and who uses phones at hotels when everyone has a cell? All in all, I loved the Arlo. I'd definitely stay there again. Even with its shortcomings, room size and the Urban Fee, the style of the hotel and the service makes up for it.","Los Angeles, California","MarqueeMarc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",7,4.0

They even have their own bikes you can borrow, for goodness sake!And when we got engaged the staff were so nice to gift us some goodies in congratulations. Oh, and if you gym regularly they have a deal with a nearby NYC gym and you can get a pass to use it. I love the location too. You’re away from the hubbub of midtown and strolling around SoHo of an evening is calming and enjoyable with a number of unique places to eat. I’d go back in a heartbeat.

For this, guests were allowed to use the restaurant (which was closed for an event), have two water bottles in the room and free Wi-Fi. Talk about pricy water….  A ridiculously small room awaited me. One in which, you have to climb over your suitcase in order to get into bed-kind. The shower had a curtain shower- not door (of course from recycled materials) yet all water was flowing into toilet area and sink was outside of the room. There was no room for storage, no closet or drawers – just a rack with 4 hangers, and overall the feeling was of being in shoebox. However, I was willing o over look all this if only my door would close. Yet it would not…I went down again to find a pleasant guy and explained to him that I have to go out to a business meeting and that I cannot stay in a room that its door will not fully close. I asked that they either fix the door (which I had a feeling was not doable) or find me another room when I am back. When back at 23:00 I found that my door had not been fixed and asking to receive another room I was asked to wait for over an hour to fix the door. By that time I was tired, irritated, and demanded to talk to a manager. The manager although in a room nearby would not come out and only 15 minutes later provided me another room. I moved to another room. Hurray! It was larger. Well it still did not have a closet or sink at the bathroom but I could get into bed without climbing over my suitcase. So I happily I took a shower and then going to the sink to brush teeth I opened taps. To my astonishment, the sink had no drainpipes!!! All the water came gushing on the floor on my suitcase and feet! Now I needed to dry my suitcase and hair as I had an early flight. When I tried to use the hairdryer, it did not work. But by that time, I already understood the concept. I knew it, The problem is not with hairdryer – the problem was with the electricity. I was so tried I figured I probably should solve this on my own. I went one out-put after the other until I found one that had electricity working and YES – hairdryer working. I guess if it was not so sad, it was very funny. By 2 AM, I was dead tired just wanted to go to sleep. Fell immediately asleep only to be awakened by someone trying to enter my room as they forgot to change the room with the other person who had the key!However, the best part – when I complained in the morning- I got my 32$ back- Hurray!STAY AWAY!!!",Tel Aviv,"Dalit B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv</strong>",10,1.0

The room was albeit small, but perfectly curated to ensure comfort and cleverly designed storage spots for luggage and bits and bobs.Great shower, and showering products included. I had the park facing room, it was gorgeous. Super comfortable bed and optional room service to clean everyday.

It was an amazing atmosphere, really inviting, great drinks, really cool and vibrant design. The restaurant was a little overpriced but reasonable. however, I wouldn't waste money on the breakfast buffet, quite dear and a little bit average on the food side to be honest, but good coffee and nice staff.

What's great about Arlo is that you get the perks of a pricier hotel--great ambience, service, high-end sheets and toiletries, a good lobby bar and rooftop--with a much more reasonable price tag. King rooms are definitely on the small side but like all true New Yorkers they make super efficient use of the space and end up feeling charming and cozy rather than cramped. Besides you don't come to New York to hang out in your room. And the location of the Arlo puts you walking distance to Tribeca, Soho, and the West Village. Prime location.

They arranged for transportation to LaGuardia upon check out (a very reasonable $55).Very comfortable bed, great shower. They could use a place to hang your bath towel when you shower but that's a small detail missed compared to all of the great aspects of the hotel (the roof top bar, the outstanding lobby area and the 24/7 snack bar.)Coffee in the morning is not complimentary but you do get free refills. There is amazing pizza nearby (Ben's Famous Sicilian). Make a left out of Arlo, make a right on Spring St and follow it about 2-3 blocks and it's on the left (I think at Thompson Street). For great breakfast, make a right out of Arlo and walk south on Hudson St to Tribeca for breakfast at Bubby's. I asked for ice at 11 PM and it was delivered to my room in less than 5 minutes.I wish I knew this before I stayed at Arlo; if you contact them prior to arrival they will have you picked up at the airport (LaGuardia or JFK) by a driver for a very reasonable rate.My room was very small but I was expecting that. Arlo provides bikes if you have the time to check one out (I wouldn't ride a bike in the city without a good fitting bike helmet, though).

While small, the room was efficient and had everything we needed for our short stay. The bed was really comfortable and the window had a great view. We were bushed so the city noise(horns, sirens) weren’t a bother but for light sleepers it may be an issue. The bathroom offers little privacy with a frosted glass wall separating it from the bed area. If you aren’t totally comfortable with the person you are with witnessing all your bathroom activities-then get 2 rooms. The common areas of the hotel were very cool including outdoor space and several seating areas as well as a nice rooftop bar. These areas were very busy with non guests - in fact the whole downstairs area didn’t feel like a hotel at all but more like a bustling bar area. There is a small store to buy candy, food and $7 bottles of water. I suggest going to the 24 hour bodega on the corner instead ! The service is friendly and the A and 1 train stops are nearby. It’s about a 5-10 min walk from the shops and restaurants of SoHo . I do think for the space that the price tag was hefty but all of NY is quite pricey.

This was the worst experience I've ever had from a hotel. We arrive at 3:00am due to a delayed flight, they give us our room and as soon as I walk in, it feels like the heater is ON. Mind you this is one of the hottest day in NY (August 8, 2018).So I go to the thermostat to turn it to cool and notice that it's already at Cool and set to 65 degrees even though the room temperature was closer to 80 degrees inside. I go down to the reception area and let them know the situation, explain I know how a thermostat works but maybe it's locked or they may know something I don't know? They quickly send a technician and after a few minutes they tell me the A/C unit has to be drained and it's broken.At this point I think to myself, no worries they'll just give me another room, I didn't unpack so it wasn't that big of a deal. Then just as I thought that to myself I get a notification on my phone. We had other people we had traveled with and they texted me this:""Did you know you guys got the last rooms? Lol I am waiting for them to find me accommodations elsewhere, my room was guaranteed and they overbooked. Dummies""So I knew this wasn't going to end well. So we go back to the front desk and the technician tells the supervisor that the A/C is broken and there's nothing they can do right now. The supervisor tells me that he's very sorry for the inconvenience but sadly there's no more rooms (I already knew that) and that he just sent our friends to another hotel and everyone is fully booked. He told me to just deal with it and he'll promise me, actually these were his exact words ""I'll promise you the world"" the following day to change me to a better room and also take care of me.I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, I know things happen and in reality I can't blame them for something that they have no control over. Also it was already 4:00am and I needed to be awake by 7:00 so that meant by the time I get to bed I would get less than 3 hours of sleep.I go back to my room which feels like a Sauna and take a quick shower just to get my body temperature cooler and go to sleep with as little clothes as possible. The whole night I kept scratching and feeling very uncomfortable, I was so tired that I tried to dismiss it but before even 7:00am hit I couldn't take it anymore and woke up to a bunch of bugs biting me! (SEE PICTURES)It was the most disgusting thing I have ever experienced, I took another shower literally 2 hours later and went downstairs and showed them the pictures I had taken. By then I had to speak to a different supervisor because the night supervisor had already left, she again apologized and said they would get me into a NEW room right away and if there's anything I needed from them to let them know, they comped us our breakfast that morning which wasn't really good.She then told me her Manager would be in soon and she would talk to him to see what they can do. Since I had to leave I told her that he can call me or we can chat later, I was there for business. I get back to the Hotel in the afternoon and by then I was doing some investigating to see what it was that bit me and I come to find out that it was BED BUGS! I read other reviews online that also said it was bed bugs, when I met with the manager I explained my situation and he didn't really seem to care never once said ""we're sorry"" or took blame.I told him I thought it was bed bugs, especially based on previous reviews and he clearly said they had the room expected and brought a K9 and it turned out negative. Sounded like a bunch of BS to me and the way he talked to me sounded like this happens often.I told him that I have to now throw away my clothes and luggage because from what I've read online this stuff can come back home with you and create a much bigger problem. He then offered me a free complimentary 3 day stay with them at a future date. I immediately laughed and told him, ""If a restaurant serves you a cold steak and you complain about it and you get a new plate and the steak is cold again. They apologize and say, they would comp you the next time you come back to the restaurant do you think you'd want to go again even if it's free?"" He really didn't seem to care what I had to say and basically said, ""that's all I can do for you, we don't offer any type of monterey compensation, the best I can do is maybe bump it to a 5 night stay, but that's about it"" I quickly laughed and went to my room grabbed some stuff and checked out as fast as I could!

The Arlo is a sad knock-off: There's no closet or dresser. The sink is in the room. The lighting is harsh. The bathroom is a tiny square. The numerous switches are complicated. (An engineer came up when I couldn't figure out how to turn on the bedside and couldn't figure them out--it took an MIT graduate later.) By the time you've hung your clothes on hangers by the bed and put a few sundries on the small counter around the sink, you're surrounded by a mess that will only get messier unless you're severely OCD. The downstairs lobby has expensive items for sale, ranging from scented candles to wellness-granola to in-your-face-so-cool-bad-for-you-candies in dime-store glass jars. Stay here if you don't plan to spend any time in your room and aren't offended by the commercialization of the green movement, designed to make people think they're saving the planet by spending money on rip-offs.

There we met Nathaniel who was tending the lounge bar. He was amazing and soooo kind; my nephew had a tummy ache so he made him a special "" tonic"" of bitters and a fresh lemonade. He also told my 9 year old nephew all about the hotel AND that there were rooms that have bunk beds with their own TV's! We had so much fun with Nathaniel that we let the front desk know what a gem he is. I then sent an email to the hotel to let them know too; when u meet kind people you have to let the world know! On line we met Lindsey. She was so nice too... so we decided to have a stay-cation night in the bunk bed room! Lindsey hooked that up and we stayed at the hotel recently. The ARLO/SOHO is a perfect place to stay; the rooms are super fun and the staff are all amazing! Lucky for us we actually met Lindsay when we checked in and Nathaniel was in the lounge that night! we had an amazing dinner in the lounge from HAROLD's and the next day we had brunch at HAROLD's. the food is fantastic! the staff in the restaurant are so kind and super nice; in fact Lilli made us the best hot chocolates we have ever had! Everything we ate on both occasions was excellent; we will definitely be back for the fried chicken!this hotel is a GEM! very affordable, great location and a great staff.

The Lobby is amazing with great work and lounging space. Somewhere I really want to hang out and feel comfortable working on my laptop in the morning with a latte in hand or just relaxing in the evening with an adult beverage. There is a full bar adjacent to the Lobby and close to reception, is a well-stocked snack bar for a light take away bite or latte. An oversized blackboard lists the Arlo events which include live music on the weekends and special events during the weeknights (count me in for movie night). The Lobby opens to a huge terrace with glamping tents for the perfect tete a tete. And what could be better than a rooftop bar with a view of The Hudson and a glass of rose? Yup, the Arlo has that too! Come morning, it’s the place for yoga classes. The restaurant is an added plus and a great place for a casual meet-up and meal. Special mention to Lindsay at the front desk who makes sure my stay is absolutely perfect, every single time. She has even texted me when she wasn't on duty to ensure all was well during my stay...talk about 5-star treatment! Lindsay does her best to make sure I have an upgraded room. And speaking of the rooms, the beds are super comfy, and the rooms are cozy chic. The hotel is perfectly situated, close to the amazing SoHo shops and the charming West Village.

We came for a family trip but I would have liked this place as a business hotel too. Rooms are super small. Kept bumping our knees into the wooden platform beds, the space was so tight. We got a room with a terrace and it made it a little less claustrophobic. Nevertheless it is efficient and clean. They make great use of the space, the safe was rolled under the bed. We didn’t come to nyc to hang out in a hotel room anyway so all good. They have a mini Dylan’s candy bar and the teens with us liked that. They also have a 24/7 market that sells a variety of fresh food, salads, snacks and drinks - Very comvenient. Lastly The rooftop bar has amazing views and it’s worth having a drink up there.

After having tried 5 of them I feel that I have finally found it!N.B. I'm not naming hotels since that's not the purpose of this review and I was not unhappy with them, just not fully satisfied given the high-price you pay.Price-Quality is impeccable! The location is perfect, whether you want to walk/run in the Hudson river, go to Soho (just around the corner) or take the metro somewhere else. The rooms are small but very comfy (the bed is really good in the King Size room) and it has everything you need. While the rooms might be a bit too small for a couple to spend the day, in the end you are likely not going to do that.The open spaces on the ground-floor are really nice and you can easily unwind from a long day or keep working in the library with a glass of wine. The coffee and small market place open 24/7 with tones of sweets available - very nice for a late snack.The service was amazing all-in-all, both at the reception, at the bar (thank you for all the wine recommendations!), restaurant and cleaning service. I used the laundry service and was very happy with the speed and quality overall.I also appreciated the attention to details (not seen everywhere):- the small chocolate they leave in the pillow in the afternoon/evening service or how the room is tided up without actually having anything drastically moved.- Chromecast in every room to make it easy for you to watch whatever you want (Thank you!).- The various events proposed.

We especially enjoyed going to the Arlo rooftop during nighttime as there was always great music and a big crowd of people coming from within the hotel or outside to watch the sundown or have a drink. We even met some native New Yorkers who were very polite and interested in getting to know us. The interior of the hotel was perfectly designed and the limited space very cleverly used. Our hotel room was tiny yet offered everything we needed, plus a kingsized bed with a view directly to Downtown Manhattan’s beautiful buildings. Due to the very particular choice of furniture, lighting and style, the overall atmosphere in the hotel was unbelievably cosy and chic and almost felt home-like.The lobby was like a big living room where all hotel guests would come together and either work, talk, relax, have a something to eat or make plans for the next day.

It's always been a fun, relaxing treat for a nice getaway. One of the features of Arlo that stands out is the friendly service! An employee named Abby checked me in and out of the hotel for my stay, and she helped me feel welcome and taken care of. I had a stressful trip leading up to my stay at Arlo, and I arrived too early for check in. I was nervous and frustrated to think I might have to wait a few more stressful hours before I could check in -- I can't tell you how grateful I was for the welcoming smile and helpful service that greeted me at Arlo! Abby reassured me that she could get me checked into my room right away. Later, she gave me perfect recommendations based on specific requests I had.

The woman at the front desk took our order but made up the prices for the items, different from what they were listed. When I asked why there was a difference in price she lied again and said, ""Ma'am, this is New York, don't you know there is extra tax"". I grew up near New York so I am very familiar as a matter of fact that, that is a lie. I then explained the price she charged me was much over what the tax would have been so perhaps she scanned something incorrectly. She rolled her eyes and shooed me away saying she had other things to attend to. Never have I had service like this. Totally rude and uncalled for when all I had was a valid question.

I also really liked that each night the hotel had something different. If you're on Instagram, the hotel puts up updates for the weekly activities.Yes the rooms were small, but wow they were designed really well. I knew from reading reviews prior to booking that people were complaining about the small rooms...but its New York people! I do have to mention though that there not much privacy in regards to the bathroom - so hopefully you're staying with someone you know.. really well!Also loved the location of the hotel. We ended up getting Ubers most of the time because it happened to be too cold for our liking (we're from Sydney so it was colder than our winter), though we did walk to Greenwich village one day and to the heart of Soho as well. You really just had to walk across that one main road near the hotel and you were in the heart of SoHo with all the shops, though note that theres not much else on that same vicinity as the hotel you need to walk a couple of blocks. The hotel did have a little coffee shop (and lollies) in the lobby so that gets you going till breakfast.Next time I travel to New York I will definitely be staying here again (next time hopefully in summer).:)",australia,"demii5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>australia</strong>",2,5.0

In fact it was a really chilled environment meaning it was comfortable enough to sit and enjoy a glass of wine downstairs when returning from a busy day.The hotel was exactly fit for purpose for us whilst staying in New York. The rooms were compact but functional. They had everything you need and there was a little shop downstairs where you could buy room essentials like water etc. The only thing I'd say is that if this is your first time visiting NYC, although the hotel is lovely, you may want to consider the location as the subway is a few blocks away, there isn't a great deal on the block or two around the hotel therefore I'd maybes check what your purpose of trip is.

The King room gave us all the space we needed for our Manhattan stay, the rooms aren't superspacy but that's simply New York for you. The rooms are laid out very smart however, so we never felt claustrofobic. The modern design and ultrasoft beds helped out a lot on that part too. The staff of Arlo is what makes this hotel tick: enthousiastic staff, energetic folks with great tricks for conquering this mad city and a very positive attitude towards helping us feel at home in the big city. The location is perfect, with so many shops, sights and restaurants located in quite possibly one of the most ""quiet"" areas in Manhattan. There's a lot of hotels out there offering much less value for much more money, so there's no doubt we will be back!

Our HVAC never worked, even though every day we called the engineers. They came up right away but they never fixed anything. Then again, we were never sure if the front desk staff ever told them when we were out of the room. Being that we stayed during a very hot time, not having proper A/C was the worst part.

Also the fact that we had bunk beds meant that there was a bit more floor space than the average NYC hotel. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the fact that the bathroom is basically in the bedroom, it is just partitioned off with frosted glass.

On checking I was greeted with very helpful staff, the process was fast and my room was ready. The room was small, in fact very small with a sink in the room and a shower and toilet separated only by a frosted glass divider. If you like your privacy you won't find much here. I was staying by myself so that was fine.We then headed off down to the bar (the rooftop one didn't open until 4pm) and thats where the contradiction begins. The staff were consistently (different staff on different days) incapable of providing anything remotely describable as service. From bar staff being unaware of what they stocked to actually shouting at us they were too busy to serve. The rooftop staff obviously are trained together with the other staff and they were equally as incompetent.Breakfast was a buffet with a limited choice but was enough and they have a decent enough selection for gluten free requirements. Again the staff let the place down.The rooftop bar was also closed one evening for a function which we thought was inappropriate considering its advertised as a feature of the hotel.","Moraira, Spain","822richardp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moraira, Spain</strong>",15,3.0

The only downside is the size of the room, although they have done a really intelligent design - staying with a friend meant we were quite 'enclosed' - that said - you can go downstairs or upstairs and enjoy some fun things. The best thing was the gal behind the bar - best barwoman we have ever expereinced - so awesome at her job. Check-in people are very nice - but a bit high school musical / varsity club at times.

The staff is one of the things that made the stay so comfortable. NYC can be intimidating but the staff reached out to us to check us in smoothly. I loved the lobby and the cozy sitting places, it felt like home and it was nice to see people sitting in the chairs and reading books. The rooms are small but comfortable especially the mattresses. I slept well and loved waking up to a wonderful view of the city when I rolled over. The bar staff at Harold's was also super welcoming and we had a great chat with Jose (I think was his name) about the tequila we were drinking. We asked a lot of questions and he was happy to answer them. The rooftop bar was fun with a vibrant crowd and an amazing view. The little shop in the lobby was perfect for my sweet tooth in the evening and my healthy eating habits in the morning. I am sorry I missed yoga on the rooftop. All I can say is this hotel was just so cute - from the cozy lobby, the tents in the courtyard, to the activities- yoga and mediation. It was a pleasant surprise to feel so comfortable in the city.

The fan he gave me was quite useless but at this point it was around 1:45am and I had taken a long flight from the west coast and was ready to hit the sack.

We didn’t eat in the restaurant but enjoyed a few drinks in both the courtyard and rooftop bar with excellent service. Overall great value for money- only small complaint in our room (Queen size) was a lack of wardrobe hanging space- the “pole in the wall” style design had around 6 hangers only- another one on the opposite wall would’ve done the job!.. an easy to use hand held steamer came in handy though which is a nice touch in the rooms.

And the Arlo happens to be the best I have found so far. Located at the heart of Soho, it offers some of the most modern work areas (both inside and outside) I have seen. It is worth visiting their Website to see pictures of the working areas as they are pretty impressive. No need to to worry about finding an electrical outlet for your laptop, they are absolutely everywhere, even at the hotel bar. The Arlo is also a great place for business meeting of for travelling with work colleagues. I also noticed many couples visiting for a long romantic weekend. It is also conveniently located for some serious shopping and dining. I recommend making a budget before departure, otherwise Soho could run your credit card pretty high.The rooms are a bit small, but extremely clean and practical. You can take long showers without the risk of running out of hot water. They also make a killer latte at the reception. The hotel restaurant is also great. I tried half of the menu and was really impressed (you have to try the pizza). The strongest point however, is the staff. They are super friendly, especially Caroline and Lindsey at the lobby who will go out of their way to make your stay the best possible experience. The bartenders are also terrific and I was particularly surprised at the cleaning staff’s friendliness (in other hotels I have been to, they tend to be discreet and invisible). My only drawback would be the price of the food they sell at the reception, which is mighty expensive.

The hotel is very clean and chic but our 4th floor room was very small. The sink is right in the main part of the room and the desk is a small fold-down desk. The bed was very comfortable but up against a window and the inside person has to climb over the bed. It's nice to look out the window, but not good if you have to get up in the middle of the night.

Hidden Gem: the second floor has a beautiful area you can host meetings, or get some work done yourself and still have a peek over the balcony at the scene going on down stairs. The rooftop is beautif. Many hotels try to overdue the asthetics but this location plays perfectly off the areas natural beauty and gives amazing views. Food, drinks, Dylan’s Candy Bar ( if you haven’t had you are missing out ) and also themed nights make this and ideal space for business and pleasure.",,Dale M,0,5.0

During our flight, they had tried to take payment from an expired credit card (my fault I know), however they had immediately cancelled the reservation and then sold all rooms, leaving us no chance to try and rectify the situation. After time spent on the phone they confirmed they no longer had any rooms and we were left to try and find a new hotel for our stay in New York at the last minute. Prices had sky rocketed, loads had sold out and nothing in our chosen location.

She was spot on. I'm not sure what people expect, but considering we spent time sleeping and showering in the place, we had ample room - but then again, we aren't American, so expectations are different. Clean, tidy, fresh and well appointed - we loved the steamer instead of an iron, and having the hairdryer meant more room for my partners clothes in her suitcase! Only minor detail was not having any tea and coffee facilities - instead you're forced to pay for overpriced coffee down in the lobby... my advice: have one of their 'draft latte's' and then go explore other watering holes (not Starbucks, for your own sanity!)- its NY, you trip over great coffee shops!The bathroom has a great rain-head shower, fantastic body wash/shampoo products that are yours to use (and incidentally, almost everything can be purchased to take home if you're so inclined). The bed was very comfy, although pounding round NYC meant we barely remember falling asleep, we woke refreshed and raring to go the following day.Staff were always friendly, the pick 'n' mix candy store was a definite win and the communal areas were warm and inviting.I'd recommend staying here for those who want a great location (#1 Subway @ Canal St) thats close to everything you need in Manhattan. You get free WiFi and if you do want to watch some TV, they are huge... just remember that 'on-demand' content is extra. Final point - there are two sets of blinds, one to diffuse the light, other to create a blackout - the picture windows are amazing and are a great size, but NYC at the 9th floor isn't renowned for its views! Just remember, it's pretty trendy and not a 'full service' hotel by any stretch, but it well worth the money and we are going back for sure for NYC Part 2!","Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","matthewbmk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milton Keynes, United Kingdom</strong>",18,5.0

Lots of public lounge space - and a bit of a club vibe at night, but not nearly as disco or loud as the Ace Hotel lobby. The room itself is extremely cozy but efficient. I actually enjoyed the queen bed built into the end of the room against the window, and the bed linens were very nice. The room's width was the length of the bed frame, which made it kind of a fun space, but perhaps less comfortable if traveling as a pair - crawling over your partner to get out of bed. It was also nice that the windows could open, as an option to noisy A/C. Plenty of electrical outlets, and a nice bonus of electric window shades.The less pragmatic parts of the room: the shower was (literally) open to the toilet area. No curtain or barrier. The water pressure is good, but that meant that there was a lot of water outside of the shower ledge on the floor when I got out. Weird. Storage is definitely limited, but it worked fine for me. In terms of the rest of the hotel, the public spaces are great - pockets of quiet lounge areas if you need to work or make a call, outdoor courtyard which is rare, and the attached restaurant Harold's is decent with nice service. The little Dylan's candy bar and coffee service in the lobby is a nice touch - but that line is not surprisingly long in the morning with one person both ringing up and serving as barista.Some less good things: Elevators are slow - not sure why, but that was a consistent problem waiting for the elevators. Also, the rooftop wasn't open despite the beautiful weather.

An excellent opportunity to explore the main lobby, the inner square, the reading rooms and off course the bar itself! Cocktails were great btw.We originally stayed in a bunk room, because they had city view. Tough the rooms are nice and the view is nice, this leads me to the main disadvantage of the hotel. The hotel is located in Soho, near two metro lines, but also directly next to the Holland tunnel. This tunnel is a real nuthouse and until very late in the evening (night) drivers there are sounding there horns to get into the tunnel. Unfortunately the rooms aren't isolated enough to keep the noise out.I must say however that upon our request, we got an upgrade to a room wich was located on the backside. This was much appreciated and an improvement for sure.All in all this has not influenced our positive feeling about this hotel, because the vibe is so loveable.

But everything was clean and tidy and I liked it alot. There is a deli/liquor store on the corner run by a Mr. Sonny from Korea and I totally got along with him, so I definitely became friends with the 24hr deli around the corner for those late NYC munchie nights.

The resident Harold’s restaurant soon became a favorite with its array of relaxed and no-fuss yet delicate dining with a great flair for flavor and a friendly service.

Quiet, immaculate, great lighting, everything you need (including umbrella in every room) and nothing you don't need. Location was perfect because you are literally at the edge of SOHO, just outside the pedestrian noise. Walkability to all the subway stations is excellent and if you need something like a fresh banana in the morning, there's a bodega at the corner of Spring & Hudson.

The room size didn't bother us too much.. but I didn't really expect the bathroom to be literally in the room.. we actually visited bathrooms elsewhere in the hotel when we needed to go.. No matter how close you are to someone you want privacy in that aspect. The worst thing was that every day we wanted to give the bar a try and sit downstairs to enjoy a nightcap. By no means would I have ever enjoyed sitting with a bunch of people on WebEx calls with Apple MacBooks in front of them.. and I am talking like 40 people all with a laptop taking up all the room and I am pretty sure with no drinks or food from the bar. Also the bar shut at 11pm.. maybe I am just too British but I'm not gonna want a Bailey's at 10pm.and why would I go up to the rooftop bar when it would literally just be my boyfriend, me and a bartender.The first time I saw an AW18 preview at the top of the stairs I thought it was cool but by the third day of pretentious marketing and PR bods loitering at the top of the stairs I quite frankly never wanted to see a shift dress or fur collared coat again.I can't deny the room had everything we needed, just on a tiny scale. Check in was fast and check out even faster. Rooms should have been cleaned before 5pm...but again maybe I expect too much?The hotel was clean and staff were pleasant for the most part. The design is cool and hip but not attractive for someone after a nice holiday.

I knew the rooms were small based on the reviews. It is a good thing I was alone because I don't see how 2 people would be comfortable. They would need to climb over each other to get into the bed since it is against the window. With that being said, the bed was extremely comfortable and cozy. One night I was hanging out in the cool tents outside with my 25 year old nieces. It was a weeknight and only one other tent was occupied. After 20 minutes a waiter finally came over and told us if we didn't order a drink we would have to leave the tent. I was actually thinking about ordering a drink then decided not to based on his attitude. After my flight home was canceled for an impending snowstorm, I asked the front desk if I could extend my stay. I was brushed off by the employee who told me they were sold out. She asked for my phone number after a second employee overheard and suggested they could call me if they had any cancellations. They never called and I ended up checking out and finding a hotel in Chelsea. At the new hotel I was greeted immediately. Everyone was friendly. My new room was 3 times the size of Arlo and had a proper desk, Nespresso maker and a real bathroom. The hotel also had a complimentary happy hour with wine and a gym.

I booked dinner at a nice restaurant, broadway show tickets and a stay overnight. If your thinking about not staying overnight, it can be done but one thing to keep in mind. Getting into NYC might be an issue. Why take a chance, I'd rather stay in a nice hotel and relax so we don't have any bumps in our plans. My hotel searching lead me to the Arlo hotel chain. Now SOHO is out of the way to see a Broadway show but guess what? The E train is close by, all of NYC is all just a train stop away. I saw the Arlo website, the hotel chain looks fun! The fun starts with a Dylan's Candy Bar on premise as well as a rooftop bar, a fun bar downstairs, a cool area for sitting called ""The Library"" and totally fab restaurant. If I'm planning a weekend of fun, I want my hotel to keep up with me.Checking in was a breeze. Walk up to the large monitors, type you name and out pop out your room keys. (My keys didn't work the first time I went to my room) Quick and easy.Once upstairs, we walk to our room. Here's where you really need to check their website and see exactly what your choosing for your room. They offer a room with bunk beds? Yeah.. Not fun. We chose a nice Queen size bed with a courtyard view. Some of the higher priced rooms have terraces. I'm thinking back to when I had a young family with kids or even teenagers. Unless your getting multiple rooms, this is not your typical family hotel.Our room? Had uber chic conveniences, Blind Barber Shower products?? I've been going to Blind Barber for years, love them! My issue with the room, its fashioned after a cruise ship cabin. If I had to stay here a few days, I might be cranky. There are no drawers to put socks and underwear. The bed is pushed very close to the window (Which is my side of the bed) If I have to go to the bathroom? I'm rolling over my wife which is kinda funky. Overall, it wasn't too bad. The hotel chain is trying to keep the fun and chic theme throughout your stay. They want you in the room less and around the hotel mingling. And man do I love to mingle! The roof deck bar, we went but it was too cold. If you want to explore NYC, SOHO is a great area with lots to do. This is my first Arlo hotel and from what I've experienced, I can't wait to try their other hotels.","New York City, New York","BillySalts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",103,5.0

Each time we came in and out of the lobby, we were welcomed and asked if there was anything they could do to help us, which goes a long way. The design of the hotel is off the charts - each space is curated and thoughtfully arranged. I was also pleasantly surprised that we were upgraded to a corner room with a large accessible bathroom - very nice touch. There was some misunderstanding with my reservation (I thought I had booked a package that included welcome cocktails but never received them) however the front desk staff was quick to provide them for me anyways, which shows they have been well trained in customer service.

To start off with the good: service at reception is great, all staff is very kind, hotel is modern, clean, and up-to-date, and the interior is a nice mix of sort of minimalist Scandinavian design but also welcoming and not too cold or sterile. On the negative side unfortunately the atmosphere and social environment is a disaster for a hotel. I do not know if it was just while we were there, but for the duration of our stay (6 nights) all of the common areas of the hotel were filled with young and exceedingly ""trendy"" young professionals, all sitting with their Apple computers during all hours of the day and evening. It was quite inhospitable and made using any of the common areas impossible, even something so simple as sitting and waiting for an Uber to arrive. The loud music and ""cool"" factor going on every day in a rented space in the middle of the lounge are behind the reception was incredibly obnoxious and the atmosphere made anyone who wasn't working in marketing or a PR firm want to run away as quickly as possible. At one point some of the people sitting with their computers even started doing yoga, and while I have absolutely nothing against yoga, a hotel lobby is not the location for such an activity. On top of that the people on their computers were so spread out that they even took up the bar area and while they sat at the bar without any drinks they took up so much space it made it uncomfortable to have a drink there. Another negative was the servicing of the rooms which was atrociously slow. As tourists in the city we were gone from our rooms from around 10am until usually 5pm and only on one occasion was our room cleaned before we came back. That is simply not acceptable. Yes, the rooms are small, but that is exactly what is advertised, and while we were there for too long (a long weekend or other short trip with not much luggage is better) it was still comfortable enough and it was what we were prepared for.","Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo","faintasticduo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo</strong>",59,3.0

I have since returned in July 2017, and most recently last month - as the Arlo SoHo has become one of my go-to hotels whenever visiting NYC for work. It's beautifully designed (and is instagram worthy, and therefore is quietly becoming a landmark on its own), but it is the above-and-beyond mentality of the team that really sets the Arlo SoHo apart. I can't express how generous the team is with regard to their high level of genuine enthusiasm, and speed at accommodating requests, and offering guests perks and benefits to maximise their stay.The service before check-in is impeccable - everything was pre-arranged down to the last, precise detail. I arrived from a red-eye flight, and my check-in process (from lobby to room) was completed in under 5 minutes! The hotel is centrally located - a 2-minute walk to the subway station, and a leisurely walk to SoHo, Tribeca, and even Downtown. Amazing views throughout. Awesome toiletries, and plush bedding.I've already reviewed the room and the high level of service (which keeps getting better), but I really appreciate that everyone on the team remembered me by name and took note of my preferences and made arrangements accordingly - I felt like a VIP at a 6-star hotel - ultimately, staying at the Arlo SoHo rounds off any New York trip.","Makati, Philippines","Travelling_Brogue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Makati, Philippines</strong>",61,5.0

The ""sidetable"" is just the windowpane and in the winter, that is very cold.The finishes of the bathroom are also not top quality.

The room was great for the most part but ours had a glass partition wall between the bed and the toilet, which isn't for everyone, we weren't a big fan, but hey you might not be that bothered.

The rooms are quite compact for a couple sharing, but all the facilities inside are great. The bed was really comfy and has loads of room for two people. You can hear traffic faintly at night, but it’s New York for heaven’s sake. We are both light sleepers and always felt well rested. Great shower in the room, rainfall shower head and pressure/temperature were consistently high. Charging points, space for cases, safe, hairdryer, iron – all the things you need are there. Perhaps with the exception of a bottle opener!The service provided by all of the staff was excellent, everyone was very friendly and courteous. We received a complementary upgrade from a queen to a king room with a city view on our arrival, which was a welcome bonus. Typical example of quality of service was that when we asked for our room to be cleaned one afternoon, due to us feeling a little unwell. Cleaning staff were down promptly and left the place looking spotless.Location wise, we found it easy to get to Arlo Soho from JFK. There are plenty of subway lines within walking distance. You can be the West Village within 30 minutes by foot and we found quite a few good places to have breakfast in the mornings.Planning to visit NYC again in the near future and would definitely stay at Arlo Soho while in the city.","Cambridge, United Kingdom","FreeToBe_123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

Bed was super comfy and the hotel was quiet at night.Location was great. To the south of Soho and just north of Tribeca. Perfect for quick exploring if you're tight for time. Still, not too far from Meatpacking or down to WTC or the river.The check-in process was swift, but a little too swift. No information on room or facilities or the fact I had been upgraded!Room was well done, lots squeezed in and good for a one-night stay. Would be a bit tight if there had been two of us or the stay was longer. Toiletries on the shower wall wasn't in keeping with the hi-end style of the place.People who are a bit prudish or staying with a friend may not like the glass shower walls.

From the pick n mix and great coffee in reception (big pluses) to the live jazz playing that night in the bar and the seemless and easy to use self-serve check in. Staff were friendly and youthful and unstuffy. The building was awesome and quirky and loved the different levels, roof bar, outside tents and the welcoming and relaxed feeling. The other guests were unpretentious and hip. The room was super. Looked better than the photos and was compact but so well thought out, with heaps of USB and power sockets in convenient places, top quality toiletries and the most comfy bed I’ve ever slept in. I legitimately said to my friend staying at Soho House I prefer the Arlo - it is like a younger and better version of a “house hotel”! They get the simple and important things right at a great price.

It's difficult to find a hotel in New York that checks all the boxes that this one does. It's comfortable, well designed, friendly, affordable, in a pretty good location and has 24 hour hipster ""bodega"" in the lobby. Its probably the easiest check in and check out I've ever had. The rooms are not huge - par for the course in New York - but you didn't come to New York to hang out in a hotel room. The interiors are nice and clean and don't have that tacky corporate feel that some hotels do. If you are there for an intimate getaway the lack of separate and private bathroom may be a challenge - the bathroom is essentially a sectioned of portion of the main room - but for business trips - this place is perfect. It's in a good location near the Spring St and Canal St Subway, a 10 minute walk to the center of soho - 25 minute walk to the West Village. I'll be back.",,Sam S,8,5.0

I had stayed at other hotels in the area and have been turned off by high prices and loud construction. Because it was January, this was an amazing deal. It was also a quiet stay.I like how cozy and convenient the room is, especially for just one person. It is very clean and comfortable, and no space is wasted. The lobby is hipster cool, and a place I would like to hang out. There's live music and turntables and yurts and lots of cool Bowie stuff in the gift shop. The only strange thing is a pervasive perfumey smell in the common areas. I tend to be allergic but I got used to it and it didn't overcome me, although one night the smell did wake me up.Service is a little detached and non-traditional, but I'm old so I guess I have to just get used to checking in on a screen.The restaurant, Harold's Meat and Three, is very good, albeit kind of pricey. I'm looking forward to going there again on a future trip.Loved the coffee bar at the front of the lobby, until I got ""New Yorked"" by it: $15 for a small hot chocolate and a cup of fresh fruit. You can get the same delicious La Columbe coffee just a couple blocks away at the actual La Columbe store on Spring Street, and cheaper fruit at Pret a Manger.

I stayed at the Arlo Soho from January 18-21 with my boyfriend and we loved it. The hotel is very trendy, definitely a lot of young, stylish people staying here. The lobby is very cute with a little general store and candy bar, and there is a hotel bar and well appointed communal areas. The bodega, as others have mentioned, is very expensive. I get that this is NYC and of course hotels charge a premium, but I paid $5.45 for a tea. A tea should not cost $5.45, it's basically just hot water. That's my own fault though (laziness), as there are enough of places nearby to grab a coffee or tea. Also, the drinks at the bar are crazy expensive but beer is a reasonable price. The bar is cool and the outdoor tents they have set up for the winter are not to be missed, so I'd opt for a beer or two to check it out. The room was awesome! Yes, teeny tiny, but for two people for a couple days it's no problem. I could see if you were staying a week or so, wanting more space to unpack, but we had no issues. The bathroom could be problematic if you're not comfortable with your travel partner. The sliding glass door didn't stay shut, it would slide open while in there! Shower pressure was awesome, and bathroom products were nice. We both really loved the shower!The bed was comfortable, the room came with a steamer, blow dryer, mini-fridge. Biggest complaint is that there is no coffee or tea provided in the room (see above comment about bodega). I really feel that a hotel room should have coffee/tea! I know that there isn't a lot of space in the rooms and they are obviously trying to maximize the space but if you aren't going to have tea and coffee in the rooms, it should be a little cheaper in the lobby. One morning we asked for a breakfast recommendation and were directed to Bubby's. Personally, it wasn't for us. Breakfast food was way overpriced (I know this is NYC and I am happy to pay the price for NYC restaurants, but this place was a bit too much for food quality that was just OK). We would recommend The Grey Dog on Mulberry Street, decent prices, big plates, good food! Overall, we had a wonderful stay and aside from the minor things mentioned here no complaints!","Toronto, Canada","melissarose88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",54,5.0

Have to say that this hotel is fantastic. The staff are all very friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.

We had a queen room overlooking the entrance to Holland Tunnel, the room was perfect, everything you need is provided (hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel) so you can travel light. We read a lot of reviews before we left saying that the rooms were small, the bathroom facilities were too impersonal. Well the rooms are advertised as 'micro' rooms so what do people expect? We didn't find the rooms too small at all, they're really well designed, and the for the time you spend in the room they're ideal. The cases stow away under the bed and the free safe is an added bonus too. Free Wi-Fi, facilities to print boarding passes for the return journey. All round excellent stay. We were a little confused about the coffee in the lobby, sometimes it was complementary and sometimes we had to pay for it. It was my 50th Birthday while we were there and on our return to our room there was a gift from the staff, that was so thoughtful.

The lobby and lifts also smell amazing! The trendy SoHo location is perfect, a 3 min walk to the subway which takes no time at all to NYC hot spots and tourist attractions. Nearby there are so many local amazing restaurants to try, not a tourist trap in sight and we didn’t have a bad meal (go to Bubby’s for breakfast and China blue for dinner). We had breakfast at the hotel on the first morning which was really nice too- excellent scrambled eggs and bacon! There is a 24hr shop in the lobby with drinks and snacks but it is expensive. The room is small but it was actually perfect. Room under the bed to store your luggage everything had its right place and home so nothing got lost. HUGE window to let loads of night in, with black out blinds for bed time. It was immaculately cleaned every day and considering the shower is basically in the room, not a hint or smell of damp in sight. Only down side is that the shower and toilet is basically a frosted glass box - so if you are not comfortable with the person you are staying with or a bit of a prude it may not be for you. There also isn’t a kettle but they serve hot drinks 24/7 in the lobby. The bed was comfy and all the soap and products in the room smelt insanely good!

Street parking is not too difficult but strict no parking between 8am to 6pm if I rmb correctly so you are likely to use the 55 per day Valet serviceThey set up like a kiosk for self check in and out, on one side I enjoy the convienace, but on the other hand I find the lack of human interactions a minus to the overall experience. I was supposedly to get a breakfast with my booking which the machine didn't recognize or follow up, neither to any events or programs being offered by the hotel (like yoga... music). After all, I feel like I am no more than a pedestrian in front of the subway ticketing machine... is that really the modern day hospitality?Living wise it's ok.

Being a very tall couple, we were a little worried but remained positive. We originally booked for a Queen Room with a City View, but upon early check in were able to switch to a King Room with a Courtyard view which was amazing! Though the room was quite small, we both fit just fine, and were only really there for sleeping. I wish we got to stay longer because the lobby was STUNNING. The coziest looking huts outside, and there was tonnes of space to lounge around with friends, including a room that was playing a movie on our last night. The staff was extremely sweet and helpful and always had a smile. Such a long review but was genuinely very pleased with out stay!

Everything is very cleverly and compactly organised with power ports aplenty to keep all our electricals charged. The fridge , hairdryer and hand held steamer were all great and useful additions. The bed was so comfortable ! We loved the big waterfall shower and the complimentary toiletries which smelt divine. I was sad to realise that they were developed specially for arlo hotels so couldn’t be purchased. The things in need of improvement: the room needs very basic hot drink making facilities ! You get this in even bog standard 3 star hotels in the uk ! Going downstairs to get expensive hot drinks when all you want to do is have a few more minutes in bed was a tad annoying when you are on holiday ! But hardly an issue, just worth mentioning. But what was a bit of pain was, the drinks in all the bars are extortionately expensive! You have such a lovely funky and modern hotel with beautiful shared facilities, this is the only thing that lets it down.

The lobby and amenity spaces have an amazing ambience and there is always some form of programming going on (live music, movie nights etc.). The lobby ‘bodega’ is a great idea and a good spot to grab something on the go 24/7. Morning fitness classes are a great offering – we did the Pilates and it was quality.Yes, the rooms are small – I believe the hotel calls them “micro rooms” – but that’s kind of the point. The vibe of the hotel is about getting you out of your room to enjoy the amenities in the hotel and the surrounding city. If that vibe appeals to you then you will love this hotel. They’ve also done a good job of making the beds cozy to help make the small room almost feel like a plus.We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant most mornings and that was great. Good selection of ‘trendier’ breakfast items and good coffee.The location is great – walking distance to multiple subway lines and great bars, restaurants, shopping – you name it.

I arrived at the Arlo Soho and explained the situation to Lindsey G., a lobby host at Arlo Soho, who could see that I was stressed and flustered about it. She called the sister property and confirmed my reservation there was cancelled for me, then booked me at Arlo Soho, and gave me a better rate for the second night than I found online or that was offered me on the other hotel loyalty site, along with a couple free breakfast buffet coupons. This kind of service and good business practice is what will make me a loyal, regular guest at Arlo Soho for my once per month NYC weekend visits. The hotel was clean, well appointed, and efficient. The purpose of my visits to NYC is to go out and be in the city and socialize with friends, so the smaller room size is not a problem for me. I see some reviews complaining about the size of the hotel rooms at Arlo -- It's important to note that when a hotel says it has a a Scandinavian design aesthetic, that means small, clever, efficient spaces. I have stayed in hotels in Scandinavia and they are some of the tiniest spaces I've ever been in -- my room at Arlo was HUGE compared to those.

Everyone on the staff of the hotel was great, especially Lindsey G. She was the friendly face that greeted us when we walked in the door. She told us ""I'll be here every day you're here, so just let me know if you need anything."" She followed through on that by always giving us great advice on things to see and do. One example is steering us towards Rockefeller Center when we were looking for a skyscraper view of the Manhattan skyline. The location of the hotel is excellent. There are great restaurants (try The Greek), bars (try the Pegu Club!), and shops within walking distance. There are two subway stations within a 5 minute walk which give you many options for train lines to get where you need to go.The micro-suite layout of the room worked fine for us. It requires you to stay organized because you don't have room spread junk all over the place. The bed and comforter were excellent. Also, with the bed next to the window, you can lay in bed and get a great view of the surrounding buildings. The window opens so you can get fresh air. The common areas on the ground floor are very welcoming.Enjoy your stay and say hi to Lindsey for us!","San Francisco, California","paulgB1383EK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",0,5.0

The bed was comfy and there was a place for everything. If you plan on staying longer than a few days I would definitely get a larger room. One night in the queen room was fine, any longer I would need more space. The room came with large bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Bar soap for the sink and one tube of body lotion. A shower cap would have been helpful, but there was none. There is a fridge if you want to store you own bottles of water or snacks. Harold restaurant and bar are in the same space as The Arlo. We had breakfast there. Service and food were good. We stopped by the roof top bar for a cocktail. Drinks were good. Weird thing about the hotel and restaurant is no cash. Credit card and charge to your room only. I was not thrilled about this since I had cash to spend and did not want to charge everything. Is this a new thing?

I stayed here for 3 nights from October 20th- October 23rd. I live in the West Village, so this hotel is located very conveniently to my apartment and could be the perfect hotel to stay at any time my parents visit. Unfortunately, I’d have to think twice before staying here again.Front Desk: Whoever the male working the front desk Thursday night on October 19th was extremely accommodating and helped me make a last minute reservation for my Mom and I. Whoever the male working Friday morning October 20th around 8:30am (I believe his name is Dan) doesn’t belong in the service industry. I travel frequently and understand how early check-ins work. Nobody can guarantee early check-ins because it is reliant on who checks out at what time and if housekeeping can get there. Anyway, I called the front desk early Friday morning to explain to them that my Mom is an anxious traveler and would be arriving at the hotel by herself to check-in around 10:30am. I understood there would be no way to guarantee an early check-in, but if the possibility presented itself to prioritize my Mom’s check-in. In an obnoxious tone (Dan) replied, “To be blunt, no.” A more appropriate response would have been, “We cannot guarantee early check-ins, but we will make a note and do the best we can.” It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. If management is reading this, he is definitely not somebody you want being the “face” or first impression of the hotel. Lastly, the woman who checked us out on Monday morning October 23rd at 8:30am was lovely, sweet, and quick to process our check-out.Amenities: Wonderful! Loved the rooftop and lobby. Had drinks at the downstairs bar Saturday night. Lobby smells amazing and a very fun place to hang out (outside of your room).Rooms: BORDERLINE UNLIVABLE!!! No closet or drawer space to unpack. I understand the unique characteristics of a boutique hotel, but to offer no closet space or drawer is completely unsatisfactory. The A/C is also whack and SO LOUD! If you set it to 70 degrees you would be freezing and at 71 degrees dripping sweat. It would also keep both my Mom and I up all night because when the A/C clicks on it sounds like someone is trying to open the door to your room. Lastly the shower area was poorly designed in that the partial fixed glass door was not wide enough, which allowed water to flood the toilet area every time.I would love if a manager could be in touch with me regarding my feedback.","New York City, New York","Stephanie F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",25,3.0

The only logistical problem is that the hotel is situated at the entrance of the Holland Tunnel into New Jersey. A very busy point especially during the rush hours. Taking a cab from JFK to the hotel at Friday afternoon ( set price of USD 52,80) took us 2 hrs. Not only because the expressway was very full but also because downtown Manhatten was very full. The hotel is not situated right in the center of SoHo, so you need to to make short walk to the restaurants. We had a nice, clean twin-bedded room with enough space to move around. The beds were good and the room was very quiet. It is very nice to sit on the rooftop bar (if the weather permits), although it is rather expensive . We only found the reception a bit messy. Check-in was at a small table in a limited space just behind the front entrance. As the elevators ware situated on the right hand side, all guest also had to pass through this small sort of a corridor. This caused the messy impression.People at the reception were very friendly and helpful. They arranged for transport back to JFK by an Uber car.

SO, nothing about this room was small, the bathroom was completely private and separate from the rest of the room and the terrace wrapped around the room. Not sure how this happened - but we were thrilled. When we arrived at midnight, staff were super friendly, we grabbed a bite from the 24 hour bodega and went to sleep (after oohing and aahing at the view of World Trade and the Hudson). We found the room to be large, clean and comfortable. Bath products are luxurious. Friday night we stopped in for the complementary wine tasting (my son had water) and the staff person was super sweet and kindly explained everything about the wines.On our last day, we were held up at an event and I called front desk staff. She graciously allowed us a later check out, no questions asked. Loved her! Wish I could remember her name. Pluses - best location EVER. We could walk to great restaurants (Black Tap for my son, Bubby's for brunch, La Colombe for morning coffee), museums, shopping (even gourmet groceries) and subway. Staff was always helpful and though some other hotel guests looked a bit hipstery, everyone was super nice to this 40-something and a kid from the midwest.The rooms are super soundproofed - we heard a voice in the hallway but once they went into their room, we heard nothing. The cocktails are AMAZING. My friend and I grabbed a cocktail from the 1st floor bar and enjoyed them on my terrace - perfection.Elevators/lifts were always available. I mention this because it's a hotel pet-peeve for me - when there are no elevators or you're packed into the one working elevator.Drawback - we didn't mind this but there was a TON of noise coming from the Holland Tunnel traffic. Apparently honking gets you through the tunnel faster. But like I said, in a Soho hotel we weren't surprised by this and even left our terrace door open whenever we were in the room.Price wasn't cheap but only a bit more than a standard midtown hotel.

The beds are comfy and there's something reminiscent of building pillow forts as a kid about climbing into a king-size cubby to sleep. The motorized blinds were a neat touch and kept out the light until the sun came up. The rain shower was a good shower. Those are the positives.The design of the bathrooms is one of my biggest gripes. I don't really have a problem with the concept of the frosted glass, it's cool. What's not cool is the 2-inch gap around the glass-panel barn door and no exhaust fan when you need to...take your time but you're not the only one in the room. Makes for unpleasantness. The other gripe with the bathroom is the toilet paper. At $200+ per night, they should be providing something closer to AngelSoft or Charmin. This is some 1-ply nonsense. Maybe they can claim it's 2-ply but those 2 sheets are tissue paper thin and soft is not a word I'd use to describe it. The mini-fridge is the tiniest I've seen. Makes a college dorm fridge look absolutely spacious and it only kept things cool, not cold. They say, ""Our ... boutique hotels provide 4-star accommodations without the fuss."" The problem with that is 'the fuss' is what makes the accommodations 4-star.The whole room (including the bathroom) is 150 square feet. They call it a ""micro guest room"" which is accurate. Cleverly cramped.I've updated their description (in parentheses) of the City King Room for them: An alcove (wall-to-wall, because the room is as wide as the bed is long) king bed, pegboard closet (wall to hang things on) and convertible flip-down desk (that converts to not-a-desk, that's all, it's a desk or it's not) populate the space while the sizable windows (are normal size but in a tiny room feel bigger) overlook the breathtaking city landscape (traffic on Canal Street honking/waiting to get into the Holland Tunnel). Touches of considered design can be found throughout (the 150 sq ft expanse) including solid walnut furniture, glass-enclosed rain showers (there's only one) and handmade porcelain tiles (your feet won't know the difference). Easy-access technology like electronically-controlled lighting (it's 2017, all lighting is electronically-controlled, they're called light switches), bluetooth radio and bedside USB charging stations (like any other 3-star or better hotel in 2017) are also features.For my money, I'd just as soon stay in a more traditional hotel. This felt more like a very expensive hostel without the dorm-style rooms. It was a unique experience for sure but I wouldn't do it again.",,Nicholas W,6,3.0

So terrible we almost stopped our holiday there and then to fly 6000+ miles to get home. That was not feasible or sensible. Our booking was non refundable but when i called them 4pm day we were checking in they cancelled the room that wasn't not yet charged on my credit card, saving us close to $2k - i was frantic on the phone but i didn't tell them what was going on. I did effectively arrive at the hotel grieving a loss. I was alone but felt surrounded by friends. Hats off to the majority of staff. I was surprised at the size of the room when i arrived but the terrace was LOVELY. I enjoyed the outdoor space which was larger than the room. I definitely needed it for 5 days. Which became 6 days when we had flight issues and delays. The room is well designed and utilises every inch. I had a piece of luggage delivered before i arrived so had to keep that in storage otherwise can't move in the room. The lobby is beautiful, spacious, lots of electric outlets etc. The reception staff...90% are super sweet and helpful...10% are disinterested but that was fine by me. Special shout to Lindsey who was so sweet and chatty, and even got me an invoice for our JFK taxi transfer via email mere hours after i asked. She helped us load our luggage - she's an asset to this hotel. I can see other colleagues doing the same to other clients too. That's why i'd say 90% of the staff are brill. The toilet in the terrace room is separate (not a glass box within the room as previously described). I found the location more than ideal, 50 m walk from 24 hour convenience shop. 5 min walk to all the action in SoHo, Greenwich village, 10-15 min walk to Chelsea / meat packing. I would say noise levels are not great in the hotel you can definitely hear cars. I still slept well the bed is great. We had a problem flying out so i called them from the airport after we checked out, they price matched an online deal we found and included breakfast. This really helped, having someone reliable to count on after an airline left us in JFK for 7 hours waiting....all in all i would 100% consider staying again. I would only go for terrace room as without the outdoor space, the room is too cramped for more than a couple of nights. I did bang my knee multiple times on the bed frame. I am super clumsy though :) Thanks Arlo...maybe see u again. Oh and finally, how about some free filter coffee? My gosh $4 a cup is a wee bit steep even for NY!!!

First important thing to know, the room is small. Very small. Its adequately furnished and clean and they make good use of the tiny space with clever design/layout. The photos make it look not too bad but it is smaller than all the small european hotels we've stayed in, and that's saying something!Second important thing to know is that the bathroom (shower and toilet) is IN the room, behind a glass 'room' door which has a large open gap (it doesn't fully close or seal) which means it is not soundproof (or smellproof!) If one of you is in bed, the other is basically on the toilet by your head. And you can see the person through the blurred glass. It's a bit awkward to say the least. I read the reviews where people mentioned this fact, and I laughed because my partner and I have been together a long time and not much is private anymore, so I thought ah we'll be fine! But this was actually bad. Comically so. Our room was noisy, as the hotel is so close to the busy Holland Tunnel so cars honking, trucks etc.... but its NYC... so its to be expected!The good news is the Arlo lobby area is beautiful, lots of seating and chill out space so if you need to escape your cramped room, you can. The staff were great, very friendly and helpful.The rooftop bar, while expensive, is worth a visit. The 24 hour bodega in the lobby sells nice snacks water coffee etc but note; there is a convenience store 50m down the road with water a third of the price and much cheaper snacks. The location was ok, but a bit of a walk to the main hubs which wasn't ideal. We wouldn't stay here again, as the room was just not an experience we'd like to repeat. We moved over to the lower east side and we had a large room with incredible views (for any first time visitor to NYC I'd recommend staying in that area) BUT I would visit the Arlo rooftop and downstairs / outdoor bar again as it was really nice!","Melbourne, Australia","my_advice_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",27,3.0

The room was small but perfectly formed, and I would have been very happy had it not been for the awful air con.It was absolutely boiling hot in New York in June, and the air con in the small room was blasting out warm air. We told the front desk twice and nothing happened. The third time they sent an engineer who managed to get it to stop blasting out hot air for a while, but couldn't get it to cool, so we had one almost comfortable night. He came back and managed to get it to cool but only if you got up and pressed a button (it then stopped 5/10 mins later). So when it was unbearable in the middle of the night, this was all we could do. The engineer said that they had problems with the air con in many of the rooms. The whole experience of having to awkwardly sit in a tiny room while some guy stands there trying to fix the air con was also a bit depressing.I was 6 months pregnant, so things were pretty uncomfortable as it is, but the lack of concern from the staff was pretty shocking. They paid lip service to the issue ""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be very difficult"" but didn't actually really do anything. On check out, I expressed concern that they were going to put someone else in the room, and the girl apologised - each time it was as though they had not heard of this matter despite it being ongoing all week - and offered us a free coffee (which turned out to be filter from the lobby). They also wrote off an order of chips to the room.Says it all really.We also used their airport taxi company which was a disaster. I wish we had just used Uber as originally planned. The guy not only couldn't follow sat nav (he kept turning between the bridges) but also was on the phone the whole time and I did not feel safe in the car at all.","London, United Kingdom","Vintage_MooMoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",4,2.0

My friend who lives in NYC snuck in ahead thanks to staff and left us some treats in the room which was a lovely surprise to be welcomed with. The hotel is great, very modern and spotlessly clean. The communal areas are lovely, very relaxing and plenty of space to work or read. We also had a quick lunch in the adjacent restaurant when we arrived and were waiting for our room - it was delicious!Staff are friendly but not overbearing and more than happy to help with recommendations.In terms of the rooms, they are tiny but have everything you need and are well thought out in terms of storage etc. The beds are really comfortable and its fun having the big windows with city views. Location of the Arlo is absolutely perfect - we walked everywhere! Soho shops and restaurants are a stones throw but you can also get to Greenwich, East Village and Tribeca easily. We walked all over the city from the hotel including along the high line, up to and around the park and even over to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. I honestly think its such a good central spot to be based in.My boyfriend actually popped the question in our teeny tiny room (which was hilarious - he just about managed to get down on one knee in there!) so Arlo will now always hold an extra special place in our memories.

The hotel is in a great location, just five minutes from the heart of Soho and about a 10 minute walk into the heart of the West Village. We've visited NYC several times before so it was important for us to stay in a hotel that wasn't Midtown and away from all the first time tourist attractions and we couldn't have picked a better spot.The hotel itself is extremely modern and reminds me of the Hoxton chain in London and Amsterdam. The staff were really friendly and helpful, especially Lindsey who checked us into the hotel and always remembered us.The hotel has a great rooftop bar which we went to for drinks on Saturday evening. It has a great atmosphere although drinks are pretty pricey. The only disappointing thing was that for such a great bar there wasn't really a wine list - just a house white so not great if you enjoy a nice wine.There's nothing really to fault with the hotel. The one gripe we did have was the bathroom in the room. Reading from other reviews quite a few people feel the same - there is zero privacy. The sliding glass door doesn't really cover the bathroom properly so you'd need to feel pretty comfortable with the person you're travelling with as you can hear and see in the bathroom when someone is in there.

Thought that pretty much everything about the property is great, just didn't have enough time to spend in the communal areas. The rooms are small, being a micro-hotel, - but I think most people understand that is the point though. Really well appointed, thoughtful inclusions and a quality, younger, hipper vibe to the place compared to other properties in NYC that would pitch around the same price range. Sure, you might get a bigger room but a lot of the older properties even after renovation are pretty seedy feeling - whereas the Arlo had a very fresh feel. I think 2 people in a room is probably a little squeezy, especially with more than 1 suitcase, but if you are using it as a base for sightseeing or meetings while in the city and not expecting to throw a party, then it is ideal. Front desk staff were especially sweet and helpful, in particular Lindsey and Abby. Only issue, which is not really an issue, is that the location is a little outside of SoHo proper, but for me, anywhere Manhattan is fine as a train, cab/uber or walk is easily doable. Would definitely stay again.","Los Angeles, California","ljl84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,5.0

She booked a Queen room and BA advised that they would make the hotel aware of the special circumstances to see if the better of the Queen rooms could be reserved.We arrived tired and shattered at 10:30 to find that the last Queen room (226) had been allocated to us with some rather noisy A/C plant outside. BA had not contacted the hotel!This was brought to the attention of the staff and they immediately responded with an upgrade to a King room, which was fantastic with all the amenities that one could want. Fantastic shower, modern compact layout, really good TV and motorised blackout/sheer blinds.The buffet breakfast was great and the rooftop bar with views of the Hudson was fantastic. However, the staff really make the difference in this hotel and go the extra mile to make you feel like a special customer. If I could single any one person out, it would be Lindsey! She took control of the original situation in a really friendly and supportive way. She was always there for us throughout our stay and was always attentive ant every time we came across her, going out of her way to find out if all was ok and if she could do anything for us. It was brilliant, after many hours of traipsing 'round Greenwich village to find a birthday card wishing me a happy 60th with several gifts of locally-crafted snacks .... we were extremely touched.To add to the foregoing, the location is great, 20 mins walk from 1 World Centre and 12 mins walk from Greenwich Village with the Metro 3 mins away.We would heartily recommend this hotel for the warmth, customer care and enthusiasm of the staff, especially Lindsey, the great rooms/facilities and the fantastic location, nit forgetting the fantastic buffet breakfasts and great free WiFi signal through all of the hotel.","Croydon, United Kingdom","Seanie1957</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Croydon, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

You can watch tv, chill in the sofa groups or enjoy a cup of quality coffee from the café. The rooms are small as they all are in NYC but they are well adapted with efficient storage and one doesn't need any more space because of that. The bed is really comfortable and the double quilt is wonderful and makes you wanna stay in bed and relax yourself. Also there is a roof-top terrace which has a great view of the area and also a sneak peak to Hudson River. The hotel offers bicycles free of charge which is really great as you can bicycle along the River for many kilometers. The only 2 things that bothered me a bit was the massive traffic and honking from cars waiting to drive through the Holland Tunnel. And also quite loud music from the rooftop terrace when private parties was held there.

The location is great, and the free bikes were brilliant ... it's only a couple of blocks to the waterfront bike path which you can take out to Harlem or around the southern tip and over to the UN Buildings. Lots of amenities in the area (City Winery, Acquagrill) and very close to the Canal St subway station with the blue A-C-E line. Also a nice walk to Greenwich V., Chelsea, Tribeca, or Union Sq. The staff were absolutely great and they make a terrific coffee in the lobby. Breakfast was decent ... they provided one on the house and a room upgrade to a King room as there was a workman in my room when I checked in. Nice touch. The hotel was very hip and you would definitely be out of place without an Apple product, newer the better! But as an older traveller I felt right at home and without hesitation would stay here again.","Ottawa, Canada","MikeTraveller00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",12,5.0

Dirty sheets in the bed upon checkin was not a great at start - there no follow up or communication from management following this issue which was disappointing. An air conditioner that has a mind of its own and will heat your room to a balmy 80 degrees in the middle of the night, 3 am wake up feeling like your are lying on a pavement in the tropics without having had water for 3 days (2nights in a row). I tried to report it to reception but it was always so hectic - so emailed instead on day 1 - no reply, 24 hours later I rang through to escalate the issue. Was put to a manager and was treated well and problem was resolved to my satisfaction - again it was regrettable that I had to escalate it - just pay attention to the details, respond to emails etc.Few other items to note - the rooms are nice but small - bring your Tetris skills to arrange bags so you can get to bed, lifts get busy as there is a rooftop bar so can be a journey to get to your room at peak times. Also it is a security issue as you don't need to scan your room key to get to your floor - this means any person entering the hotel can get to any floor which is a safety issue that should be addressed.So much potential and good elements here.

I was very surprised that even next to the Holland tunnel, the window had great sound insulation, and you couldn't get much of the traffic noise at all. The Blind Barber bathroom products are amazing and the rain shower has amazing water pressure. The bathroom was very clean and had a good design, but I think I'd have different feelings if I was traveling with someone else, as there is only a glass sliding door between the toilet and the rest of the room. There was also a small fridge, safe, fold down desk, speaker (bluetooth enabled), hairdryer and clothing steamer included in the room as well.

The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. Our room, though teeny tiny, was very clean and comfortable. We were in #512, which is a king room with a courtyard view. Be sure to close the privacy blinds if you want privacy from the outside world, but be prepared to have very little privacy in the bathroom area. The sink is out in the open and the toilet and shower are only sheltered by frosted glass that doesn't hide much, especially sound. Though this was at first surprising to us, as was the size of the room (my Mom said it was smaller than a cruise ship cabin), we soon found a place for everything and really didn't get in each other's way much. The bed and linens were dreamy, the shower was fantastic and the noise level from the street wasn't bothersome. Thursday evening we enjoyed jazz in the main bar, along with a few delicious cocktails. To return to the airport, the hotel arranged a car service for us, which was much nicer than taking a cab and the price was comparable. As I said in my title, this hotel is very hip (the majority of guests looked like they were under 35), the decor is contemporary, there's a bodega in the lobby, the main bar, a restaurant, a rooftop bar and patio, lots of areas to work or lounge, and a cute courtyard. I would definitely stay here again. One thing to note: the Holland Tunnel is almost across the street from the hotel, so traffic gets really bogged down in the area.

Close to the 1, 2, 3, A, C, E lines.I enjoy walking and do a lot of it but often take the subway somewhere and walk back or vice versa. The hotel is ideal for that. If you head out of the front door and turn right you are in walking distance of the World Trade Centre site (within a mile). Turn left and you have the West Village up to the Highline area. Head (sort of) straight ahead and you will be in the Wooster Street, Greene Street area of Soho. So great on all three counts.On this trip I arrived via JFK and was able to use the A train from Howard Beach (JFK air train station stop) to within half a mile of the hotel. Very achievable even with a suitcase.I had a queen bed city view room which was on the 3rd floor – I quite liked my view over the small park across the road even though its not much! I believe my room was a disabled access room so a touch larger (!) I was a solo traveller so it was perfect for me. (I was kinda hoping for the room with the enclosed wooden cube bed area just for fun but fair enough ;o)As the hotel decor is funky and stylish I felt the room could have had a little something to give it the same feel – just a decorative touch, maybe a photograph on the wall (call me! ;o) or a touch of colour from a cushion or accessory. It was pretty featureless.The bed was very comfortable. There was a small fridge and a safe – both very useful. No wardrobe just a few hangers on a hook which was adequate. The room has a sink with mirror and plug point and there is a hairdryer for your use. There is a full length blackout blind and sheer blind which can be used together or separately.The only negative point is re the air conditioning – SO LOUD. Maybe us Scots aren’t used to air con like our US neighbours as many reviewers haven’t mentioned it but I felt it was like a loud hoover/vacuum cleaner going all night long. I used earplugs and they really made zero difference. I got used to it but it did affect my sleep. (Also watch out for the corner of the bed nearest the door which was sharp and I gave myself a few sore scratches and bruises bumping into it!)The bathroom is more of a wet room set up with a rubber buffer between the main shower area and the toilet. On my last use of it, this appeared to have loosened and caused a flood over the entire area and out into the tiled area of the room. Nothing a couple of towels couldn’t sort though.The public areas of the hotel are lovely and I enjoyed a quick look at the gadgets and accessories you could buy at reception. I also used the Bodega once and found the selection good and the food fresh and well-priced. Although I didn’t use the rooftop bar due to being out and about it was a lovely feature with cute styling.I came home one night to find ‘The Haiku guys’ in the bar area (in this case girls!) – I think they are fab and it was lovely to chat to the girls. Thanks for my Haiku Sarah ;o)Although I found the Air Con a BIG problem I loved the location and would stay again.((Side note - consider popping into sister hotel Arlo Nomad and check the view from the rooftop bar – fab!))",Scotland,"Lolo737</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scotland</strong>",31,4.0

The location was great, and the room was clean and modern. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the hotel has a great set of lounges and bars. Note, however, that the rooms (or at least our bunk bed room) offers little to know bathroom privacy. Rather, you get a shaded glass stall that does little to block the view and even less the audio. Given that people booking bunk bed rooms are not likely to be couples (and frankly I don't think couples particularly want this either), it seemed like a very poorly planned design.

Also, the hotel has a quiet vibe so a parent might find themselves constantly trying to rein in their little ones excitement.The rooms are basic, but clean and provide a desk, small hanging area for clothes, safe and single wall mounted sink.

We had requested a twin bedroom but upon checkin were told that those rooms were unavailable, so we got a bunk bed room. They were really cool and gave us food vouchers for the restaurant which we used for breakfast one day, and dinner the next. The good: The vouchers were each $75 so we comfortably ate under that amount, and I think the two solid meals we had at the hotel made up for having a bunk bed room. The restaurant service was excellent and the food quality was good; everything was pricey of course. The hotel is super hip and fun (we felt stodgy as 36 year old non-hipsters) and we appreciated the convenience, location - walkable under 5mins to the Canal St and Spring St subway stations, and nice folks at the front desk. We did not take advantage of the rooftop bar as it rained all weekend. :/ Our room was quiet and had a view of Hudston st (Rm 808) - never heard neighbors or hallway noise. The hotel was super clean and tidy, I think the housekeepers did a nice job. Wifi was free and fast. So the bad: It was TINY like European studio tiny. Each bunk bed bed had its' own TV, and the room was configured a bit like a cruise ship where all the storage was super functional, but not spacious. The bathroom door didn't close all the way - it was a sliding glass door - so there wasn't much privacy. The shower also only had a hook-setting to close the curtain, so no shower rod to hang clothes on. Also there was not a closet - just a peg-board like industrial chic rack. We would have appreciated a few more hangers. All in all I would stay there again if the price was right, but for what we paid it was pretty tight in there even for NYC standards.","Arlington, Virginia","LaceyC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",17,4.0

The air/air conditioning wasn't sufficient to clear the steam from the ""bathroom"" the entire day. If I was brushing my teeth, my husband had to be sitting on the bed. I've always felt a room is just for sleeping and didn't need more space than that, but I do require standing area for two people to get dressed at the same time which is not the case here.

I was told that early check in could possibly be an option, but that it depended on availability. When I arrived they were sold out the night before and that was no longer an option. The way they handled it made all of the difference. Jason G. kept us in the loop when it came to the status of our rooms. No request was too obnoxious. After brunch, I offered to inspect my own room to help expedite the process, but he graciously declined my offer... He looked at me and I looked at him and we both burst into laughter...lbvs I was tired and needed to nap. The food in the restaurant was ripped right from the food network channel and it was delish!

The AC turns on with a loud tick and an obnoxious fan noise then bursts cold air for a minute and a half (we timed it! We were so awake!) and shuts off. The room did not get anywhere close to cold, and definitely no where near 66. The unit doing this every five minutes was enough to call down in the middle of the night to change rooms. The manager on duty did accommodate our request to change and we moved almost immediately..... into a room that did the exact same thing?!! Except this one was better because instead of the AC doing this loud obnoxious turn on and off thing every five minutes, the length between bursts of air was every twenty. I guess this is standard and the only reason I write the review. The rooms do not cool off correctly and the sound of the AC unit struggling to cool off the room will keep you up all night.

I see a lot of people complaining about the room size, to be frank it isn't as small as they say ( at least in my opinion. ). We took the twin room that overlooks the city view, and it wasn't crowded in the room - but it would have been better to have an extra bed for the third person. For those who aren't used to walking a lot & prefer eating outside of the hotel and in a restaurant, i wouldn't recommend this because the location isn't the greatest as restaurants are found a couple of blocs away.Nevertheless, this hotel has a ton of positive aspects.  First off, I must say the view from my room on the 10th floor took my breath away. You know those pictures you see on the internet where the bed overlooks the city? yeah, well the room we had was exactly like one of those pictures. When sitting on the bed, you can overlook the buildings that's just beside it and if you look closely, you can see the Hudson River so that's a plus. Quite frankly, this has to be the best rooms I've ever been to. The bathroom was big and it has its appropriate amenities. Secondly, the staff were very friendly and accommodating- from the front desk to housekeeping and the breakfast/dinner room. Front desk people were very accommodating when we checked in and checked out, the waiters / waitresses were very friendly that they would come to check us during our meal to see if everything was alright. I appreciated that very well !!  Thirdly, the food was average. If you're one of those people who expect a luxurious and grand buffet breakfast, sorry to disappoint but this hotel is not it. Instead, their breakfast was very casual and small but very filling to the stomach ! For dinner, it's also very filling since most dish are followed by 3 side dishes so that's very delicious !! I highly recommend the grilled salmon, that was delicious!",,Nad M,1,3.0

It's the most affordable NYC hotel we could find that still had a nice design aesthetic. We had a great view out of room 835. They had a 24-hour kiosk in the lobby where you could easily pick up a quick breakfast, snacks or drinks. The staff was very friendly. And we REALLY appreciated the umbrella that was free to use during our stay. But there were some negatives, too. The location was really awkward. You really had to navigate carefully around the Holland Tunnel entrance (it was a little intimidating) to walk back to the hotel. There are almost no restaurants or coffee shops right outside the hotel. You're only 5 or so blocks from them in Soho/Tribeca, but it feels far by NYC standards. The 24 hour kiosk in the hotel is great, but incredibly expensive ($7 for a bottle of water, which you need because the water from the sink is so gray I couldn't see my fingers through the glass!), although there is a deli right on the corner ($2.50 for a gallon of water there). Other negatives: the bathroom has a sliding door that leaves about a 3-inch gap, making it feel very not-private; and the noise from the rooftop bar made it sound like there was a concert going on all day (although it was turned down at a reasonable time in the night). I see a lot of other people complaining about the size of the room. Yes, it was small, but it's a micro-hotel - that's what I expected. And to be honest, it was a lot bigger than the room I stayed in at another luxury Greenwich Village hotel and a few places I stayed in Europe, so we were actually pleasantly surprised by the size. Despite the issues I listed above, I'd definitely stay here again. I appreciated being able to stay in a cool space, relatively near the Village/Soho/Tribeca, for a reasonable (by NYC standards) price.","Portland, Oregon","ValarieS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",25,4.0

The rooftop bar was awesome and the bartenders were super nice and offered some great suggestions for other bars to hit up! There were a couple of small things that were slightly odd/ took away from the hotel itself. Our particular room had a very odd layout. We stayed in a twin bed room, and it would probably be fine for a couple, but for 2 friends it was odd. The bathroom and shower were open to the room (which we knew when we booked) however our particular room was arranged so that the beds looked directly into the toilet/ shower area. There was glass surrounding the area, but it was a bit awkward trying to watch TV when it was mounted to the shower if your friend was in the shower. The only other negative was honestly the location. The hotel is located right by the entrance to the Lincoln tunnel which made it difficult for cabs.

It's just a block away from Canal Station (on the 1 line) so getting around from here is super simple. Soho proper is just a short walk away so there is plenty of restaurants and shops in the area. This is a very trendy neighbourhood.HOTEL COMMUNAL SPACE: the main spaces in this hotel are pretty awesome. There is a big lounge with plenty of sitting space. They even have board games! There's also a cute little garden patio. They have daily activities in the hotel as well. If you're a social person you would love it! It's like staying in a more upscale hostel. The washrooms are clean, and the stalls are fully private. FOOD: there's no room service, but there's a bodega downstairs where you can buy snacks. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Harold's was really delicious! It's a little expensive, but you get a lot of food for the price. The rooftop bar is great for drinks and checking out the skyline. It gets really busy in the evenings, and it is a very trendy crowd. ROOMS: the rooms are small but well-designed and functional. The bed was comfortable, and the storage is quite efficient. They have both block out blinds and ones that allow some light in... our room faced the courtyard, but with the blinds closed it wasn't a big deal. Loved that the room came with a fridge, as well as a very sturdy umbrella (it came in really handy when it rained all day in NY!). Our only complaint was that the washroom is just sectioned off by a frosted glass wall, so there is very little privacy. If you're sharing a room with someone, prepare to have some awkward conversations about using the bathroom! STAFF: the staff was absolutely lovely. They were very accommodating. We allowed us to check in early since we had arrived about an hour and a half early and luckily a room had opened up. They also offered to look after our bags after checkout since we still had a few hours before our flight.

Arlo scores high in: Service - super friendly and helpful. Left my charger at home and they charged my iPhone at front desk and in restaurant while I ate breakfast and worked. Space. Well designed room that maximizes small footprint and manages to come off airy and warm at once. Lots of public area nooks inside and out with wifi, worked a full day there as did several other guests. Rooftop bar is a plus too! Location is great too.

The hotel and room was spotless and welcoming. Such a good vibe with a cool lounge area and great dining areas. There is a very nice little shop in the lobby where we bought our morning coffees for our long days walking. Very cool and very trendy hotel. Very well connected by the Canal Street Subway which is 5 mins walk across the square. Apart from the traffic jam on the first day (right in the square), not too busy or noisy. My girlfriend was so happy with her complimentary birthday surprise organised by Arantxa! Thank you so much for that! It made her day! We had booked through Expedia who asked for a room upgrade for my girlfriend's birthday. I think we had the best room in the hotel! We were at the top residential floor at the corner of the building, overlooking the main square. I think the other side overlooks just tall buildings with no morning sunshine. Windows give you a great view of the morning sky in the square (where there are no tall buildings :-) ). We only visited for the Easter break so had so much to see and do. I only wish we could have spent a little more time in the hotel at the roof terrace bar which looks amazing from the pictures! Overall I highly recommend this Hotel.

Because I checked before booking, I knew that the rooms were beyond small - microscopic comes to mind - and that there were no closets. So we brought nothing with us but two hanging bags for our dress clothes. The rest of our clean clothes and toiletries went into a very small duffle bag. Luckily the twin beds had some space below them, or we would not have been able to store the duffle anywhere. There is literally NO walking-around space. The toilet/shower is claustrophically tiny with a sliding glass door one foot away from one of the beds. No privacy whatever. But the beds were comfortable, and there was no city noise to disturb our sleep.Had breakfast in the main restaurant on Sunday. Price ($21) not bad for a NYC hotel, except that the ""full buffet"" was the skimpiest I've ever seen anywhere - and that includes Best Westerns and Holiday Inns. No decaf coffee. No breakfast pastries of any kind. No smoked salmon (though listed on menu). Friendly but inexperienced staff.

Nice little hotel, lobby is amazing. Front desk staff was polite, friendly and helpful. Arrived at 3pm and room was not ready, offered a free coffee in the bodega in lobby while waiting. I only waited a few minutes but noticed it got very busy with people coming and going. Space near front desk is extremely tight when two or three people are checking with luggage. You must squeeze between them with your luggage to get to the elevators. Also, it may be my age but the elevators are are a really dark red and black paint, making it hard to see the buttons. A few other people had this issue too. I had a nice room, queen bed with terrace. Thankfully I was aloneness because the room had a full glass door to the bathroom, a pet peeve of mind. What kind of privacy is that? Even if I was with my spouse there are some things I don't need to see. The bed is easily 6-8 inches shorter than a standard Queen bed. I heard the couple in line ahead of me at check out make the same complaint, and the desk clerk assured them it's a standard Queen bed, implying Mayberry beds sizes were different where they were from ( which ended up being Louisiana or something, so, WRONG). I think they hear that complaint a lot and have answer ready. Terrace view was great, lots of light. I found the room to be exceptionally quiet. I never heard a toile flush or shower run as is the case in many hotels. Outlets were in odd places, and no place to hang your clothes while using the steamer provided. There is no iron or coffee pot in the room, but there is a small fridge. Wifi worked fine on three devices.

We went to NYC to do some shopping, catch a hockey game and go to a Clapton concert. We arrived late because of our flight. This was no problem and we were met by friendly staff, both in the reception, the 24 hour bodega store and the roof top bar (where we had a nightcap). We got a room on the 10th floor, with separate beds and a nice view over the rooftops of SoHo. The rooms are kind of small, but smartly designed (like the little detail of two USB ports by each bed, for charging phone/tablet). Good size TV with enough channels.The bathroom solution might be awkward for some prissy non-couples. Half transparent walls that are not soundproof. No problem for a Scandinavian guy like me - you know sauna culture and all that.The room spotless when we came, and was cleaned perfectly every day. There were enough towels, toiletries and pillows. Could maybe have thrown in one of those vanity sets - shoe shine stuff (a lot of snow and salt the first days we were there).We had breakfast one day at the hotel. Nice and fresh continental buffet. I'm used to beverages like juice being included in the breakfast buffet, so I was a bit surprised by the price - butt no biggie. We didn't have time to eat dinner there, this time. The hotel is just a short walk from the Canal Street subway station, so getting uptown is no hassle. I really have to brag a bit about the service. I had ordered a package to be dropped of at the hotel. It didn't arrive on time, due to the ""blizzard"" according to the USPS. The staff in the reception called the USPS for me. The USPS were of no help, and said that the package would be returned to sender unless it could be dropped off while I was there. It arrived at the hotel the day after we left the country...I reached out to the hotel on email. The manager answered promptly and said they would send it to my house. It was a gift for my wife.

On one hand I loved it, on the other I was pretty disappointed.My teenage son and I spent 4 nights at the Arlo in a bunk bed room. The room was very small, but adequate and the beds were very comfy. The location was absolutely perfect for what we wanted to do. (shop in SoHo and do a bit of sightseeing)However, the bathroom situation was bordering on inhumane. I knew that there would be a frosted class door on the bathroom. What I didn't know was that door would leave 3 - 4 inch gaps on either side, so that you effectively have NO privacy in the bathroom. I just don't get it! How can you have a room marketed to 2 people and then not give them a properly closing bathroom door?Also, the ladder on our bunk bed had obviously been broken in the past and then repaired by screwing it directly to the bed frame. (hard to explain if you can't see it) Anyway, that created a situation where it was ever so slightly tilted backwards - making it really hard to climb up and down - borderline dangerous.One of the TV's in our room didn't work. The issue was dealt with over several days, and in the end it could not be fixed, so we were offered to change rooms. By that point, we only had a day and half left in NYC, so moving was pretty pointless.Overall, the Arlo is a very funky boutique hotel that goes out of its way to make your NYC a great one, but there are some pretty big flaws/inconveniences that shouldn't be there in a hotel of this caliber and price. If I found out that they changed the bathroom doors (or if I was alone), I'd definitely stay again.","Vancouver, Canada","hajdejano</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",62,4.0

The first thing you see is the bathroom sink in the hotel room because there's no room in the bathroom.

The bed is bordered by the window and two walls so you had to climb onto it from one side. There are no bedside tables. I have terminal cancer and have to take meds in the middle of the night. I had to climb over my daughter and walk to the sink to take my medicine. The bathroom is made of frosted glass within the room and the door is on a rail.

My brother in law suggested the SoHo area for us and the hunt for hotel room was on. We found the Arlo Hudson Square by the HotelsTonight app. For $150! What got a steal! We even searched a promo code and the HotelsTonight website gives you a $25 off promo code (code - TONIGHT). The area itself is cute and young. The hotel is hipster with hip hop blasting as we walked in. To valet your car a day is $65 which is basically what you would pay for any other garage. We received the BESSSSSTTTTTT service from Emily! Emily blew my mind with her customer service and her knowledge of the city. I asked for a room on a higher floor and got moved from the 3rd floor to the 9th floor. Emily even gave us 2 free drink tickets to enjoy the roof top bar on the 11th floor! The roof top bar was adorable! It was hip with amazing views of NYC! We had a full view of the Freedom Tower!Our room was small with a King size bed. We were not bothered by the size of the room because it's what you expect for New York right?

The spacious lounges, working area, patio,and bar are the perfect places to relax, people watch and meet up with like minded travellers. The small but well designed rooms are equally attractive, but perhaps minimalism has been taken a bit too far! No ledge or bench for your suitcase, no drawer to store things and only a few hooks for hanging up clothes. (suitcases on the floor both awkward and untidy!) No shower door or curtain led to water, water everywhere in the large bathroom. We liked the basin separate, ie, in the room, but could have used a hook or rod for a towel.For peace and quiet our room on the courtyard was ideal and staff were unvariably pleasant and helpful.

The bar and roof terrace have a lively atmosphere, while Harolds does one of the best burgers I've had in NYC. While we were in town, we had the pleasure of looking around Arlo NoMad. If you have a chance, make sure you try the fried chicken and maple syrup pancakes (this was an enlightening moment - realising fried chicken and maple syrup are a match made in heaven.

The bartender let us know he knew about the issue and did wipe it down to show it was clean but it seemed like the finish was coming off and that was causing the stickiness. The room was small but clean and functional. The bed was uber comfortable and the shower was outstanding. The constant switching on and off of the HVAC all night was annoying but pretty standard in NYC. Lighting in the room was tricky to figure out. A Bedside table for phones etc. would be great, although I used the little stool and that worked okay.

Upon check-in, the two front desk attendants greeted us pleasantly even though it was 9pm. They were sweet enough to upgrade us when we asked for a high floor and upgraded us from a Queen to a King room! We were on the 6th floor, city facing, overlooking the entrance for the Holland Tunnel. We assumed because it was such a busy road area that we'd get a lot of road noise but there was very very little road noise.. the noise came from the hallway! The room was modern and cozy for a micro-hotel with a good amount of small amenities built into the room (usb charging ports galore). The bed was firm but comfortable and we loved the little nook it was in with the television and I could just lay in bed and look out the window over the city which was magical. There's a powered sheer curtain and black out curtain which were nice. We didn't do much discovering of the hotel because we were taking in the city but the hotel is centrally located which is nice to get to Battery Park and Times Square, etc. Only thing to beware of is that the bathroom/shower are sectioned off by a sliding glass door and you can hear your significant other doing their business.. we thought it was funny but others may not so I wanted to write it!

This location is located in the Hudson Square area with excellent proximity to Greenwich Village and all of the fun and nightlife it offers. It is walking distance which is very convenient. The room in this one is efficient and small, but it's creatively done. The bed is in a wooden cube, which if I had to find a complaint it would be that the person closest to the window wouldn't be able to get out of bed with our going over the person nearest the door. The front desk clerk was extremely welcoming and wanted to tell us about all of the amenities the hotel offered. There is a bodega, and a meat and three restaurant on the first floor, so you don't have to leave if you don't want to. One thing that impressed us is the only issue we had was the TV in the room would not turn on. This problem was amplified because the Super Bowl had just started. The repairman could not get it to work, but he told us to go to the lobby Super Bowl party and enjoy the game and food for free while he swapped out the TV's. The service was quick, and we watched the second half from the comfort of our cube bed. The shower is very nice, with excellent water pressure and good shampoos, conditioner, and body wash. The room came with a hair dryer, steamer, umbrella, and plenty of towels. We enjoyed our stay and will certainly stay here on another NY visit.","Bowling Green, Kentucky","HanKelly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bowling Green, Kentucky</strong>",257,5.0

The room itself was small, but the space planning was efficient with lots of light. The glass walls expands the room's sense of space (while some people find this controversial, I find this adds an adds luxury element to the design). Large floor-to-ceiling windows with an amazing skyline view and a lot of light, beautiful wood finishes, stylish mid-century inspired furniture, luxe Blind Barber toiletries, high-thread count linens, comfortable mattress and pillows, high-def wall mounted plasma TV...it was actually hard to leave the room, which felt like a luxurious cocoon.The hotel has many ""public"" areas, stylishly decorated with modern furniture, attenuated by mood lighting, unique architectural flourishes.

The Arlo Hudson Square is definitely not a hotel for everybody in that the rooms are exceedingly small and in my case the view out of my window was directly onto the rear of the hotel and construction work. This, however, should not put people off who really just want a comfortable bed, free wifi, clean facilities for showering, a small fridge and TV, in particular as you're there in NY to be out and about seeing the sites.In my case, level 6, the room layout is one whereby you walk in to entry where there is your wash basin on the left, toilet and shower on your right separated by an opaque glass screen and perfectly suitable for one person but I'm not sure I'd be happy using the toilet whilst my husband was showering only separated by a cloth shower curtain. There was a very small writing table with connections to charge your computer and a telephone and lamp; a small fridge; no wardrobe but a set of clothes hangers on a wooden structure for hanging about 6-10 items - and tucked at the end was(very sensibly) a free to use (not keep) umbrella. Then the bed (which was either a queen or king) filled the entire end of the room - in that there was no walking space around it at all. Built in to the end of the bed wall was a large TV, and at the top end were two small built in reading lamps, switches for lights and the day and night shades.So, as you can see, it was definitely a minimalist room, well set out for what it contained, but my only real objection had I been travelling with someone would have been the close proximity of the bathroom to everything else in the room. You'd definitely not have to be worried about any privacy issues with your traveling companion.On the plus side though, it was clean, I didn't have any problems with noise, the bed was super comfy, the staff were fantastic and extremely helpful, your room contained an umbrella and really all that you needed if your plan was to spend most of your time out and about. Downstairs and I believe on the roof, though as it was winter and wet the entire time, were Lounge areas, as there were on the ground floor where you could escape to in order to read, do a puzzle (provided by hotel)relax or eat. There was a lovely dining area, an in-hotel deli. The hotel had made use of every inch of space for those staying there to use. As I mentioned the staff were very good and nothing was too much trouble for them in helping you. As you can see it is certainly a hotel for a specific sort of traveller. I believe they also have double bunk rooms, though I didn't see inside one of them. It was well located for visiting TriBeCa, Soho, Little Italy and Chinatown, and of course train stations within walking distance if you wished to travel further up or down town. For me it was ideal and well priced. I was there for 3 days at the end of my time in the US and it provided a clean room to rest my weary head of a night with very helpful, pleasant staff.

Clean, tidy rooms. Very small accommodations but we don't mind.What we did mind was the intensely perfumed lobby area. The smell hits you as soon as you open the front door. It also wafts up through the elevator to the upper floors. I am sure there are people out there who like the scent and the people at the front desk said they no longer notice it but I can tell you we did indeed notice it and others in the elevators with us commented on it as well. Considering the increasing awareness of allergies and sensitivities, it is hard to believe that a public space like that would push out such a strong smell all day long.Worse still is the fact that this potent smell seeps into the restaurant and really affects the taste of the food. Nobody wants fragrances to mix with the smell of food and it really interfered with our experience.This hotel has a lovely HUGE lobby space with seating of all kinds. So you can understand our confusion about the fact that the reception desk allows for about 6 feet of standing room for people and their luggage while bodies are coming in the front door, going to the cafe in the reception area and people going to and from the elevators have to squeeze by there too -- bizzare design oversight, especially considering the vast lounge areas just behind this awkward and cramped space.Overall a great, inexpensive hotel but, please, enough with the so-strong-we-can-taste-it scent in the lobby!",toronto,"chk40</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>toronto</strong>",19,4.0

The bar has a beautiful terrace which you can't use in December but it didn't stop this on from venturing out into the cold nights to peer at the skyline.Just had 3 issues with room & the hotel:1. Their cards were extremely faulty. I replaced them a total of 4 times in 5 nights because they would get de-magnetized so easily.2. The washbasin which is in the room itself ran milky white water in the hot faucet. This may be due to bad plumbing as chalk deposits may not be filtered out accurately or the construction that was occuring across. It was reported on checking-in but was never attended to.3. The glass shutter that closes away the toilet may look cool but is extremely shaky so it jangles a bit.Other than that, it is a nice space and has one of my favorite lobbies with so many little nooks and crannies with beautiful upholstered furniture, lots of power ports and great wifi to catch up on work.

Let's start with the good! The hotel is in a great location. The rooms had very nice decor and the bed and shower were both very nice. The hotel itself had very nice decor and two great bars. The food and drinks we had at the bar were also very good and we enjoyed their daily happy hour. The roof top bar had great drinks and awesome Christmas decor. The service here was the best in the hotel. Now for the bad. The rooms for one are very tiny, I'm talking the size of a closet tiny. I would not recommend any more than 2 people per room. The very first night we slept there we were woken up by drilling in the walls at 5 AM. I called to the front desk three times and was told all three times it was being taken care of. It continued and I had to get dressed and go downstairs to speak to the manager. The manger didn't even know where the drilling was coming from. Both myself and several other guests were extremely upset with this. The manager did end up giving us the night for free, which is the only reason I am giving them 2 stars and not 1. The next night we decided to go to a nice dinner and needed an iron and ironing board in order to press our shirts, since they do not provide one to you in the rooms. We called downstairs 3 times and never received anything. Your beds are right up against the window in the rooms and the noise level is extremely high. They have very poor sound proofing. I know it's a big city and you will hear noise, but I have been to NYC over 20 times and never had the noise level this high. You are right next to the Holland Tunnel so there is constant traffic. Service at this place is slow and nonexistent. Even waiting for wine and cheese during happy hour took forever. The only place I experienced good service was the roof top bar. While the manager did give us Thursday night free, we have yet to hear from anyone about when exactly our card will be reimbursed. I would't be surprised if I had call again and again in order to make sure this happens. Overall, we did not have the best stay here. I do not think I would ever come back or recommend this place to anyone.

The cubby and the small desk allowed for a surprising amount of storage which offsets the small size of the room. It also has a large flat screen TV at the end of the bed.

All the staff were super friendly and helpful. We valet parked our car (very smooth experience although we did have to go inside since there was no attendant) and since we were trying to get to the hotel's restaurant (Harold's Meat + Three) before the kitchen closed at 11pm, the front desk offered to let them know we had arrived so we could go up to the room briefly before having dinner.The rooms while yes, they are small, are extremely well appointed and well designed. It was a pleasure to have well located sockets with usb options (both sides of the bed, plus extra around the room.) Nice big window, comfortable bed, great shower.The only 2 minor detractions were that we would have preferred thicker pillows since our necks started to hurt (they have lovely down pillows, we just prefer thicker ones with more height) and the shower is only partially enclosed (no door or curtain to separate it), so the area right outside the shower where the toilet is gets VERY wet (the bath mat was pretty well soaked after our 2 showers). But the shower itself is great, good water pressure and nice rain shower head.The common areas are fantastic (we hung out there Sunday morning since we had time before meeting friends). We were offered complimentary mimosas and sat in their beautiful lobby/common space reading the newspaper.And go to Harold's! Our waiter was fantastic and do was the food. I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of both (because we arrived just before closing and restaurants don't often find there footing the first few months they are open). They were spot on with everything and we never felt rushed.

They were offering free 5 minute massages after Black Friday shopping - the best!Rooftop bar which was beautifully decorated for Christmas when we went there on our final night, there is also an outdoor seating area on the rooftop and downstairs. As well as this, there is a restaurant within the hotel, we never actually got a chance to eat there but it seemed quite busy when I did go have a quick look. They also have their own Arlo Hudson bikes which you can rent out for free! Again, we didn't do this but a little perk to the stay.I recommend this hotel if you're not too fussed about space and want to stay somewhere that has a different, but positive, vibe to it.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Jayna K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0

(At least they're open about it.) For travelers unfamiliar with a micro-hotel, it's the latest insult to traveling in comfort or style. A micro-hotel - for example, the Arlo - is pretty much what the term suggests. Micro. A typical hotel room - including the bed and bathroom - measures only 8 feet wide by 15 feet long. The bathroom is actually inside the bedroom, separated from the rest of space only by a thin, frosted glass partition. If you're traveling solo, this arrangement may work. For a couple, it's unacceptable. We traveled to NYC over the Labor Day week, staying just one night in Manhattan. We made our Arlo booking on Hotwire. Hotwire, in case you don't know, reveals your hotel booking only AFTER you've hit the ""purchase"" button. ( Don't use Hotwire if you don't appreciate unpleasant surprises!) It was after we purchased our booking we learned we'd been placed at the Arlo. That's when we started learning about micro-hotels and what hellish experience awaited us.Of course we tried to cancel. No amount of cajoling and threatening would get the Hotwire people to allow us to cancel the Arlo booking. They were simply AWFUL to deal with. Never again.So we showed up at the Arlo, thankful it was only for one night. The Arlo bills itself as a four-star property. That rating may apply to some of the common spaces, but certainly doesn't fit the rooms. Our room had malfunctioning A/C, problems with the hot water, and a TV set that would turn on but got no channels. Oh, and a very large gap under the room door ensured we heard every nuance of every conversation of people walking down the hall in front of our room. (We assumed they could hear us as well.) Ugh!In the Arlo's defense, it was their first real week in operation, and it was NY Fashion Week, so the place was mobbed. The staff was struggling to attend to the needs of all the fussy guests, not to mention deal with all the complaints and mechanical problems. The management was very kind to us: They realized the problems we encountered during our stay were significant, and they gave us a full refund. I was impressed with their professionalism. So here's my thought: If you're traveling alone and don't mind a tiny room where there's barely space to turn around, you'll probably enjoy the Arlo. It's got a hip, swank vibe. If you prefer more generous accommodations, or if you're traveling with a companion, I would pass on the Arlo. You'll be as miserable as we were.","Berkeley, California","commpro</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>",8,2.0

Attention to brand is in every detail- the guest rooms, bars, washrooms, lighting- the music (think: ""You're The One That I Want"" from Grease, covered as a pensive ballad by a chanteuse with acoustic guitar) and the exotic scent wafting through the lobby, which depending on your tastes will seem either sexy or cloying. The rooms have comfy beds, a great tv, a large window with both privacy and blackout blinds, and a nicely-designed toilet/shower area, with the sink and vanity positioned by the sliding frosted doors of the washroom. This area has walls of frosted glass, and a sliding door which allows a large crack when open, something to keep in mind for those with privacy concerns, whether traveling with a partner or a friend. There's a tiny fridge in the nightstand, and a safe in a drawer under the bedframe (which I only discovered on my last day: a brochure on check-in describing amenties would be useful; is it true there's free coffee in the lobby? I never found out). There's a hair dryer and a clothes steamer hanging in cute embroidered bags near the door, but no kettle or coffeemaker. The HVAC is efficient, but loud: it turns on with a startling click and then a dull roar of air, which might disturb a very light sleeper. The public areas are well furnished, stocked with boardgames, books, and free wifi. The first floor has a bar, a restaurant, a 24-hour tuck shop in the lobby, a well-laid out seating area, and a courtyard. On the 11th floor a rooftop bar and terrace is open from 4pm to midnight.Traveling solo, I found other guests too involved with their phones to be friendly in those chic gathering spaces, but the bar staff were stars: Janelle in the main bar and Theo in the restaurant were chatty and cheerful. And a desk clerk solved my phone's inability to connect to the wifi by signing me into the staff network. The hotel is close to Canal station on the 1 line, and a short stroll from Soho and Chinatown.I enjoyed my stay at Arlo, but would have appreciated the touches that other micro-hotels in the city provide, such as a complimentary Continental breakfast, adjustable beds, and access to a hot drinks galley on the guest floors.","Toronto, Canada","Kimberley W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

Though I probably wouldn't want to share the room, as the bathroom sliding frosted glass door is a little too intimate unless you are, and the basin was outside the bathroom which was a bit odd but fine. However, it was THE best shower, featuring a big showerhead, extra showerhead and a fold down wooden seat. Wonderful. There was a hairdryer, clothes steamer, safe and a refrigerator, but no kettle which bugged me as I am a tea drinker and prefer to make my own tea when visiting the US. (You could buy tea in the lobby for over $5.00). The view of the courtyard was lovely, the massive tv rotated on its stand to afford really comfortable watching tv in bed viewing. It was great to be able to open the window for air if you wanted and I liked the automated blackout and sheer blinds. There's no room service, but you could get snacks and drinks 24hrs a day - and there's restaurants and bars there too. The guest spaces were great, you could hang out with your laptop using the free wifi in stylish lovely surroundings. There was a wall where people could leave their tips about what was good in the neighbourhood - a great touch. And there were events for guests like free wine tastings.

People, horns, traffic and cramped spaces. Despite my mental preparations I was still thrown back by just how small the room was. A mere moment after entering the room I hit the floor to ceiling window on the opposite side. Mind you, that this was only 3 large steps from the door. 2 twin beds sit atop a built in wooden wall to wall headboard and bed frame. The space was planned to use every available square inch of floor space. 2 inches of clearance from bed frame to door is a testament to that efficiency. I would have liked to see the headboard go all the way up the wall which would have allowed more vertical space for the peg board closet system to spread out a bit. If that was confusing, it was meant to be. In between the two twin beds was a nightstand and directly above that was a series of evenly spaced holes with tight fitting pegs. These pegs could be arranged in any fashion you saw fit to serve as a makeshift hanging system for 3 or 4 articles of clothing. We used it for our jackets as that was all the room it afforded us. The bathroom... sorry toilet and shower were separated by floor to ceiling glass. It was frosted from about 8 inches up to about 8 inches from the ceiling. So, when your roommate dropped his pants you saw a blur for the most part, yet clearly saw the color of his underwear! However, the glass could have been a bit more frosted as it left little to nothing to the imagination. For family or a couple this is fine but for two full grown men who are on a business trip, it’s a little too open concept. Some things should not be witnesses through frosted glass! The rain shower head was great but allowed a little too much water to flow into the shallow polished concrete shower basin. This would flood the toilet room directly adjacent. However, nothing a pile of towels and dirty laundry couldn’t solve. The lack of ventilation in the bathroom area left the room less than fragrant at times and closer to South East Asia than NYC when the shower was on. A vent would have been a nice touch but what is the saying. Hindsight is 20/20... or your roommates sight of your hind will be 20/20 in this room. The terrace was a nice touch as it made the claustrophobia a bit more palatable. An amazing view of a large black billboard with the word DogPound on it was our main focal point. To the right was a smaller building with a top floor loft which looked to serve no other purpose than to drive home the fact that we had been shoehorned into a sardine can! For all intents and purposes the room was sufficient. Heated and cooled quickly but consider the cubic airspace! It was minimalist and contemporary and served it’s main function... to shield us from the elements. It even had an outdoor shower, which we’re still trying to figure out why it was there. The only explanation is that when the weather permits, it gives you more space than the bathroom. Please don’t take this as a complete list of negatives. I am a pessimist/realist and call them as I see them. The hotel was clean, comfortable, modern, hospitable and was moderately priced for it’s location. Now, on to the hotel staff. This is where the redeeming qualities will come through. The staff is extremely friendly, caring and helpful. Our first night we met a lovely woman named Emily. She quickly welcomed us and helped us find a place to eat. We were under the impression that New York was the city that never slept. Although, true, there is activity 24 hours a day, nearly everyone of the 9 million+ residents stops eating after 10pm. Try finding decent food that isn’t deep fried or made from 20 syllable words after 10pm. No, seriously, try it... it’s like a frustrating scavenger hunt. Couple that with an impossible maze of one way streets and you’ll not be bored from 10pm till 6am! On the second day I fell ill and I mean ILL! Super flu hit me like a baseball bat being swung from a rocket ship. The 150 square foot room became my prison for 18 hours. After 9 hours I couldn’t take it anymore and called down to the front desk where a young woman by the name of Kate answered. I informed her that I was really sick, like way past “man sick”. She was full of empathy and took down a list of items I required to continue living. 15 minutes later she hand delivered each item with the addition of crackers which I had wanted but forgot to ask for. She was like an angel and I want to thank her publicly for her pay it forward act of kindness. You are amazing! All in all I think if you get this hotel at a decent rate it is by far one of the better choices. Just be prepared to get real comfortable with your roommate and if you are not ready to watch their full routine, either get your own room or figure out a schedule to allow for some privacy. Oh and don’t forgot that they loan bikes out. Borrow one before renting a Citibike!",,Michael H,3,4.0

The roof top bar was fantastic, great views and the bartender was really lovely and made a fab Manhattan. We had a great time here. The main areas of the hotel are comfortable and stylish with lots of nice places to sit and read or chill out. The room was lovely and comfortable and would be really great with some improvements. The bed was really comfortable and in a fun alcove type thing. As many other reviews have said the bathroom situation wasn't ideal. The frosted windows were fine but the fact that the door only slides rather than closing completely means there really isn't much privacy and it's a bit awkward when sharing. The space is really well laid out otherwise. I don't know if other rooms were better but the 'city view' that was promised and we paid extra for wasn't great - it was blocked by a large billboard that said 'DogPound' - not exactly the romantic view I was hoping for. The windows also didn't block sound out well at all which was distracting and the air conditioner/ heating system kept coming on and off all night and was really distracting and it was very hot then very cold. This may have been due to bad programming on our part. With some improvements this could be the perfect hotel. Very nice without being extortionate and a very fun vibe to it.

I also liked the location, almost in the SoHo. The Lobby is the best part of the hotel. Unfortunately the rooms are minimal and the toilet is a problem. It is constructed of glass, as in all Arlo hotels (I checked this in the web). And this means no intimacy, we ended up using the lobby toilets. If i pay 246 euros/night and I finally have to use a public toilet, I am sorry but something doesn't work in the conception of this hotel. The rooms are also minimal, and are OK if you are in a short trip with little luggage, but we were two, doing a long trip and the room has no wardrobe and we didn't have were to hang our clothes. When I complained about the size of the rooms they answered me that this hotel was for ""millenials"" (ergo I am old to go to this hotel, next time I will go to a Holiday Inn, for old people like me but very confortable).Also I would like to suggest the hotel direction to low down or to turn of air conditioning, I think it was completely unnecessary to have all the hotel freezing during october.

There, we got a $12 cold and stale ham and cheese (could not bite into the bread) sandwich and $6 yogurt. The room was tiny with a king sized bed pushed against the window.

It consisted of a frosted glass enclosed stall with a sliding door. There was only room for a toilet and shower. The sink was outside.

Simple, clean and chic with a trendy minImalist aesthetic. The rooms are small but designed well enough to maximise space where possible.Staff at the Arlo love to say ""If you need anything just ask"". And if you do who you are will depend greatly on what sort of response you get. The staff obviously have standards and if you don't meet their standards they will treat you differently. They will no doubt deny this and say they treat all their guests equally. However, I experienced it first hand on several occasions and noticed the same with other guests.

Bathroom (shower and toilette) is a built in glass one so whilst it is practical you can hear and partially see what’s going on in there. Sink is outside the glass structure.The bed and pillows were uber comfortable and the whole room is spotless clean - minimalist design and style which I loved.I was in one of the highest floor and facing the city view which was super quiet, you have also the option of the garden view.In summary, great hotel and modern vibe, fab location, great room standard (albeit small) so it’s definitely a fab solution given the price and the NYC hotel standards. definitely recommended.","London, United Kingdom","SebyG1981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

The staff were all great and did everything they could to look after us. The rooms are small, very small. They make this clear in their photos so no-one should be surprised. The biggest issue the no effective segregation of the toilet with the main room. Solo travelers will have no issue but couples will find this a little uncomfortable. Otherwise the small room is brilliantly arranged with smart and clever idea. For example you get a clothes steamer instead of an ironing board. There is no wardrobe but there is a hanging rack and customizable peg board to hang up clothes. Apart from the bathroom situation it was all fun. Where The Arlo starts to shine is when you get out of your room and use the communal spaces. There are several relaxed and stylishly appointed areas on the ground floor, part of which cleverly turns into a bar at night, and a large outdoor courtyard. We had a great time at the bar after dinner, discussing cocktails with the barman and meeting other guests - it is that type of place.This area is so nice you could sit down there all day, do some reading, catch up on work or meet friends. Also on the ground floor is a restaurant the Meat+3. We had breakfast and really loved the refreshing approach to the menu and reasonable pricing. Alternatively you can just grab a snack and coffee to go from the front foyer. Then on the roof is a rooftop bar with ample outdoor seating when the weather is good. Once again this feels like a welcoming and communal space where all activities would be welcome. We loved our short stay at the Arlo. As long as you can deal with the bathroom and small room this is a great place to hang out for a few days in a great part of NY with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby and if travelling for work there would be no better place to stay on a budget.","Melbourne, Australia","Phil D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

We stayed here the 3rd to the 6th October for a shopping trip. The location is fabulous, the hotel is immaculate because it's all brand new. The open spaces are great, the rooms are small but lets face it in NY who wants to be in there room. I was travelling with my boss so the whole sliding door bathroomWhich was see thru is a bit weird it's a good job we both get on and are used to travelling together. For 2 women there is hardly any hanger space but again u can get over that as it's all nice and clean. The restaurant is pants.... we was so tired after a full day shopping that we really couldn't be bothered going back out again but I wish we did the Mac n cheese side was so sickly, the salad bar looked like it was there for ages. The staff were all a bit odd like they didn't know what was going on. The other thing was rubbish was u couldn't get a decent coffee in a cup in the bar bit outside it had to be In Paper cups and that again took ages to do. Reception staff was ok, there was one girl who was brilliant but if you didn't get her then no one again really knew what was going on and the door man was lovely too. This i can get over thou as the location is so good and we wouldn't normally eat in the hotel what I can't get over is the fact that I paid the £900 on check out for our stay and they have continued to hold the £800 from when I checked in. So in total they have charged me £1700 for a 3 nights stay... I have spoke to the hotel and they have given me the accounts email address but I haven't heard anything back and it's been 6 days now. I've stayed in hotels all over the world with my job and never before has this happened. It's a disgrace! When I spoke to my bank they said the £800 will be returned on the 18th October... WHAT A JOKE! So if u do stay here for the location then please give them a credit card not your personal bank account as you won't have your money for 2 weeks!

The hotel was delicate, fresh and new. Staff was very helpful to accommodate us when asking to change rooms for a better view (booked city view). The rooms are small, but efficient and we really did not need a large room given we were out in the city all day. The bed was amazing! We had a king size and really enjoyed the fresh linens and a good night´s sleep every night. The hotel is very close to Spring street, which we walked to almost every night to get to lots of different restaurants/shops. Also easy to get to Canal street subway station. Great rooftop terrace with a nice view and perfect to spend an hour in the sun before sunset after sightseeing. We did not try the breakfast, but I believe it was $22 a person, so we found lots of other cheaper options in the area. Would def stay again next time we are in New York!

However, the service is a bit unorganized and slow. You can tell the staff is trying hard to do a good job but they seem too stressed out or don't know what their roles are just yet. Check-in was not very smooth since I was 5th in a line of some people that seemed to have been waiting for awhile. My husband had to stand at the curb by our rental car because there was a sign for valet but no valet attendant to be seen. No one explained to us the services/amenities of the hotel at check-in like other hotels typically do. We only got the wifi password from eavesdropping on someone else's check in. They also ran out of parking passes/valet tickets for our car so we had to leave our rental car keys at the desk so they could figured things out while we went sight seeing. I was a little worried to leave our keys since everything seemed so unorganized. Four hours later we came back to the hotel and the gentleman still wasn't sure if the valet ticket he had was for our car so he went to double check if the ticket was for our car. The whole Arlo experience was odd and it seemed that everyone we encountered had never worked for a hotel before.

There was maybe about a 10 inch ""gap"" from wall to bed to use as a 'walkway'. I can't tell you how many times I stubbed my leg on the corner of the bed frame... maybe I should just count how many bruises I've accumulated on my shin :/ Considering the size of the room, there's probably no other way they could've positioned the bed, BUT they definitely should have reconsidered the positioning of the tv mounted on the wall which is in DIRECT PATH of the gap between the wall and bed! I felt like I was playing Human Tetris just to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom. Not fun.Aside from that though, I don't have much complaints about our stay. The staff was welcoming and able to accommodate our early 7am arrival (music to my ears after a red eye flight!). The hotel itself is beautifully designed and there are maintenance guys constantly making sure that everything is clean and spotless on the hotel grounds. Although the hotel does not offer room service, there is an adjoining restaurant and rooftop bar with a nice view of the city (both of which were a little pricey with mediocre food, but offered a nice ambiance without having to leave the hotel). There is also a 24 hour deli corner store right next door and the hotel is walking distance to all the shopping and great food west village & soho has to offer. We've visited NYC in the past and did all the touristy things already, so the main purpose of our trip was to eat and shop which is why staying here made the most sense for us. TIP: keep in mind this hotel literally just opened, so it would be wise to keep the hotel address handy if/when catching a taxi ride from the airport to the hotel... each time we've visited the city our cab driver always knew where to go if we simply told them the hotel name, but our cab driver (who explained he has been driving in the city for the past 15 years), was thoroughly confused when we told him the name of our hotel.",San Francisco,"klosada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",4,4.0

We loved the soho location and it's easy to get all over Manhattan from there. The hotel has some great bars and communal areas including the rooftop bar where you can eat takeout. My main complaint with this hotel is the in-room bathrooms. Do not book this hotel unless you are fully comfortable with your travel companion hearing and seeing you use the toilet. The bathrooms are a frosted glass box in the middle of the room, with space at the door for sounds and smells to escape. We had an issue that we booked a twin room through booking.com and were surprised to find bunkbeds in our room - this was definitely not what we had booked and was not made clear at check in. The hotel blamed the way that room info comes through to them from booking.com and they were not able to give us a twin room until our second night. The biggest issue with the bunk room was the lack of space. There was nowhere to sit or relax except the beds and who wants to scale the top bunk every time they need to sit down?I would potentially stay at the arlo again if I was travelling alone but I prefer a traditional hotel room for space and privacy.

Bathroom: This was a bit odd, there was no shower door--just an inch high divider on the ground. As a result, when we showered the entire floor of the bathroom got pretty damp.

The hotel has the charm of a boutique hotel but all the benefit of a larger hotel. Great bar at the rooftop, with a fantastic view to Newark and a glimpse of World Trade, not to forget good cocktails. The lounge area is like being home, but still plenty of room, space to work or just relax in their great furnitures, retro but still very modern. The restaurant had a good buffet with value for the money, still some minor startup problems which I am sure they will soon have fixed with a little more experience.The reception and staff were very service minded and nothing like the snobs' you often meet at the larger hotel where a 20 year look at you like, can you afford staying here, here they were friendly, gave good advise, handled it smoothly and were always available if you had a question.The location is one of the best in Nyc away from the main tourist areas, but still close enough if you want to be part of the crowd, suggestion take a Citibike. Lots of restaurants in Soho and we just loved walking the area from the hotel towards Chelsea, found a lot of good restaurants, not chains but individually owned.Two small points, rooms are small, as for most Nyc hotels, but the space is used to its maximum, and then there can be some noise from the traffic, but then again you are in one of the most vibrant cities in the world,, so all in all a great stay,, see you soon again","Copenhagen, Denmark","Tonny-FR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",15,5.0

I requested to move rooms and they didn't have one available until the next night.-The room is really only meant for one person. I'm from NYC originally, so I'm used to no space. I have a hard time seeing two people be comfortable here.-The restaurant wasn't open but the bartender lets you take drinks up to your room-24 hour cafe downstairs is convenient but it seems nobody works there. I went 4 times and each time I kind of just wait awkwardly at the counter until some hotel employee is done chitchatting 6 feet away and walks over to take my order. Except for one guy who seemed to be missing a hand. He was awesome.-All the staff seem young, eager to please, but somewhat clueless. Nobody knew where extra forks were. I would stand somewhere waiting and be ignored. -Opening night had no hot water. Lukewarm at best.Things that Did Go Well:-I like being able to take drinks from the bar up.-They comped all my food (maybe about $70 over 2 nights) bc the noisy room the 1st night. -The courtyard room really is very quietThings that are.-They gave me a little bag of snacks in recompense for no hot water. Potato chips, a bottle of water, cookies. Ok.-The bed was shorter than the space the had for it, so there's a weird wedge they place under the pillows. I thought it was really uncomfortable and moved it.",,Audrey A,13,3.0

It was bright, welcoming, and sleek. I had a rough day of travel and wanted a drink and the best part was the bar was right past the entrance, well-lit and packed with others who appeared to be just like me, ready for a cocktail. I had an incredible mixed drink that the bartender suggested after I shared that I was a fan of gin. After checking in, which was a piece of cake, I went to my room. It was perfect for me! The bed was surrounded by a wooden frame that went up the walls and across the ceiling. It added instant warmth to the room. What was even better, was that the TV was mounted directly inside the bed frame. The best part by far thoguh, was the large window right next to the bed which allowed me to see the views on NYC (quite the bonus for seeing the sunrise in the morning as well). The beds were comfortable and I heard no outside noise which was a pleasant surprise considering I have stayed in hotels in NYC many a time before and been woken up to the grinding sounds of construction and traffic horns beeping. When I felt like having some background noise though, the bluetooth speaker connected with my iPhone and I was able to plug my charger in right next to the bed as the outlet is built into the bedframe!As for the Rooftop Bar, what a view! It was a beautiful summer day/night and perfect for sitting outside with a cocktail and some friends. My friends and family also stayed at the hotel in their own rooms as we had a wedding to attend, and we all found ourselves to be well-rested and ready for a day in the city. What was truly great was the immense amount of ""social space"" on the first floor of the hotel. We were able to sit in these gorgeous leather club chairs and plan out our day over fairly good coffee (and trust me, I'm a tough critic) from the hotel's very own coffee bar by the entrance of the hotel.Every time we entered or left a public space, the staff would check in with us to see how our stay was or if we needed anything. It was nice to feel thought of in a city that never sleeps and houses millions of people. We knew the hotel had an abundance of rooms and guests were everywhere throughout the buidling, but we were never made to feel like just another number. There was more than one occasion that I was addressed by name by a staff member which really made my day! My family and I will definitely return in the future and will be recommending this hotel to others! It's worth it! Let us know if any future properties open up in NYC or other large cities. I travel a lot for work and would recommend Arlo in a heartbeat!","Maplewood, New Jersey","Kathena24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maplewood, New Jersey</strong>",6,5.0

I loved so much about it I couldn't possibly list it all, but below I'll give a few highlights:First off, when you walk into the building there is a little store, and they have super fun stuff. All of it is sourced in NYC around the neighborhood, and I wanted to buy most of it. The staff at the front desk and really through he hotel were all super friendly and professional. I loved the uniforms!The main lobby is one of the most naturally comfortable lobbies I have been in. There are board games and puzzles all around, as well as a record player with a variety of records to choose from. The furniture also managed to be incredibly chic and comfortable, a rare combination. The same could be said of the entire back lobby area. Upstairs, the rooms feel ten times bigger than they are. My floor to ceiling windows looked out at a beautiful building across the street and gave a glimpse of the skyline- and I was only on the 7th floor! More importantly, the mattress was AMAZING. It is very rare that I go to a hotel and get a fantastic nights sleep, but here I slept like a rock. The pillows and comforter were perfection as well. The room also had a super cool pegboard on the wall that could be adjusted to hang bags or anything else you like. The bathroom, though small, was mighty. The pressure of the shower was perfection and the temperature changed quickly and accurately. The shampoo and conditioner also left my hair feeling smooth and silky- something often not true of hotel hair care. Another perk: they were in big bottles- environmentally sound! In the morning I went downstairs to the restaurant, Harold's, for a complementary breakfast. The menu was pretty standard, but everything was cooked to perfection. They had the nicest bagel buffet bar I have seen, with lox and chia-seed pudding and many more toppings. My time at this hotel was amazing, and I recommend it for anyone coming to NYC for a few nights.","New York City, New York","charlotte899</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0

Ultra luxury! Great attention to detail to make the stay absolutely fabulous. Very high quality furnishings, design, and amenities. The room was very comfortable (even though it was small - but not by NYC standards). It has everything you need. The rooms are very quiet. The public spaces are just beautiful and very comfortable. Lots of nice areas to sit and work, relax, or just hang out. Soho is a great neighborhood, and Arlo is an easy walk to everything. They have a great bar and restaurant. Super roof-top bar/lounge area with a great view.",Ithaca,"J M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ithaca</strong>",0,5.0
