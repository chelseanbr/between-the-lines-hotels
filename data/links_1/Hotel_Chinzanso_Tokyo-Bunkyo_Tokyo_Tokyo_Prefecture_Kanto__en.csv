Surrounded by a lovely garden with a stunning old three-tier pagoda, this hotel is a dream: great service, comfortable rooms, tasteful furnishings and, probably, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Has a spa, and a pool, a few restaurants and could be a destination in itself.

There are ample parking spaces (up to 400) available and for guests staying a daily parking fee of 1,000 yen is charged. After a simple registration we were shown to Room 929, a Prime Deluxe King with Garden View.The room is very spacious, about 60 sq.m, with a sitting room having a large writing desk, a sofa and marble side table, along with a comfortable king-sized bed. There is a separate powder space with vanity, before entering into the bathroom with bathtub and a shower stall. The toileteries are also premium, from L'Occitane.As the hotel is famous for its garden, before getting too dark we went for a walk. The garden entrance is located on 1/F, and after coming out from the hotel, we walked down a U-shaped slope through the woods, and soon saw the Monument of Chinzanso, with the engraved words of Duke Yamagata Aritomo when he named Chinzanso in 1878.Crossing the beautiful red Benkei Bridge, there are 20 or so Rakan stone statues, representing some of the 500 rakan drawings by Ito Jakuchu, a famous painter in the middle of the Edo Period. Each of the statue is about 50 cm tall.Continuing there is the Koshin Stone Monument. Carved in 1669, it depicts the beliefs of the Koshin school of Taoism. In front there is the Yusuichi Pond. It was created when the garden was first constructed, with a gourd-shaped having a lot of big and beautiful Koi swimming inside.Further along there is a famous well called Kokosei, with the quality of the spring water being recognized as the best in Tokyo. Beside the well there is the 13-tier granite monument honoring warrior tea master Oda Yuraku, the younger brother of Oda Nobunaga, the famous military commander.Along the path we saw the statues of the seven gods of fortune. Ebisu is the god bringing business prosperity and fishing success, also serving as the protector of those who loves the sea, fishing and sailing, as evidenced by the fishing rod and sea bream he is holding. It is also interesting to see the staff preparing the raincoat for the gods on the day.Soon we reached the two buildings in the garden, one being the restaurant we were going for dinner on the night, Mokushundo. The restaurant offers unique iron-kettle and stone-grilled kaiseki cuisine, while the other is the historic Zangetsu Teahouse. Baron Fujita relocated the teahouse from a villa in Hakone and now is recognized as a Tangible Cultural Property.Continuing we passed the sacred tree, the oldest tree in the garden at about 500 years old with a trunk of 4.5 metres in circumference and 20 metres high, before seeing two more of the seven gods of fortune: Jurojin, the god of longevity, and Hotei, the god of luck.Then we came to probably the most famous monument in the garden, the historic Entsukaku Three-Storey Pagoda. Relocated in 1924 from a temple in Hiroshima Prefecture, this legendary pagoda is said to have existed since around the 12th century. Tests show that many of its materials date from circa 1420. During a major renovation, it was consecrated in honor of Kanzeon Bosatsu, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy.Beside the pagoda there is also a stone lantern, dated to the late Kamakura period (14th century), and praised by many experts as a masterpiece of the Hannyaji style. Coming downhill we saw two other seven gods of fortune: Bisyamonten, the god of wisdom and bravery, and Fukurokuju, the god of fortune, wealth and longevity.Then right in front we saw the crystal chapel, in which the hotel is famous for, and no wonder it is a premium and popular place for weddings. The Gojo waterfall beside has a 'hidden passage' where one can see through the waterfall to the garden.Returning to the hotel building, we came across the last two of the seven gods of fortune: Benzaiten, the goddess of music, eloquence and fortune, and Daikokuten, the god of the five cereals.After wiping ourselves dry with the towels provided, we went to the lobby lounge Le Jardin for afternoon tea. Looking at the greenery while comfortably sitting in the elegant sofa and table, I had the Dessert Set (1,900 yen), enjoying a rich and tasty New York Cheesecake with Strawberry Ice-cream, and a cup of coffee.After a good sleep, on the next morning we went to the Japanese restaurant Miyuki for breakfast. With an elegant and traditional atmosphere, the hearty breakfast includes Salmon and Grilled Vegetable in Sweet Vinegar, Pickled Plum, and Small Dishes of the Day; Japanese Grated Yam; Boiled Vegetable Oshitashi; Simmered Eggplant; Grilled Fish of the Day; Rolled Egg Omelet, Grated Daikon Radish, Salted Cod Roe; Steamed Rice, Pickles and Miso Soup; and Fresh Juice.Another compliment I have is that the hotel concierge was very helpful in purchasing tickets for the recently opened Snoopy Museum, saving us the time later to queue up. Overall we were very satisfied of our stay in Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo, with spacious and comfortable room, delicious food, impeccable service and the really nice garden. It is worth every penny I pay for.Prime Deluxe Room with Garden View (including breakfast for two) - 68,460 yen","Hong Kong, China","Peter C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",159,5.0

Vanished, and Hello Gorgeous.I stayed two nites to pick up some Sake, no that's not the reason, did you think I was crazy?After a long 18Hr flight from Australia [4 hour connection in Singapore] I decided to break up my air travel with two nites in Fabulous Tokyo. I began reading reviews right here on Trip Adviser and Thank You [Yorkieboy61] and his review along others, I decided to check it out, I already love the area.I arrived early morning, looking like I flew in Cargo [deep discount economy] all the way, and yet I was greeted warmly with big smiles... and it continued this way for 29Hrs. They must have taken pity on my because I was checked in, upgraded to a suite and shown to my room within minutes.My room was located on a high floor, and a great view of the city. The suite was large, and the bathroom even larger... well it seemed that way to my jet-lagged eye's. Plush towels, L'Occitane amenities and a great big ole king size bed, allowing me two perfect nites slumber... ZzzzzzI was in Tokyo this past November and holiday spirt was in the air, and my Centurion needed some action, so after a long hot shower and room service, I ventured out sightseeing and shopping, after all I needed Sake... The Hotel Chinzanso, [like the former FS] is an enormous hotel and I swear there were 1,000 weddings taking place or maybe a couple, so I stayed away from that part of the hotel, and though I heard the hotel had a wonderful Gym, [so so so sad I had no gym clothes packed ;-p] also an amazing Spa [I did my spa-ing in Australia] I can't wright anything about them or where they are in the hotel.I had four meals within the hotel, once at ll Teatro, once at Miyuki Shut-The-Front-Door amazing yum yum yummy... too bad it was on my last nite... and twice room service.I have not an ill word to write about this Five Star property, but should you stay elsewhere [shame on you] you have to dine here!Travel can be harsh, be kind to your fellow traveler and enjoy the world and its diversity.","New York City, New York","TheTrvlGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",252,5.0

Hotel was nice , rooms reasonable size and well appointed in slightly old fashioned style. Staff is amazing and only too happy to help with anything you need in all areas of the hotel. Main downside for a tourist is this hotels location which is not close to any major centre. It’s a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest subway station that is not on a convenient line so going to any major location requires transfer(s). As such you might find taxis as easier but more expensive transport alternative. Otherwise a very pleasant stay !!

Our room was huge by Tokyo standards, the staff was nice but not intrusive. Nice little extras like maple baumkuchen, good coffee/tea, and L'Occitane products. The location is a bit away from the other tourist spots and we found this to be a plus, even if we had to walk a bit more and take a few more cabs.

We wanted to stay in a Tokyo hotel which would give us a sense of occasion and this hotel certainly lived up to that promise.This is obviously a luxury hotel (replete with luxury hotel price tag) and the rooms, service and garden setting are all magnificent. It sits high atop a hill in Tokyo and the city views from our room were expansive and certainly gave a sense of place and a feeling of space. As others have mentioned, there doesn't appear to be a buffet breakfast, and the set menus in Il Teatro (the breakfast room) are a little restrictive. Of course, by the second day, we learnt to push things a little and ask for some cereal, which was of course not a problem. As we were slow to realise, nothing would be a problem here, because the hotel is so focused on giving great customer service. (Yoshinari Chinen was such a welcome face every morning at Il Teatro. What service he gave to us! Thank you!)And the service everywhere in the hotel, from concierge to wait staff, was everything you could wish for. Unfailingly polite, extremely helpful, amazingly patient.We only ate in the bar at night as our days were long and involved much walking and we only wanted a snack. The bar menu was small but lovely and caters for those less inclined to dress up or spend big. Be warned, the bar doubles as a cigar lounge but we were offered a seat outside in the entrance area and found it perfect to our needs. (The service by Tomaoki Oshino here was fabulous! He ""got us"" straight away and hence the reason why we went back on our last night.)Walking to the nearest subway was not an issue for us - you can take the pathway through the garden and then stroll along the river, or you can head down the hill (faster) to the busy street, where you also will find a 7Eleven and a Lawson's, in case you need a few supplies. What we didn't realise was that there was a bus stop outside the hotel which would take you in the opposite direction to the Toden Awakara Line, the last streetcar line in Tokyo. One of our must do's for this trip was to catch this streetcar, however we headed off via the subway and caught it from a completely different location, not realising it was up the road. You live and learn.This hotel proves that great service is alive and well. If you want to treat yourself to a lovely stay, you couldn't find a nicer place.

You absolutely can say nothing negative about the service at this hotel - everyone I met on their staff was unfailingly polite, prepared, accommodating, and kind. We utilized a couple of the restaurants, mostly The Bistro because we wanted some Western food in addition to the Japanese food we had while touring. It was very good quality and variety. The location is a short cab ride to the subway, which was convenient, but we utilized taxis mostly so it was fine for our purposes. They handled the typhoon like champs - little to no interruption in services at the hotel. We felt very safe and cared for during that time due to the attentiveness of their staff. As a side note, we are Catholic and stayed over a Sunday, so we were pleased that the Seikiguchi Cathedral is literally across the road and walkable from the hotel.

The hotel itself is a true 5-star expirience but what really sticks out is the service level from all the staff. Since Tokyo is such a spread out city and you anyhow need to take subway or train to get to many places the location was good and only a 10 minutes walk to the closest subway.

I have been to a few luxury hotels that are unfortunately classless. Some would expect a lot of tips for just doing their job description, nickel and dime on service charges etc. Hotel Chinzanso is the opposite. It sees going above and beyond as a requirement, like its simply what it is supposed to do. Not to mention all the small but sweet touches, such as a hand written welcome note from the manager, boiled hot water for tea and a box of snacks, a hand folded paper crane for good luck, as well as a local cellphone for each room’s guests to use during their day trips free of charge. And did I mention the property itself is just beautiful. The garden is of course gorgeous, but all the decorative antique items placed throughout the hotel is equally worth looking at. The only “downside” is the location. It is in a residential neighborhood; so unlike my friends hotel which is located at the heart of Ginza, it does not have any convenient stores or many cool and popular restaurants by its door steps. The hotel itself has a number of restaurants. We have eaten at a couple of them and they are pretty tasty. But their prices are at higher end and some requires advanced reservation. I feel for the same prices, you probably can find sth even better somewhere else. It is also a 10-15 minutes walk to the nearby subway station. However, if you mind the walking, taxis are always waiting right outside the hotel lobby. Because the hotel is centrally located, taxi fairs to most Tokyo major attractions are relatively reasonable.

The room was supposed to be ready at 3pm but we were told we would need to wait 5 minutes for housekeeping to finish. I know it’s a silly thing but at £265 a night you don’t expect that.Our room was large and really nice but the hotel exudes a sort of faded grandeur. All marble and mustiness. Apparently it is due a refurb in June 2019 and it needs it. We decided to head straight down to the spa. By the time we got down there after all the check in faff it was 4.45pm and we were told the pool closed at 6pm. So it meant we had spent a load of extra cash for spa passes that we could only use for an hour (it opened again at 10pm for two hours but we had show tickets). The spa itself was really nice though and had loads of toiletries to use in the ladies which felt luxurious. The outdoor sauna was lush! We went out that evening via the garden entrance and when we returned, it had been locked up. No one told us it closes. It meant we were walking in circles around Tokyo at 12.30am trying to get home.When we got to bed, we went to sleep straight away. We needed to be up at 6am to leave for the airport. However we were kept awake pretty much all night by what sounded like a muffled alarm beeping. We checked everything in the room - that the phone wasn’t off the hook etc and the only thing we think it can be is the lorry yard that our room overlooked and the poor insulation. On top of that, every half an hour there were loud creaky squeaks of what sounded like a cart being pulled around and loads of banging. It was awful, I didn’t sleep a wink.Another thing is its location. It’s a good 15 mins walk from the subway and we found it took ages to get anywhere as it is on a really awkward line. I wish we had saved our money and gone somewhere else. Oh and finally, this was the only hotel which made you pay the full booking cost if you cancelled within 14 days. Every other hotel and guesthouse (we stayed at another 5) offered much more flexibility and allowed you to cancel for free up to 48 hours before. The only thing about the hotel that’s great is the posh toiletries you get and the beautiful garden. The staff are pleasant. I did complain about my stay but the language barrier was an issue and the guy was really dismissive.","Leamington Spa, United Kingdom","travellingnic0la</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leamington Spa, United Kingdom</strong>",116,3.0

On attendance to the hotel, we were escorted to our room and advised on the key areas for further information. We were extremely grateful to be offered a prime superior room on the top floor which offered breathtaking perspectives of the Tokyo city skyline. I imagine the rooms overlooking the gardens are equally impressive. The room was clean and comprised of all the key amenities and equipment, including integrated plugs which accommodated a UK plug. The service team were polite and considerate during both morning service and evening turn down service. We additionally had breakfast and the occasional dinner room service. Service was rather literally to the minute (for pre-ordered breakfast requests) and was both tasty and presented well. The gardens were beautiful and made a welcome contrast to the busy central Tokyo business districts. We attended the hotel language class with the best service manager which was very helpful, particularly as there was limited conversational english in some parts. Overall-the attentive staff and well presented hotel environment were a large part of our immersion in the Japanese culture and contributed to an excellent stay. We are due to travel to Japan in late 2019-early 2020 with the main focus on Kyoto, however following our experience will aim to stay 3-4nights in Tokyo.

And the food and service was excellent.We also had breakfast-which was also very good. The afternoon tea looked very nice, and they do offer some experiences which we did not have time for.One of the best things-was the free phone they offer in each room.

Making them aware that I was part of a large group (> 200 people on a multi day business gathering right there). No impact. After noon time asked again for my room or any room, and they insisted ""rooms are ready, but still have to pay USD 280 for the three additional hours, I would get mine by 3pm"". Ridiculous. I asked that if I then check out at 7am (i.e. 5h before official check out time), if they would pay me back the difference, but they did not even get the irony of that. Short before 2pm I asked a third time for the room (remember, empty available rooms have been there with no claim for hours), and this time they had guts to tell me now it would cost me ""only"" USD 145 for this additional hour before ""official check in time"". Asked to speak to the manager on duty, and that was the manager duty already.... As a global business traveller with dozens of trips in a year, this is the worst greediest service ever seen by a front desk! Normally the review would be ""terrible"", but then again, it seems a bit unfair, because the hotel is really nice, great big rooms, immaculate cleanliness, excellent restaurant, and the rest of the staff truly took great care of every thing (although, comparing globally with hotels of similar standards, expect to over-pay 1.5-2.0-fold).

Their spacious garden and precious onsen attracted me to come back. However, I have some complaints about my recent visit to Chinzanso— the onsen.First, the open-hour of the spa is too short, which opens from 8:00 am – 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm – 10:00 pm. At 8:00 am, the guests may be right at the restaurant enjoying their breakfast or just finishing it. Considering the guests are used to checking out from 9:00 to 10:00 am, though the official check-out time is 12:00 at noon, one has very limited time to use the spa. At evening, the spa closing at 10:00 is too early. Like our case, we finished our dinner in Mokushundo at about 9:00 pm, then we had to go to the spa with full bellies in a hurry.If the open hours can begin at 6:00 am and end at 12:00 midnight, that would be much more convenient for guests.Second. We visited the hotel during Chinese New Year holiday, and the guests from China mainland were more than usual. When I went to the spa, the gentleman at the reception showed me a guide for how to bath in an onsen in simplified Chinese characters, which I have not experienced during my previous stays. After taking a glance at that guide, I nodded to him. The gentleman seemed suspicious about my understanding of the guide and showed it to me again. At that moment, I told him: “I have been here for three times.” and he breathed a sigh of relief.I understood that some guests from PRC might not be familiar with the onsen manners, and I also respected that this gentleman was doing his job. However, for me, a guest having visited more than 60 Japanese onsen ryokans, it felt kind of insulting at that moment.The Hotel managers are better to know that: Chinese-speaking people are not all from PRC, and most of them know the onsen manners well.","Taipei, Taiwan","Thomas K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",117,4.0

The place is a mix between Western (French mainly) and Japanese style. The rooms are spacious, very comfortable and nicely equipped. The food experience was delightful, from the popular chicken curry to the top notch Kobe beef cooked teppanyaki style. The room service was exceptional (service & menue). The hotel is set into a lush garden that includes an old pagoda, terrasses, restaurants and a famous walking path. Great spa and swimming pool; photo studio available for weddings or other celebrations (7-5-3, for example). Some areas are restricted and children are not allowed to come in (the Marquee bar, restricted hours at the pool). There isn't any kids club by the way. All in all it has been a wonderful stay during which we could enjoy the best service I have ever found in a hotel. Two things though could be improved in my opinion. First: the breakfast. One has three choices if I remember correctly, all served at different places: typical japanese style, mixed buffet near the lobby, or ""à la carte"" at the Italian restaurant. We didn't try the japanese one, but we had to eat at the Italian restaurant as the buffet was mainly prepared to satisfy the Chinese guests (lots of Chinese dishes: dumplings, soups etc). The ""à la carte"" breakfast was nice but it turned out to be more or less the same choice everyday. And second: the lack of transparency regarding the room rates. I asked for a late check out (leaving at 5:00PM) and the hotel actually charged me a full night, and at a much higher rate than previous nights. I didn't bother to argue or negotiate but I couldn't see why it turned out to be as such. I believe I should have talked to the original receptionist that had welcomed us upon arrival.

Nothing against the Hilton or similar hotels (we like our comfort), but we didn't want to visit Tokyo (or Kyoto, see my review of hotel there) and stay in hotels similar to what we could stay in in New York, Chicago, LA or almost any large city. Or hotels similar to the ones we had just stayed at in China (a Ritz-Carlton, Wyndham Grande and Regent) The reviews of the Hotel Chinzanso struck a cord and, as it turned out, were very accurate. We were among the few Westerners at the hotel - it's clearly a favorite of well to do Japanese. The entire feel of the hotel is Asian, from the decor, decorations, wood, to art, including featured paintings by a local artist, The park in which the hotel is situated is beautiful, and reinforces the feel that you are truly in Japan, not Cleveland or Manchester or Sydney. That's not to say that the hotel lacks the features of a Western hotel -- it emphatically does. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. There are a couple of restaurants serving Japanese and Western meals, and as expected, service is first rate. We especially enjoyed meeting Andre, who is a gracious ambassador of the hotel directing guess services. He was helpful when we asked about a walk-about neighborhood that wasn't too far away that we would particularly enjoy. He pointed us to a pretty and active section close to where he lives. The hotel, as the reviews suggest, is not near central Tokyo. It's maybe 30 minutes away. But we figured out the subway system (it wasn't hard) and were able to get back to the hotel with no trouble. There is a hill to walk up, and I wouldn't recommend traipsing up it for the handicapped, but my wife and I felt it provided a nice little workout. We were delighted with our choice of the hotel. We've stayed in fabulous hotels from India to Vietnam to Paris, and this is the equal of any, and heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to experience Japan in Japan, not Houston in Japan.

The first time was in 2013 when the hotel was just out of Four Seasons System. There was a rumor that the Four Seasons gave up this hotel since the hotel was aged. When I visited Chinzanso at that time, it did seem a little bit old, but it was by no meant decayed. Instead, it was so elegant and majestic and just like an old time aristocratWhen I visited Chinzanso this July, I found it was still so classic and charming. The managing staffs took a good care of this old pear, and even punishing it brighter.The spacious room with a view of the garden which was already worth the rent I paid. One could hardly find a prime hotel with such a huge and beautiful garden in any metro cities like Tokyo.My package came with free SPA and free breakfast. I always enjoy their swimming pool and spa. The spa has the real Onsen water from Shizuoka, which is rare in Tokyo. Their breakfast was also enjoyable. One did not need to have a meal in a noisy buffet room but tasted fine Japanese or western style gourmet in a quiet dining room.We had a simple soba lunch at the Mucha-an. The meal is delicious, and the price is fair. Last time we had dinner at the yakiniku restaurant Mokushundo. Since I missed that dinner, this time I reserved a table before departing for Tokyo. Regrettably, I had to cancel the reservation since Japanese friends’ inviting for dinner at another place that evening. If you want to experience authenticly traditional Japanese style of elegy, Chinzanso will be your best and maybe the only choice in Tokyo. Next time I visit Tokyo, I will stay here again definitely.椿山莊曾經是明治時代軍事強人山県有朋的宅邸。如果你對明治維新史有興趣就不能錯過這個地方。這是我第二次到椿山莊。第一次是在2013年這家飯店剛退出了四季酒店集團。當時傳聞是因為飯店太老舊了而被四季放棄。不過當時我親身感覺是飯店有點老但絕非是在頹壞中。相反的，它是優雅而堂皇，就像個老貴族。今年七月我再度造訪時，我發現它依然是經典且迷人。管理人員悉心維護它，甚至讓這顆明珠更閃亮。寬敞的房間窗景是庭園景色，這個庭園就已值回房費。很難在東京這種大都會中找到一個有如此漂亮廣闊庭園。我買的組合包括免費的SPA 和早餐。我一直很喜歡他們的游泳池和SPA，後者是用來自靜岡的溫泉，這在東京是少有的。早餐非常好。你不需要在吵雜的自餐廳用餐，而是在安靜的餐廳裡享用日式或西式美食。我們在無茶庵吃了簡單的蕎麥麵午餐，味美而價格平實。上次來訪時我們在木春堂吃烤肉，令人懷念，所以這次出發前已訂了位。遺憾的是當天有東京的朋友在別處邀宴，只得取消訂位。如果你想體真正傳統日式的精緻，椿山莊會是你在東京最佳甚至唯一的選擇。下次再來東京，我一定還住在這裡。","Taipei, Taiwan","Thomas K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",117,5.0

The location overall is not very convinient. The hotel is approximately 5-7 minutes in foot from the nearest subway station, but there's absolutely nothing interesting nearby, as it is a quiet residential area aside from the main attractions of Tokyo. The hotel has a belle epoche flare, but looks as it has never been refurbished since those times. In many aspects the hotel is outdated - not enough electricity plugs, and those available are hard to find and partly not working; old-fashioned design. Currently there is some refurbishment ongoing, so I hope they will rennovate it. The hotel garden is large and lovely and there are a lot of fireflies which can be observed in the evening. There's even a firefly cave under a small waterfall where you can see the fireflies very close. The hotel manager is very nice and polite, but the staff is not always working efficiently, though they tried hard. The check-in was very long and messy, there was some misunderstanding with deposits and client's credit cards, and not everyone of the staff understood English well enough. The suitcases were delivered to the rooms with big delays. The room was quite large and comfortable, and of course very clean. Almost all the rooms have garden views. There are L'Occitane amenities in the bathroom. Breakfasts were fine, but again - staff served everything very slowly, those who were in a hurry to the conference, needed to ask for the coffee several times. This hotel could be a nice conference venue, as it has a large business center and a lot of conference facilities, but they need serious modernization and design upgrade.","Moscow, Russia","Mariaquerida</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moscow, Russia</strong>",44,3.0

I hope that gives you an idea of the height of class of the hotel!We arrived via taxi from the Mejiro station, just a 5 minute drive, probably the best option with our large luggage. Easy to get a taxi outside the station. The rest of the time we walked to the Edogawabashi station to get around town with our Suica card! It is about a 8-10 minute walk from the hotel entrance, or through the gardens of the hotel. Not much difference. Wouldn't advise the garden path late at night though, it was rather dark. Also the hotel garden gate closes at about 9pm I think. Well, no doubt the hotel is beautiful with lots of greenery. Many many Japanese couples have their wedding there, so beware during the weekends, you will probably bump into at least 2-3 wedding celebrations! Interesting to see, but I wouldn't have wanted to disturb them. Hint: don't walk through the gardens to get out on the weekends, you'd be intruding into crowds of wedding guests and photographers, at least during wedding season. The hotel is very clean and the rooms large and spacious. We didn't take breakfast there, but had dinner at the soba restaurant which was very pretty and tasty. Walking through the hotel and grounds transports you back to traditional Japan which is beautiful and luxurious, but almost uncomfortable for us, we (or at least I) felt that I was destroying the ambience of the hotel just by being there! Most of the people in the hotel were also dressed to the nines (for real). However, all the staff were very polite and kind, lending us umbrellas for rainy days and pointing us in the right direction for the trains, although I'm not sure how many hotel guests actually used the trains instead of taxis. The staff also speak English perfectly, so not to worry about language. Make sure you grab a map of the grounds and spend a few minutes walking through the hotel gardens with a camera! If you want an experience of Ultimate Japanese Luxury, in my opinion, this is the place to stay! This hotel has a shared shuttle to the airport and quite a cheap rate, and the bus is big and spacious. In typical Japanese timeliness, they overestimate the journey time by quite a bit, so you will most definitely be on time to catch your flight!

The service of reception has deteriorated a lot. The young receptionist did not check our passports and kept saying that the booking was for one room instead of two rooms. He did not listen to me and asked me to sign a check-in form with an Indian name on it. I told him that the form was not for me. He realised his mistakes. The first thing for a hotel receptionist is to identify the guest and the guy obviously skipped the process. The worst thing was that we could not get any lunch at the hotel which has nine restaurants. Why ? All the restaurants were fully booked by non-hotel guests. The restaurant receptionists simply told us to go away instead of offering waiting lists. The guest rooms are very nice as usual and the pool is absolutely fantastic.

Also to be noted, the nearest train station is about ten minutes walk away.

After completing the registration process, you then take a seat again and wait for the bellhop to come and load your luggage.

And the reason is that this was by far the best hotel experience that I have had. We (2 adults, 2 kids) spent 6 nights in Chinzanso in our two week holiday in Japan. We had the standard room with cityview. Room was large enough for our family and the view was stunning especially at nights. The bathroom was spacious and the separate bath and shower closet is always a big plus and a minimun that good hotel should have. Btw the shower closet was large enough for two adults (good for parents having their kids in the same hotelroom) The nearest stations were Mejiro (JR, very good one for Japan rail pass owners) and Edogawabashi (sub). They are not quite close but the taxi to Mejiro cost about 900 yenis, so about 9 euros. Of course you can also use the bus which stop is next to hotel. At evenings, the kids were quite tired for travelling around Tokyo so we tried also the restaurants in Chinzanso. We had dinners in japanese style restaurants Mucha-an, Mokushundo and Miyuki because we wanted to eat japanese food. Restaurants in hotels are sometimes a risk (except Michelin star restaurants in some hotels), but this time there were no risk at all. We all liked the food in all of those restaurants very much. The experience of authenticity was actually better than most of the restaurants that we had dinners in our travel.We tried also the Afternoon Tea set in Le Jardin. No complaints. And I have to mention the Chinzansos garden which is extraordinary and special for the hotel in the middle of Tokyo. I have spent many nights in 5-star hotels around the Europe and USA.

The hotel is very plush but it never overwhelmes the guest. All service staff are unfailingly polite and helpful and the service levels are probably the best that I've ever experienced. The hotel is a couple of hundred metres uphill from the Edogawabashi station and it was pleasant to walk up and down the hill in March. The concierge staff speak excellent English (very helpful for the non-Japanese). We took advantage of the luggage transfer service to our next hotel in Kyoto and concierge staff took care of it in a jiffy.F&B quality is very good. The hotel bar is very nice though we would recommend avoiding the finger food and stick to the drinks. The bar has a very good selection of whiskeys. We would also recommend the Sakura flavoured drinks in Cherry Blossom season. We ate in the Japanese restaurant and the food with sake pairing was excellent. Service staff were a bit harried as the restaurant was quite full but we didn't experience inordinate delays. The breakfast service is the only let-down in this hotel. There are two breakfast options. A set menu in the restaurant or a traditional buffet breakfast in the lobby. The buffet has rather limited choice without a live egg-station. This is something that the hotel management needs to look into.The loveliest part of this hotel has to be the garden. We specifically asked for a garden view room after reading the other reviews and it is a sight to behold. We went in spring and the spring colours were just coming out in their full glory. The silence in the garden is something to be experienced. The harmony of water, plants and structures in the garden is very soothing. We spent a couple of hours in the garden just soaking it all in.

I had very high expectations after all the glowing reviews, and this hotel did not disappoint. We were thoroughly impressed about absolutely everything! Prior to Arrival:Their highly efficient concierge team arranged for our round trip airport transfer, and secured a dinner reservation at Mokushundo. They replied to all my e-mails very promptly. Everything went smoothly, even with our 2-hr flight delay.Arrival:We arrived after 9pm. Hotel driveway entrance is brightly lit up, and the beautiful lobby is tastefully decorated for Christmas. Excellent guest services all-around. Reception was very warm and welcoming, and we had 2 bellhops for luggage assistance.Six-night stay:My family of 4 (hubby and 2 girls, ages 12 and 6), stayed for 6 nights, so we were able to avail of their extended stay rate. We were given a renovated room on the 11th floor in the Hotel wing, with an amazing city view. It was very beautiful and spacious, with a gorgeous bathroom that boasted a separate bathtub and shower, toilet, and L'Occitane products throughout.They don't make you wait here. Housekeeping was very speedy with special requests... and our room was always spotless. Room service, which we used 3x for breakfast, is quite impressive. They are thorough, and fast. We also had a very pleasant experience at Miyuki, where we had breakfast 2x. Their concierge team is the best. They're on top of everything. There is a meticulous attention to detail. Amazing.The extensive spa facilities are free for 2 persons per day, and I was able to enjoy this with my 6-yr old daughter. The pool is warm, and massive...and we enjoyed everything, especially the jaccuzzi. Consistently excellent service, wherever we went.Getting AroundSo many options. We were on buses (bus stop is in front of the Tower wing), and we used all train stations in the area. Tokyo's transportation system is highly reliable --- all you need is a pasmo or suica card, and the right app to figure out your route to get around. You can use cash at the bus, too, if your card runs out of charge. We only used the taxi on our last day, when we were in a hurry to go to Sunshine City (2 miles away) for last minute shopping, and lunch. Hotel GroundsBreathtaking. I almost cried at the sight of the garden. You just have to see for yourself.DepartureAirport limousine bus was on time, and luggage assistance staff were so efficient. The drive was very pleasant, with no problems. Arrived at the airport 20 mins earlier than scheduled, which was great, as Narita has so many shops! In ConclusionWe did not want to leave. Tokyo is a beautiful city, which offers a feast for the senses. This hotel is an oasis of serenity. World-class service. 5-stars all the way. This was our first time in Tokyo, and I hope it won't be the last. We will definitely stay at Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo again.

A seasoned five star guest will no doubt have some gripes because when you are at this level minor things can create a stiff black mark, but for me, I was more than impressed by the service and attentiveness of staff. I usually go for four star design hotels with sprinkles of five-star, so Chinzanso was a little different to what I typically sign up for. What attracted me were the grounds and garden which are truly a reason to stay in itself as well as the pool and spa area. And just staying somewhere that's so overtly opulent with such a cultural feel as an experience. The hotel itself looks opulent - it's grand with marble and long staircases. It really is quite a beautiful setting. The room was large, even by western standards and the bathroom was probably one of the best I've ever stayed in and comparable to upper end Vegas hotels in terms of space and functionality. Separated shower, separated toilet, bath and enormous vanity with it's own TV. We likely got this hotel on a cheap rate because everything was extra. I didn't think I should have to spend another 4000 odd yen to access the Yu Spa, but spas are my thing so I did it and it was worth it, but again, once you're in there food and drinks are another extra on top. I'm not entirely certain but I think that the spa fee covers you for two days. Pool area is fantastic, has a large spa, steam room, dry room and a hot spring. I definitely felt relaxed. We went in firefly season and they cultivate them for this which can be viewed on the bridge of the garden. I had no idea what fireflies looked like and was expecting a light show going off the promotion. They are small, slow moving bugs that light up beautifully as they fly, but there aren't heaps of them - maybe ten - which is probably normal. The concierge was great and helped me with whatever I needed quickly and easily. Staff saw us right into our room and helped us with our luggage and any questions we had about the grounds.

But there are several glaring, to my mind, exceptions. First, the location, while probably fine for business stays, is terrible for tourists and travelers. A taxi or bus to a nearby train station and then often a train line transfer is necessary to get most anywhere touristically interesting. It's just so far from any tourist sight.Second, the restaurant food is significantly below standard. The three lobby floor restaurants have sparse menus and even though they say they are Italian or whatever...the food is with a Japanese twist. This was not acceptable to this reviewer. Plus it is extremely expensive. ¥1800, about $17, for a regular glass of beer is ridiculous. Not everyone is on expense account. My ¥3410 ($31) breakfast brought juice, coffee and three breads, ok so far. But the two scrambled eggs were significantly undercooked and watery. The two slices of bacon were incinerated and basically inedible. Reporting of displeasure (and a firm suggestion the executive chef go into the kitchen and check the abilities of the line cooks) was met with a shrug and not even an apology.A chicken Caesar salad (around $20+) was dry, with poorly cut lettuce, excessive parmesan slices and chicken which was dry and appeared to be sliced off a processed roll, like lunch meat often used for sandwiches. It was certainly not worth the price but moreover, it was completely at odds with the quality image of this hotel. With under two dozen items on the whole menu, they should be able to make a salad right.The worst sin, however, is they serve shark's fin in at least one of the restaurants. This should lower my rating even further but I'm feeling benevolent at the moment.With all the fine hotels in Tokyo, one shouldn't have to be confined in isolation with limited food choices.","Ocala, Florida","Kairho1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ocala, Florida</strong>",353,3.0

On one day in particular, they had ordered a taxi to take me to the office. But it was taking too long so I went to jump into a random taxi as it pulled up. Before I could even shut the taxi door, staff had printed out directions to the office and handed it to the taxi driving informing him of where I needed to go. They gave me a bottle of water because it was a hot day too!I stayed in a superior king room which was exceptionally spacious for a ""standard"" room. The bathroom was very spacious and nice too. I didn't eat often in the hotel restaurants, but for the few nights that I did the food was very good. The location turned out to be ok as it was not far from the office, but sometimes challenging to get to other destinations if I was going to travel by train (I had not been to Japan before, so the whole train thing was a little confusing). There is a local subway (Edogawabashi) around a 7 minute walk from the hotel which was handy. There are a few shops and things around there, but not much. The nearest shopping & restaurant centre I found on the subway line was Sunshine City/ Ikebukudo, which is only 2 stops away. The Chinzanso gardens are nice but not particularly big. You can spend maybe 30 minutes in there and see everything. The Mokushundo restaurant (old-style dishes cooked on hot lava rocks) in the garden looked amazing but unfortunately I was not able to dine there. I am torn between giving this hotel a 4 to 5 star review. It's really only the location that brings it down a little bit for me. But if the location suits you, then it really is a fabulous choice.","Sydney, NSW","The_Logocracy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, NSW</strong>",36,5.0

The gardens and outdoor jacuzzi were the main reason I would recommend it. I would suggest allowing at least one entire day just to stay at the hotel, walk through the gardens and enjoy the facilities. It would be a shame to stay at Chinzanso and not have enough time to appreciate it's beautiful grounds! It really feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Our twin room was comfortable and very spacious, much bigger than most hotel rooms in Japan. The decor in my room was antique, french provincial inspired, but it did feel a little dated, especially the floral curtains. The bathroom was large, with a big bath and shower, lots of marble and really great amenities. The L’Occitane toiletries were a nice touch. The gardens are the star of the Chinzanso! They are enormous and there are many different areas, with bridges, ponds, fish, a pagoda, a shrine, gorgeous ancient stone statues, and endless varieties of trees and flowers including some beautiful cherry blossoms and maples. It’s a garden lovers paradise! And it’s incredibly photogenic, I couldn’t help but think it would be the most picturesque hotel in Tokyo for a wedding!The indoor swimming pool is large and naturally lit which is nice. The gym was decent sized and well equipped. The best facility by far though, was the outdoor jacuzzi. It’s a stunning shallow hot pool built in natural stone surrounded by weeping maple trees! It’s the most picture perfect little spa I’ve ever seen, especially on a cold day when you can see the steam floating above the water. I would return to the Chinzanso just to spend another hour in that jacuzzi!I didn’t eat at the restaurants, however the a la carte breakfast which was included in my room was very good. It was in a nice little breakfast room with fresh flowers and it felt very upmarket. I had the American breakfast with coffee and juice and it was tasty and served quickly. Overall, my stay at the Chinzanso was enjoyable. I wasn’t blown away by the room, but the service was pleasant and the gardens were stunning. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the outdoors and appreciates horticulture. The Hotel Chinzanso is centrally located, but if you are arriving with luggage, you must take a taxi as it’s too far to walk to the train station.","London, United Kingdom","CuriousSophia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",64,4.0

While there are plenty of luxury hotels in Tokyo, this one, for the exceptional beauty of its garden and the taste of its decor and facilities, must rank as one of the best. It's fundamentally a wedding venue (it started off that way in a previous and perhaps even ancient avatar) so expect every corner of every part to be photogenic, and service to be charming, discrete and polished to the highest degree with polyglot European as well as Japanese staff. It is in other words a pampering hotel - the kind that every evening hand writes the weather forecast for you and leaves chocolates after the turn-down service, and sometimes has a harpist or pianist in one of the public areas. If you treat it only as a business hoel (which we saw it was used as too) it's a waste. We used three of its restaurants and they ranged from the very good to the terrific - not cheap but not outrageous either. We also had martinis on the bar - they offer around 100 variations, including the ""Camelia"", which is laced with gold dust. We didn't use or even visit the spa facilities but I'm confident that if we had they would have been up to par with the rest. There is a charming lounge on the 12th floor with a great view of the gardens that guests can enjoy during the day. It has free coffee and tea (these are also provided in the very well appointed rooms - the hotel even has its own mineral water which provides freely for guests in the rooms). The one downside is that it is a little off the beaten track -the nearest underground is Edogawabashi, a relaxed 10 minute walk away through the gardens and along the cherry-tree lined canal path. It's 30 minutes walk through the back streets from the small but fabulous shopping and restaurant area of Kagurazaka. If you want a hotel that pampers and helps you to relax in the megalopolis, this is it. We'll certainly be back.","London, United Kingdom","andrewking2904</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

Come on Tripadvisor, give us more flexibility!The Chinzanso is the height of restrained elegance. It is a reminder of the 'grand' hotels of the past, with a truly wonderful garden, and some very elegant dining options. Although well maintained, the hotel is starting (only just starting) to show signs of wear and tear. What it isn't, though, is up-to-the-minute. It doesn't have the wow factor of some more modern properties, but then I don't think it's aiming to. That isn't to say that it's old - the building is relatively new (I would guess built in the 80s) and very nice. But it is designed to be elegant (that word again), not modern.I think that the hotel could probably benefit from having at least one less formal eating/drinking option, even their ""casual dining"" is somewhat non-casual!If you're looking for the excitement, bustle and chaos that Tokyo can offer then this isn't for you.

As I understand the Four Seasons franchise is gone, so now it is only Chinzanso. The hotel is very nice, but it has something old in it, I can't say what exactly, but it seems to be behind the curve. Compared to other luxury hotels it seems to me this hotel remains behind its peers. Now I don't want to be critical - the hotel was super-clean, the staff very friendly and helpful. But the room seemed to be the room of a luxury hotel from the 1970s. I don't know what exactly gave me that impression, the atmosphere, the lack of decorations maybe. And yes, management is getting sloppy a bit. On the desk there was a paper from management apologizing for some repairs which could make noise during the month of October. And I was staying there at the end of November:) Apart from these little points, what I did not like was the breakfast. The food quality was good, but the lady who would get my breakfast ticket and show me to my table had an unpleasant attitude - almost like a school staff taking pupils to the table. No welcoming, no smiles, no politeness, just down to business, made me feel like I was about to be fed. Plus I had to wait for a table to become available, for about 5 minutes. It's not long I know, but I just don't see a luxury hotel where you wait for your table at breakfast. This is a first timer for me to be honest.

Le Marquis bar - LAST ORDER 12am, but if you are still drinking at 2am they don't go anywhere without complaint! I asked a bartender how did they get home if they stayed late - he said that they didn't - there is a small room in the back where they can stay the night... I had a 2 yr break between visits - remembered exactly what newspapers to bring in the morning per my prior request. Things that you don't see: once I returned to my room while it was being cleaned. Wow! Two maids in tandem with a stern supervisor with a check list, the bed moved and the mattress lifted, so that they can clean every square inch thoroughly. Have you looked under any bed in a hotel recently? Gross. Not here. The pool and the spa? Spotless. The sauna and the onsen have been the same for years..., yet so well maintained as if brand new. Well-oiled machine throughout the hotel and people who not only try to satisfy the customer, but take a big pride in their work. Then the setting, one of the most beautiful gardens in Tokyo, make sure to get the garden view room (even if paying extra). Some folks feel it's a bit out of the way, but I found the location convenient and easily accessible via subway (Yurakucho line Edogawabashi station) and JR (from Meguro station via 5min taxi ride). Finally, for $250-300 the price cannot be beat! Insider info: ask for business packages available - free breakfast, spa and 1 taxi ride within Central Tokyo (Yamanote line). Per review title, I've spent quite some time in this hotel and can almost write a book about it, but I'll leave it for another time...","New York City, New York","Chimata-no-kami</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",111,5.0

No need to worry here at the Chinzanso - if you feel like staying in something of a haven from the bright lights and crowds of central Tokyo, you will find it here. Set in an enchanting garden with a variety of trees, a carp filled lake, a waterfall, small shrines in abundance - even a hill - it is delightful. Not only is the hotel extremely efficiently managed, the staff are all smiling, quick and very helpful and the rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable, the bathrooms excellent and the room service delivered with discretion. And Wifi was rapid and free! We were very happy during our six nights spent here and wouldn't hesitate to return. I was on my own much of the time since my husband was attending a conference which, I have to say, made no impact on we ordinary mortals in the hotel which was something of a relief. The concierge happily found me a wonderful English speaking guide who touted me around the main sights - she introduced me to the joys of the Metro system but when I wasn't with her, I tended to use cabs which is very easy. There is not much to see in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but there is a very pleasant walk by the river through the residential area of Bunkyo and the magnificent modern Roman Catholic cathedral of St Mary, just by the hotel entrance, is a must.

It is the atmosphere of the reception, the serenity of the garden, the sincerity of the staff and various little things that impress visitors, and these are not convey-able through photographs.We arrived before check-in time and were greeted at the door by someone holding a list with our names on it. There were no tourist groups in the lobby, nobody hanging around aimlessly, no queues at the check-in counter - just a very warm and welcoming reception as if it was not our first visit!

It was a leisurely downhill walk through a tree-lined residential area. One could see the state of those little houses, no doubt a pride of their owners/residents. Along the way we saw a neighbourhood bakery and a few convenience stores. Depending on where one wishes to explore, the station is between 2-5 stops from the main shopping areas of Tokyo Station or Shinjuku. If taking a taxi is what one prefers, the fare is about 3500 Yen to Tokyo Station and 2000 or so to Shinjuku, traffic permitting.The room itself was faultless (we didn't smell any cigarette smoke as some people have commented). Little fine touches were noticeable throughout in the decoration, and in the provision of necessities to make us feel special and valued.The washroom itself was top-notched in its decoration and facilities with brand name Occitane and Intellige Ex skin care products for the ladies and house brand shaving cream for the gents!Breakfast was either Japanese or Continental, consumed at two different restaurants. We were delighted and not surprised to find that it was not of the buffet variety.

So late in the evening and very tired I had to go down to checkin again, and ask for a non-smoking room, as my assistant had clearly requested when booking.The rooms are quite large for Tokyo standards, clean, and -as mentioned- not of the modern but conservative design.Breakfast was good, service a bit slow though. I had also a dinner in the teppanyaki restaurant in the park (forgot the name) which was really good, as well as in the restaurant ""The Bistro"" which served an excellent Wagyu steak. The hotel bar is OK, but not great: first of all, you need to be able to tolerate loud Australian tourists and really LOTS of cigar and cigarette smoke.

To get anywhere, we walked 10 minutes down the hill to the subway station and to small restaurants and shops including a Seven Eleven whose ATM works with non Japanese credit cards. Another time, we took the free hotel shuttle bus to a large square with lots of department stores and another subway line. Many weddings took place while we were there, always a lovely sight with the beautiful dresses.At the end of our tour, we had a farewell dinner in one of the tearooms in the garden which turned out the best traditional Japanese dinner we had on the entire tour.

Access from Narita takes a couple of hours from landing. We took the Skyliner bound for Ueno, changed to the J.R. Yamanote line at the Nippori stop. We took the train to the Meijiro stop. A quick walk across the street to the bus stop for Bus 61. 10 minute bus ride to Chinzanso stop and you're here. The grounds are lovely. The staff are top notch, typical Japanese hospitality but even more pronounced, commensurate with the class of the hotel. The hotel offers breakfast vouchers for either Il Teatro for western style breakfast or Mizuno for Japanese style breakfast. The voucher is for ¥3100 and you can select from set menus. We chose the western style breakfast and it was just okay. We also ordered room service our first night in. Aside from being overpriced (like all room service), it was fine. They have a great variety. The bathrooms are lovely. Private toilet area, deep tub, and a spacious standing shower stall.The gardens are unbelievable. So peaceful and beautiful. The staff is outstanding. We traveled with our one-year-old twins. They have a long list of convenience items for babies and are happy to provide them. We called the desk and asked for diapers as we hadn't had the chance to get to the drugstore. A staff member was at our door in less than 3 minutes with a selection of diapers. They're so helpful.This has been such a relaxing experience. We will certainly be back. I would definitely recommend this hotel to families, especially those with babies.

Our bags were taken away from us at the door, we were shown to a seat while they sorted out check in, and then we were taken up to our room on the 12 floor. A flawless welcome! The Japanese people take a pride in what they do, which makes it a pleasure to visit their lovely country, and they do not act that way because they want you to tip them either! If only it was like that back in the UK or US! When we arrived we were not told about the hotel facilities, so we wandered around later that day and found a small room on our floor called the Pagoda Lounge with coffee making facilities and a range of teas available, but for some reason the room was only open until 6pm. I think management should review this as it would have been nice for guests to have been allowed to sit in there in the evening and watch the night descend on Tokyo. Throughout our stay the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. They bow when you walk past, which seems really strange when you first encounter it, but this was not our first trip to Japan and we appreciated their courtesy and respect. They all speak some English, but most, not brilliantly. The only reason why I have given this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is the breakfast We paid in advance 3,000 yen per breakfast and you receive a set of vouchers that you must take down to breakfast with you. If you only want some toast, pastries and coffee, don't pay in advance as the tokens cost more than the cost of the continental breakfast.On our first morning we were given a menu and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon. There was also a bread basket on the table with lightly cooked toast, a croissant, a couple of pastries and two muffins. That day in particular, service was very slow. Eventually the scrambled egg arrived with a salad swimming in dressing and American style crispy cooked bacon. I'm sorry, but I just did not like the breakfast. For one thing I do not want a dressed salad for breakfast, and we found that every breakfast you order has the salad. Why do they do that? The scrambled eggs looked like vomit on a plate, I only wish I had taken a picture of it so you could see what I mean. It just looked awful, hardly cooked and very runny. That morning I just ate the crisp bacon and the toast, and left the rest. From that point on I ordered the continental breakfast, which is orange juice, tea / coffee and the breadbasket, which for 1,800 yen must be the most expensive toast in the world. On day 4 my husband tried the Japanese breakfast. Now that was worth eating, so do try it. One person I do want to mention was a female waitress who served us. She made sure that our toast was properly cooked when I asked for it to be well toasted and warm, and she was very attentive in other ways too. The name on her badge was A Wright and I asked to be sat each morning in her area. I have been critical up to now, and I feel bad doing it, because [ I really enjoyed my stay at the Chinzanso. Yes, we paid a lot for cabs because the hotel is a little way out, but reviews on here had warned us about that, so we expected to do this, and there was no problem in finding our way around. As for the facilities, they are what you would expect in a hotel of this size. The rooms were large and comfortable, the bed was good, and the air conditioning was the quietest I have ever known in a hotel. The bathroom has a bath and separate shower, which I was delighted to find as I cannot manage to step into a bath whenever I want a shower. Typically a Japanese person will wash in the shower and then relax in the bath, so it is not unusual to find this in a Japanese hotel. It also has the usual Toto toilet, which is has all sorts of extras not found in a European toilet.Other reviewers have mentioned that they did not receive the toiletries they required, but we found the supplies were plentiful, and our room was well cared for by the cleaning staff who left the room spotless, even to the point of tidying up our work papers, which we had just thrown down on a chair. Twice a day they left a Japanese newspaper hanging in a bag outside our door. There were English newspapers in the breakfast room which you could take away with you. There is a kettle in the room, which was useful too, and the inevitable bar / refrigerator, but they give you a complimentary bottle of water every evening when they turn down the beds. Our room had a lovely angular window that looked right over Tokyo and the curtains were opened using a switch found in the top drawer of the bedside table. We used room service on the day we arrived, and the food arrived quickly on one of those cabinets that convert into a table. Again no tip was expected. I hate going to hotels where you have to tip staff if they smile at you, we stayed recently at a hotel in Washington that was like that and it was really annoying, and expensive! In contrast, the Chinzanso was so relaxing, the staff were approachable and I didn't have to think all the time: ""do I tip this person, or not"".This is a large hotel, with a beautiful garden as others have mentioned, and there is a deck which also is laid out as a garden on the 5th floor. We might have made more use of the facilities had we been told in advance what they were. I got totally lost on the second day when trying to find the garden, there were no signs to the door. A friend who lives in Tokyo warned us that they had cases of dengue fever which is spread by mosquitos, so it was good to see some bottles of mosquito repellent on the 5th floor and by the front door. That was very considerate of them.This is a hotel that has to be wandered around. We found a bar, but it was smoky so we did not stay too long. In the UK we do not have smoking in public places, and that suits us fine. There were various restaurants, some shops, a pool that we did not use, and wifi worked well, and was free too. It really annoys me when you pay a lot for a hotel room, and then they expect you to pay for wifi, and there are hotel chains I do not use because of that. Apart from breakfast, this place and its staff was faultless. On our last morning we had to leave early, and it looked like we were going to miss breakfast, however they prepared for us a take out bag and could not have been more helpful in organising our bags and loaded them on a shuttle for us. I have stayed in other hotels in Tokyo and Kyoto and the service is always good, and you can expect the rooms to be clean and tidy, but there was something special about this hotel. You felt that the staff did that little bit extra to help you. A couple of things to add, across the road is a lovely church and next door is a garden centre with a little cafe and a museum. Do not miss the museum, which is only small, but it has some great paintings in there. The hotel is in two parts, and the bus stops next door so if you want to use the bus, you do not need to go outside the grounds. Cabs are plentiful, and are always outside the front door. When we first turned on the TV there is some advice about what to do in an earthquake. Watch it. While we were there we experienced an earthquake; the ground shook for a bit and then stopped, so it is worth knowing what to do in the hotel, just in case.",Essex,"happyessextraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Essex</strong>",68,4.0

Before checking in, we decided to have lunch at Le Jardin. Unfortunately, the restaurant does not cater to those with dietary restrictions. There were no vegan options available so I was unable to eat. This is understandable at a 2 or 3 star hotel, but completely unacceptable at a hotel that describes themselves as ""Luxury Hotel Tokyo, 5 Star"". I expect a much higher level of service at a hotel of this class. Clearly, their rating needs to be changed. The hotel features the ""Pagoda Lounge"" which is a lounge area with free coffee, tea, and reading materials. I spent some time here on my first day relaxing and viewing the garden. On my second day, I returned at opening time to find it closed without any sign or notice. After a 20 minute wait, we were informed by the staff that it was moved to a lower floor. Unbelievable. Again, not the kind of serve I expect at a ""5 Star"" hotel. Other than the problems above, the room was spacious, and had a great view of the garden. The furniture and design though, are a bit dated and dirty. As for the location, it is a bit inconvenient for tourists, especially those who are unfamiliar with the transportation system in Tokyo. I understand this used to be a Four Seasons property. What a big change, this place is nowhere near the level of service a Four Season Hotel provides. I hope the hotel changes their ""5 Star"" rating and if not, then at least live up to the standards of service.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but we received a straight forward drop off to the hotel from Narita Airport via the Airport Limousine bus service. It is a lovely hotel and we had requested two interconnecting rooms for our two children and ourselves. The rooms I would have to say were the largest I've seen in Japan and they were beautifully appointed. Some may say they are a little outdated, but I found them to have all the mod con's required and comfort was definitely the focus. My only issue were the pillows - I requested a foam pillow and was delivered the biggest heaviest rice pillow I have ever seen and it was almost too heavy to lift let alone sleep on, so I reverted back to the down pillow. The bar was a great place to have a few drinks after dinner and the breakfast room provided a great al a carte option. We didn't have dinner there as it was incredibly expensive and so we found a local pub to experience the local cuisine. Although the location of the hotel is a little way out, as a result its incredibly quiet and peaceful for sleeping and the garden and pool was of a great size compared to other hotels closer into the CBD. However it was easily accessible to the trains (5 min walk) so that was not a deterrent at all. The hotel were also kind enough to provide us with a transit to Tokyo Station upon our departure as we were on our way to the snow and knew we wouldn't be able to fit into the cab with all our luggage.

The rooms are beautifully appointed in a traditional style. Our room was particularly spacious with a large bathroom with bath and separate shower and separate WC. The real test however is a hotel's response to a problem. We had a hiccup with our first breakfast, which engendered a complaint. The Hotel's response was immediate and complete.As an aside, i note earlier comments as to locality, being problematic. My view differs to the extent that there is bus 61 which stops outside the hotel. it runs every five minutes and terminates at Shinjuku Station in the centre of the metropolis. It is an easy 10 minute pleasant walk to the underground and a 25 minute walk to the JR station at Mejiro. Not a problem!",Sydney,"orgia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",50,5.0

We managed to get a very good rate at the lastminute (40% off) which made it really good value, especially as they accommodated our two young kids in the same room. The main drawbacks are that it is not that convenient for getting around town as you have to take a cab to the nearest station (about US$10) and the food and beverage is seriously expensive (for example a draft beer in the bar is 15 bucks). However, in my view the inconvenience is made up for by the tranquility of the setting and if you are sightseeing in Tokyo its actually really nice to have the contrast by coming back here in the evening.

My wife and I were engaged during our stay 9 years ago. The hotel was rebranded Chinsanzo Hotel in 2013. We thought the excellent service we came to love would continue, and decided to stay here. It was not so. We were left sorely disappointed. The disappointment started upon arrival. No bell staff to take our luggage. I had to go to the concierge to get trolley and help. Next come all the hidden charges. Want a garden view? USD30 a night - no more complimentary upgrades. More ridiculous is the charge of USD42 a person a night for the use of the swimming pool. Which five+ star hotel does that? Complimentary taxi to the train or subway station? Gone. The concierge used to help get Disneyland tickets with no charge - no longer. The hotel remains the same cleanliness, but you can see subtle cost cuts and compromises. Example: The stationary at the desk were of lower grade. Even the smiles and calling you by name are now less frequent. You just feel that the perfectionist Four Seasons quality is gone.Shame.

The room itself is also very nicely furnished, with a large bedroom, and huge marbled bathroom by Japanese hotel standard.

The other drawback is the location is not convenient to using public transport, esp JR, since the closest metro station Edogawabashi is about 15 mins walk.

Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo is set on a hillside that was called Camelia Hill until 1878 when prince Aritomo Yamagata purchased it and named it Chinzanso. The gardens that he and later owners established are there for all to see and enjoy, not just hotel guests. This is one of the nicest gardens attached to a hotel that I have ever seen! The camellias and cherry trees were in full bloom for our visit. The rest of the garden sights like the three story pagoda that is around 500-600 years old, are worth noting too. The garden lists the “Ten Scenic Spots at Chinzanso” that are all worth seeing. I loved the little statues found along the garden path that I called “Japanese garden gnomes”. The sacred tree of the garden is about 500 years old and stands magnificently towards the bottom end of the garden close to the soba restaurant. They also have a stone lantern from around the 12th century. As if the garden isn’t enough of a reason to stay at Chinzanso we found the room, restaurants, and staff to be excellent. Our room was large by Japanese standards, and in excellent condition. The large bathroom had a tub and separate shower as well as L’Occitane toiletries. We were given room number 1001 which had great views of both the gardens and the city of Tokyo. We found the location of the hotel to be much quieter than any other we had stayed at in Tokyo. I had read in previous reviews online that the hotel is kind of far from restaurants and shopping, but we found that the restaurants in the hotel and nearby were very good and many to choose from. The concierge told us about a nearby 175 year old Unagi restaurant that was Michelin rated and quite good. The train station is a 15 minute walk and the Metro is 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Or you can take a taxi for 710 Yen. The hotel is serviced by the Friendly Airport Limousine bus from Narita Airport, and is a good way to and from the hotel. All in all I can’t think of any other place I could recommend more than this hotel for comfort, and service. We will never forget the service from the concierge desk just hours before we checked out. We had lost our camera two days before, but when we were packing up to leave the room my wife found a taxi reciept from the ride we had taken the day the camera was lost. On a whim we had the concierge call the taxi company to see if the camera had been turned in. It had, but they had sent it to the police lost and found. The concierge called the police, but they couldn’t find it so the concierge called the taxi company back, found the camera and got it to us an hour before we left for the airport. Now that is great service.","Baltimore, Maryland","kjtripper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",183,5.0

From a service perspective, it does not need to be a 4 Seasons. Service is impeccable. I went with my family and while a visit to the garden and the soba restaurant is a must that is a one day activity at most. The hotel is far from the very practical and absolutely necessary train network(closest being Mejiro) and a bus is a bit of a waste of time and a taxi ride is about 800-1000 yen. Restaurant and even breakfast is over priced.",,Toyo3,56,3.0

We arrived via Mejiro JR station and took a taxi which cost JPY980 to the hotel. You could also take a bus for JPY200 from across the road heading right from the entrance of Mejiro station. It is about 10 mins, dropping you across the road from the hotel, along the same road. Check in was swift and efficient and the receptionist who assisted us was very well versed in English. We were escorted and assisted with our luggage to the room and shown the functionality and layout of the room, which was a nice touch. The room was large by Japan standards, about the size of a mid-size room by Australian standards. Unfortunately, it felt that the furnishing and interior designs are beginning to date and carpet within our room was quite worn. Western style bathroom that was also large, with a bath tub and separate shower and toilet. There was a small TV in the bathroom too. Amenities provided was Loccitane and very luxurious to use. Towels, shower pressure and other toiletries were excellent. Turndown service was provided but no bottled water or chocolates like many other hotels would provide, alongside the set up of possibly yukata and/or slippers.There were limited English channels like most hotels in Japan, but the room on the 14th floor with an excellent view of the city, with views to the Tokyo Skytree as well as the Tokyo Tower, which lights up beautifully at night. The complex of the hotel is large, with about 8-10 restaurants which we did not have the opportunity to try. The gardens of the hotel was a highlight, but was not as large and as trimmed as I thought it would be. 30 mins was more than enough to go through the gardens. Lots of wedding does take place there. Concierge was helpful on occasions, on another occasions, I was less impressed because the staff member did not provide the local dining options when asked and said there was almost none, when in fact after I turned over the page of the local map, a whole list was printed on it in English. In addition, when asked about whether all the buses from Mejiro station would stop at the hotel, she said, ""I think so,"" which was unconvincing for a non-local. However, on another occasion, I had another staff member assisted me with booking a bus from Sapporo airport in Hokkaido to my destination there, and everything worked seamlessly, which I was very thankful for. Buses to Mejiro station did not appear to run until about 2pm onwards, which I found inconvenient. On the other hand, it's an easy downhill walk of 350m to the Edogawabashi subway station, and just a little of a good hike back to the hotel on return. Buses arrival and departure time are as reliable as the trains from experience. Overall, our stay was pleasant enough but it would have been much nicer an experience if promotional material, signage including bus timetable to Mejiro station, spa menu, restaurant specials were available more comprehensively in English. The staff overall had an adequate command of English and appears professional, but it would be nice to find the balance between professionalism and warmth as I did not feel the genuine warm Japanese hospitality come across consistently through all staff members, as I have encountered in other hotels in Japan.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Kenny_Cool</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",45,4.0

But if you wanting to duck back for a quick rest or drop off your shopping, it can be an issue due to logistical reasons.Very nice staff, it was a relatively easy check in and check out. An airport shuttle stops right outside the hotel so it's is very convenient.Bathroom was the highlight for me, spacious, clean and the amenities were very nice. The view of Tokyo skyline was amazing too.Definitely will recommend it to others if they don't mind the hike.","Sydney, Australia","Chr15fromSydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",35,4.0

We had been here 5 years earlier, when it was still the Four Seasons; on Jan 1, 2013 it rebranded as the Hotel Chinzanso. This hotel is absolutely luxurious and has a superb staff - and I use that word to compare this hotel's staff to the typically-excellent Japanese hotel staffs. The property is designed to be a luxury experience. Our room was the best we've had anywhere in the entire country during our 8 years of annual or 2x/year travel to Japan. We ate at the hotel's Japanese restaurant one night which was simply superb - the service and food both there quite literally amazed us. We had drinks and desert one evening at the hotel bar and were treated royally. We used the concierge who was excellent, and the baggage staff to both receive our bags several days in advance of our arrival, as well as ship bags to the airport and another city in Japan. All in all, this place is awesome.Don't miss the garden on the property. Its full of historic statues and the 3 story pagoda, collected from around the country by a high-ranking official in the 1800s. One of the statues on the property dates from the mid 1600s! The garden is a serene walk in the center of Tokyo, but sits right outside the hotel. Beautiful and relaxing.The one negative about the hotel is its location: we use the subway and trains almost exclusively when in Tokyo, and this hotel is a good 10 minute walk to the nearest station. And that station is not near anything a tourist would want to do, making the hotel a bit out of the way. But that's a minor tradeoff for the truly excellent value at the rates we've seen online (high-$200USD/night).All in all, we think this place is a steal at the current high-$200s (USD) rates we've seen online. This kind of property/service combo is typically experienced at the $450-$600/night range. We're guessing that they are having to lower the price because its not branded ""Four Seasons"" any longer, but believe me - this place is every bit like the Four Seasons was. If you like to be treated like royalty, enjoy the feeling of being a VIP, and find luxury accommodations up your alley, this hotel should be on your list.","Arlington, Virginia","JB_005</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",4,5.0

However, it's not a very welcoming, cozy place, none of the restaurants or common areas are very appealing for lounging around with a book in. The one exception is the lounge area near the spa, and if you pay for access to the spa/onsen you get complimentary coffee in the mornings in the lounge. The restaurants were very expensive but there are other options near by. Bit out of the centre of things but access is easy by train and bus. It was nice, but I think for the price you pay, you could find somewhere with more convinience or more charm elsewhere.","Chiang Mai, Thailand","RedDirtWanderer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong>",39,2.0
