Only issue i had with the brunch was the fried chicken and waffles, the batter on the chicken was so incredibly hard that when you try to bite or cut the chicken it literally pops off as a shell, i would 100% percent come back and hopefully after covid i can come back to the city.

The hotel is very modern and very well kitted out. Onsite there is a restaurant, bar, gym, 24 hour ice cream vendor and a cool rooftop bar (with a crazy golf course - not to everybody's taste!). The room was fantastic, I really liked the layout in the 'Double Double Room' and the bathroom was really nice and had a rainfall shower. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only negative points I would have is that the breakfast was the same every day - it would have been nice to have some pancakes or other breakfast dishes and maybe some more fruit juice options. Also, the storage space in the rooms is minimal so if you do pack a lot, you will struggle. The location was brilliant, a very short walk from Penn Station and about 1 0 minute walk (if that) to Times Square. Considering how close we were to the main spots in NYC, I always had a great nights sleep and couldn't hear a thing! We were on level 11 and our room had windows that looked out onto a side street.","Warwick, United Kingdom","RebeccaAyris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warwick, United Kingdom</strong>",83,5.0

He was super sweet and polite.

Downs:-Guy at check in didn’t really greet us and just told us to go to the pad. Didn’t really explain anything was just super monotone.-I dropped my phone under the bed and could not get it out (beds are bolted to the floor). Upon looking I found a dirty bra, dirty/lint, and wrapper. I called The help desk and they said they would send someone over but nobody came. I had to go to FD in person to ask for help and which the guy gave me 2 free drinks. Housekeeping didn’t clean the room. All they did was take take the towels I left in a little pile for them. I didn’t get fresh sheets during my stay which blows.-Nobody has a name tag so it makes it hard for me to name the nice people that helped other than Jason. Overall:This place is nice if you plan to be out and about. Close to Penn Station and 42 St making it easy to get to any destination. The bar lounge area is super chill during the day perfect for some light work. During the night it’s nice with good music and the drinks are pretty good.

Expect the room to be small but it's New York and in Times Square so what do you expect really. Beds were very comfy and plenty of plug sockets in the room. Only two problems with the room and hotel it's self was the noise from the street level and we were on floor 14 and the lack of storage. No wardrobes for clothes so you had to live out of our suitcase. The hotel itself it can get quite noisy and lively in and around the lower levels due to the nightclub / rooftop bar. It's quite a young persons hotel (Ages 20-30) so that can lead to extra noise too.

I felt compelled to write based on the amazing service my family received and how special they treated my daughter on her leap day birthday. They recognized the special nature of only having one birthday every four years with several surprises - a cake and balloons, a card signed by the staff, but most impressively, a vinyl album of Alannis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill. My daughter is 20 (it was her fifth birthday) and we were headed to see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway, and the staff took that knowledge and made her day even more special. They even wrote, “Isn’t it IRONIC that your birthday only comes once every four years....” in a play on one of the songs in the album. The staff also sang happy birthday to her when they delivered the cake. She was in awe of how they treated her.There was a special for leap day birthdays that didn’t work for my daughter based on her bringing two friends with her. They still gave her the birthday special with an upgraded room that allowed her to have both friends stay with her. They proactively found a way to get us the special package for her birthday, and we are very grateful. Everything they did was with my daughter in mind. I am 100% sure that they lost money on our stay, but they will make it up in our future stays. They have customers for years to come.

If they could sort this out, it would be great. Prepaid currency cards are very popular nowadays, and I have used them in other hotels without any issues at all. ",,misshmgordon,0,5.0

If you are okay with Housekeeping never happening, friendly but unhelpful staff, enjoy listening to club music in your room - this is the place for you. I would recommend for the young and young at heart who are staying in NYC for a few days and have a very busy schedule and will only spend a few hours to catch up on snooze at the hotel. I knew what I was getting myself into and as a “millennial” had to see for myself what Moxy was like. Plus location is great - everything is walking distance - and compared to the well known brands is about half the price. I did have a few experiences which led me to the conclusion I will most likely never come back or only stay a few nights when I plan to party hard in the city. Experiences that annoyed me -1) hours of housekeeping depends on the day some days they seem to come before noon > so if you plan to snooze until brunch you will not get your room cleaned. other days they don’t come until 3 or 4pm so if you plan an early shopping/ sightseeing day and want a quick nap before hitting the theaters or dinner you will not get your room cleaned. Because of this my room was only cleaned 1 day out of the 7 nights stayed. And the day it was cleaned was because I was gone for over 30hours visiting upstate.> but you can get “clean” towels from the “stash” which is an amenity closet accesible to guests 2) called for help when I dropped my phone between the bed but took one hour for somebody to come.first off why would you create a bed frame that is not completely fitted to the walls if you have sockets on the wall. the space between the wall and bed frame is perfect for your phone slipping but your arm not fitting! every time I called guest service they told me someone was on the way/ will be there shortly/ someone from front desk just headed for my floor. If it is going to take long don’t lie about it. I finally got fed up and used an iron board (from the stash!) and hanger to get my phone out. It was like a disgusting scavenger hunt as I was also able to collect used tissues, someone’s old receipts and the tv remote. I would recommend the hotel to urgently get a mop so housekeeping can clean this space and also leave some in the “stash” so people can use when they drop their phone.3) it’s just so loud!i get it it’s real close to times square but the club music from the rooftop bar is really annoying. but I guess Moxy wants all of their guests up on the roof partying until 3AM. doubling up on curtains at least should help a tad bit. and yes I am aware that they have ear plugs in the “stash”.Overall if you want to feel nostalgic about living in your college dorm I would recommend! I especially enjoyed the exercise I got from carrying a fridge from the “stash” to my room. Took me back to move in day.",,Explorer159261,0,3.0

While my stay was short and I was not able to use all of the restaurants/facilities, I would stay there again and do recommend it. The driver for me leaving a review, happened AFTER my stay. I unfortunately left 2 coats in a drawer in the room while packing to leave too quickly. Initially it was a challenge to get a call back from the hotel when I realized what I had done. Finally, I was able to connect with Security (apparently they deal with these issues) which lead to a dead end and quite frankly gave me the impression that this issue was of little concern to the hotel. I called again and ended up reaching Tammy Diggs who I believe is in accounting and billing. While not her area of responsibility, she was polite, courteous, responsive and solution-oriented. After a quick call, she dug into the matter, and within 3 hours, located the items and sent them on their way back to me. My guess is that people leave things at the hotel all the time. There is a real opportunity for the hotel to train the folks in Security to deal with future issues the way Tammy did. Moxy will have happier customers and most likely build loyalty.

But, for me, the rooms are not great. I am 5ft 6 and the room was as wide as I am tall - I could fit across it on the bed. The rooms have [comfy!] mattresses mounted on a wooden base that elevates them, but since they are not completely flush to the wall and sealed this means that slim items - such as my mobile phone - easily slip down the side and become irretrievable - cue mad scrambling with a stick. There are no wardrobes as the room instead has a wall covered in hooks to hang your clothes on, which - for my fairly long stay in NYC - felt cluttered and messy. I also found it frustrating to have to clamber onto the bed to lean over and open the blind. I should specify that I was aware of the room style before attending since the photographs are accurate, but simply booked in alongside my colleagues on a work trip in the area, for ease. Essentially, if you're travelling solo and are just in town for a few nights its probably fine, but for longer trips or shared rooms I would personally opt for something more traditionally spacious.","London, United Kingdom","JAW503</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

I was going on a cruise and wanted to be there a day or two early. I picked this property because it was relatively close to the port and is a Marriott property. This hotel couldn't have been in a better location. Very close to the Empire State Building, Macy's & tons of other shops. The hotel was very modern and had minimalistic decor, but versatile as well. I was traveling solo, so got the smallest room, which was fine because I wasn't there much anyway. The bed was comfortable and there was not much street noise from my location. The staff was very helpful with any questions I had. I even did a late checkout, as I was feeling ill before I even left for my trip, (ugh). The nice thing about staying here, if you want to go to Magic Hour (which was quite popular), if you are a hotel guest, you tell the front desk, they will escort you to the club entrance, and you DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE!!! It was fabulous being treated like a VIP!!, esp since the line stretched down the block and there is no cover charge for hotel guests either. Even though I wasn't feeling great, I felt I had to enjoy one night out in NYC, so I did Magic Hour at the hotel. Unbeknownst to me, it's a basically millenials, very young crowd, but whatever. There were some patrons over 30 there but definitely the minority. I had good time people watching etc. I figured drinks would be expensive, but was not expecting a $15.00 mojito, YIKES-note to self next time I go back. However, the drink was good, made with Bacardi, and the bartenders were excellent, despite the crowds. Music was OK, but aside from bar stools (and they were full quick), there was no place to sit, as all the booths etc were reserved for TABLE SERVICE ONLY!! God only knows what that costs given the price of the drinks, I asked, but never got a straight answer. Overall, it was very unique and I would certainly stay here again.

Moxy is part of the Marriott Bonvoy hotel chain, therefore, I was able to book my complimentary room using my free annual anniversary night.

I was recognized at Marriott Bonvoy Lifetime Titanium Elite, including complimentary buffet breakfast their Legasea restaurant. The hotel has some of the newer hotel elevators, which take you directly to your room floor by manually entering your room floor and also using my key card. I enjoyed my lunch at the hotel’s Legasea seafood restaurant located in the second floor, where the bar and lobby are also located. See my separate Legasea review.The rooms are very unusual efficient, small and compact in design with pegs on the wall and no furniture except for a folding directors chair and folding table hanging on the pegs. The width of the room is a little larger than the length of the queen size bed. As you can see from my pics our bed was pushed up against the exterior wall with window. The bathroom was also small. The bathroom sink was located in the main bedroom area. This was a unique place to stay for only one night. It was an interesting experience.I walked up to Rockefeller Plaza, St. Patrick’s Cathedral and my restaurant for dinner prior to seeing Hamilton. I used my Marriott Bonvoy app on my iPhone to check out of my room. My hotel bill was accurate.

The room was clean, we had the room with two double beds, and they were very comfortable. The shower did tend to leak into the main bathroom area, however a few towels solved that problem. Just a heads up if you’re sensitive to perfume smells, there is a lot of scents going on in the hotel. Kind of reminded me of Abercrombie and Fitch, like when you walk into the store and all you smell is perfume. It’s not a bad smell, or too overbearing, it’s just apparent throughout every inch of the hotel from room to lobby to elevator, and I know it’s not for everyone.

On this trip, I decided to try something new when I read about the Moxy Hotel. I was not disappointed.The entry is clean, unique and inviting. Love the look. The staff was welcoming, friendly and helpful. I appreciated the secure and efficient elevator/lift call system, and the decor throughout the hotel.I wanted an efficient, clean and comfortable room and they delivered (think “tiny home” efficient). I had a single room with a queen sized bed. The layout is efficient and easy to navigate. The room was clean and organized. Tables and luggage racks were stored/hung from coat pegs all along the wall. You need it, you take it off and use it. You’re done, you hang it. These pegs also made it easy to hang my backpack out of the way and my coat on a large, attached hanger. The large shower with waterfall shower head and the toilet stall shared an efficient area segmented by a single sliding door. Water pressure and heat were great. The sink and related amenities are outside the shower/toilet space, along the side and “in the room.” Loved the simplicity and completeness of the efficiency. Plenty of storage under the bed for clothing and a separate storage for luggage on the lowest floor (which I didn’t need to use but appreciated). The decor in the room reminded me of a combination of a 1920’s tiled pool/bathhouse (replete with “NO DIVING” tiled into the floor of the shower) and a Scandinavian hotel room. Tile, wood, metal. I can’t recall ever having a large flatscreen television in a hotel room that had “window” channels of bubbling brooks, Icelandic landscapes, forests replete with sounds. It was like looking out the window into a different landscape and I didn’t have to have the television on a channel. It served a different purpose.I found the hotel cost to be highly competitive (surprisingly so) in my experience with NYC hotels. It’s location and proximity to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Chelsea, etc. was fantastic. The bar area on the second floor included large comfy chairs and meeting rooms. Again, the decor was unique, interesting and wonderful.This is my new “goto” hotel when I’m traveling on business to this area of NYC. I think I would also choose to stay there when traveling with my family, I just don’t have a sense of the size of the larger rooms but imagine they’d be just fine.",Vermont,"E2001JVgarym</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vermont</strong>",9,5.0

I particularly appreciated the fact that it is only a 3-star hotel but wow, it really went over and beyond what is expected of a 3-star hotel with amazing details and amenities, lots of fun and quirky hotel decor, the Magic Hour rooftop bar was so over-the-top, and the complimentary breakfast and coffee at Egghead was so good. You can't beat the location either! We walked to everything. And when we were jetlagged, we decided to go to Time Square at around 4am because it was so near, and we got to do time square photos with no people but us! With a window view of Empire State Building from our room, and Time Square just literally a few steps away--you just really can't beat that real estate value. And although the rooms are compact, the use of each and every space was ingenious--the shower was incredibly roomy despite the room being compact, and all the leather and black hardware details in the room were super cool.One CON though--the bartender at the 2nd floor should NOT be in the hospitality business. He seemed to hate being there, he was so surly and irritated all the time, and was incredibly unfriendly towards my husband. We are a very quiet Asian couple that just quietly and politely ordered drinks and he scowled at my husband like we did something wrong. To be fair, all the other staff member we encountered, from the front desk to the wait staff at the restaurant, to the doormen at the hotel and bar were all very helpful and nice.

Any question or interaction seemed like a massive imposition on their part and at one point I found myself apologising for asking.+ My card was billed upon check-in without my authorisation nor pre-warning. + I was taken aback as to how small the room was. I don't want for much but there wasn't any space to store / hang clothes, so for four days my clothes stayed in my luggage. + This isn't a hotel; it's a venue. The music from the club (that's open to the public) beats well into the night. Add the restaurant that also open to the public and its serious ""hustle and bustle"". If you're looking for a restful place to crash after a long day in the Big Apple, this is NOT for you.+ The pillows are dreadful: a strange small square that I would more describe as a scatter cushion.

The location is great, we were able to walk everywhere. We stayed in a 2 bunk room and 4 separate beds for 4 people is an oddity that was perfect for our group. They had clearly added additional soundproofing to our room and it was probably one of the quietest hotel rooms I’ve stayed in. Between that and the very effective blackout curtains, we slept like babies! We were in an accessible room so had a bit of extra space, but the room was still rather cave like and I wouldn’t want to spend a lot of time there, but who goes to New York to stay in their hotel room? The bathroom was large and easy to use in a wheelchair without looking clinical. Elevators worked well with a few glitches (not stopping at our floor once even though we got on the right one, leaving before you had time to walk from the touch pad to the elevator, being too crowded to get on). Overall, I think it probably is way more efficient than without the electronic system. DO NOT pay extra for breakfast at this hotel! They had a sign saying “New year, new breakfast” and I’m not sure what they are thinking with the dreadful buffet they are serving. Here is what they had: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and potatoes (not bad, but maybe some cheese & or salsa for the dry eggs?), cold toast (with butter and strawberry jam), bananas, corn flakes, fruit loops, and a big bowl of plain yogurt (nothing to put in it, no honey, no granola, no fruit other than the bananas, who eats plain yogurt without anything in it???) To drink: coffee, tea, and one kind of artificial tasting juice punch thing. No other baked goods, no other fruit option. They ran out of napkins and after a long wait finally came in with paper towels from the bathroom. There was a sign saying they were charging $23 for this. We were given free breakfast for one day because of some problems at checkin and still didn’t think it was worth it. If we had more than one day free, we would not have gone back a second time. There was also confusion about the hours. The first day we tried to eat there we called to check the hours, were told it went until 1030, roused the teenagers, got there about 20 minutes later, at a few minutes after 10 and were told they finish at 10.

They never should have booked this room for 4 people as it was simply 2 full (or less) sized beds pushed together end to end with a narrow walkway to the bathroom. We could not even put out suitcases out and had to leave almost everything packed for our entire 5 day stay. The rooms don’t even make use of smart storage or high shelving etc other than a small box below the bed. The pegs around the perimeter of the room were the most insane solutions for hanging clothing/hats I’ve ever seen. This was all topped off by a narrow sink with little storage space and a “lovely” view of the sad looking gray interior. The only upside was joking & laughing about the rooms with fellow travelers in the bars. We got ready in shifts so made good use of the bars so 1-2 people could actually move around this unbelievable room. If most definitely made me think of a youth hostel in a foreign country.

I love the little touches they had when we visited, such as Prosecco on arrival, daily complementary coffee and every evening they would serve free pink hot chocolate in the lobby! All in all very impressive. However, the rooms are not at all sound proofed. There is a lot of noise from the street (expected) but also from other guests coming back late in the corridors. The room thermostat was set at 20 degrees and when it dropped below in the rooms heater would kick in and it was the noisiest thing ever!!! It would rattle and vibrate loudly every 25 minutes for 5 minutes through the night, keeping us awake. We asked for it to be turned off which the staff obliged with and for a night everything was fine... until they turned it back on (unsure why, we didn’t ask them too) which lead to another sleepless night, this routine happened every other night!! Finally the first couple of times we used the toilet it backed up with sewage water and over flowed, the hotel were very apologetic and sorted it immediately though!!Overall I probably would stay again if the noisey heater would be left off!!

We were in town for a concert and to stroll through the city to fall into the Christmas spirit. Check in was a breeze and we were even provided early check-in without hesitation. The rooms are small but well thought out in terms of space utilization. Those who are complaining in their Trip Advisor reviews about the room size should carefully ready the hotel’s website information which clearly states the rooms are small but the experience BIG. There are plenty of hooks which hold in-room necessities like, a clipboard for writing, a folding table, folding luggage caddy and a small folding table for breakfast in bed or to use your computer in bed. The entire wall span has hooks so in addition to these items, there are plenty left over to hold jackets, purses, etc. Also mounted on the wall right next to the bed is large flat screen TV that is on a swivel arm for viewing while in the room or in bed (genius!).The shower and toilet area is separated from the room by a sliding door with soft closure (brilliant!) and very adequate in size. The rainfall shower head had just the right water pressure and did not drown you like some others. The fixtures and tiles were modern and stylish. The sink is outside of the general bathroom area and was nicely appointed with towels, tissues, soap, etc. There was even a magnified mirror for make up application. Kudos to the designer who has the needs of women guests who require and appreciate this minor luxury in the room.The double bed had a shelf that spanned the length of the bed on one side and included storage compartments and a safe in the under bed area. There were outlets with USB ports (good thinking!) on both sides of the bed which made it convenient for charging multiple devices. The only thing I would add is a small shelf or cell phone caddy on the other side of the bed so that the guest on that side has easy access to their phone without crawling over their partner early in the morning.

Honestly there are way better places to eat in Manhattan. The only nice thing about the hotel is the room. It’s mod and well designed. However there is a vent in your room and you will be cold! Now... let metell you this.. the standard of the housekeeping service is below par, and I question how are the staff trained, as there is a GREAT inconsistency. Your stuff is moved, or taken, or your room isn’t cleaned properly ...With all of this said Marriott need to check up on their moxy- maybe even close it for a bit to address some issues....cause this place has ALOT of work to go.

Upon entering the hotel, I felt a bit nervous at what kind of crowd might be staying there, as it looked like a ""fun"" place. I was worried we would be kept up all night with people partying. Quite the contrary, most of the clientele seemed to be middle aged couples and from our room, we did not hear any noise, except some typical NYC street noises (ie. sirens). The hotel was extremely clean and new looking. Our room was very clean. We had a king suite and it was quite small (but big enough considering we were only using it to sleep in). Apparently, we were given a handicap room and this was supposed to be a bigger room. Didn't love the bathroom. I felt as though I was in a swimming pool change room. Didn't like that there was no door on the shower and that the water from my shower got the rest of the bathroom wet. Our view from the room was into the rooms of other people across the street, but oh well....we just kept our blinds closed. The young lady that checked us in spent a lot of time trying to upgrade our room for us as we had requested (paying for an upgrade). She told us they were at capacity for the weekend but still put forth the effort which we appreciated. We enjoyed Bar Moxy but were disappointed that the food menu was not available on the weekend....we were dying to try the clam chowder. We did have the breakfast 2 mornings with mimosa's and it was very good. Cocktails in the evening were great. Also, if you are staying at the hotel and the food menu isn't being offered, you can bring food in from the outside or order from uber eats and have it delivered, which is kind of cool. The location was definitely the best part. We felt really close to everything and it was so nice to be able to change for dinner and show after a day of walking around (we usually stay at hotels in NYC that are not this convenient and we have to dress for both). Overall, a good stay.","Hamilton, Canada","cat_lover1971</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, Canada</strong>",17,4.0

The Moxy NYC was the worst part of my trip to NYC last week and it's really hard to choose just one reason why. The top contenders are:- The lukewarm shower, it was as cold as you would be after climbing out a hot shower in winter. The water temp and pressure did just not improve. - The middle interested person who checked me in. - The completely disengaged person who checked me out. I didn't know it was possible that a person whose job description includes ""making people feel welcome"" could actively be so unwelcoming. - The awesome thin towels that had the threads hanging off them. I am a small person and it took all two towels to dry my body.- The lack of room amenities, what happened to the good old days of a glass for water or a kettle for tea or somewhere to put your clothes as opposed to hanging them on the wall. Those are just the top contenders, I am sure if I thought about it for more than 10 seconds I could add some more. The nicest part about the hotel was the gentleman who took my bags, he was lovely and kind and didn't seem to mind that I had no clue where to go or what to do because there was no one else to ask.

A client booked me at the Moxy because I said I prefer a Marriott group hotel, and they had a specific budget allocation. So it ended up being the Moxy. Some highlights: No desk, chair or lamp; awkward layout for using a computer and power plugs; awkward way of ironing clothes (on a tiny, flimsy ironing board set up in the sink!); managing business clothes and space (no closet, just hooks on a wall); noisy guests (1:30am crowd in front of my room with no regard for other guests); sitting on a bed trying to get work done ...is not enjoyable.

The Moxy is funky, hip, and puts out a social vibe that I’ve never seen in a hotel before. We were able to drop off our bags because we got there too early to check in. We checked in after 4pm and got a double double room on the 12th floor. That turned out to be two double beds set up foot to foot, cool right? The decor and space saving perks were great. I’ll get to the cautionary stuff in a minute. The second floor had a bar and comfortable places to sit and relax. That was great. There was also a rooftop bar that I heard was great but we didn’t get up there because... The elevators.... oh how I would have loved it if there were step by step directions posted somewhere near the elevators so we could figure out how to use them. Basically you tell the elevator where you want to go and it will tell you which elevator to get on, the trick comes when you want to go to floors that have guest rooms. You have to scan your card. Unless someone is standing there that already knows how to use the elevator, you’ll be sitting there for a really long time wondering why you can’t do a simple task like call an elevator. We figured it out though... eventually.. and by eventually, I mean on the day we left. So no rooftop bar for us. As to the cautionary tale, here goes... if you are a family or with a group of friends who do not normally watch each other shower or use the toilet, here’s your warning. The bathroom and shower can be seen into by whoever is outside of it. If you aren’t into that, you can either shower and use the bathroom in shifts or maybe bring something to put up so you can’t see each other. I don’t know... I like my privacy as does the teenage son. I really like this hotel a lot but this issue kind of makes me want to look elsewhere next time. Except for the bathroom issue, the location is perfect, EggHead is yummy and I’d recommend.","Landisville, Pennsylvania","haus1904</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Landisville, Pennsylvania</strong>",12,4.0

This is what they say millennial travelers want: small but perfectly adequate rooms with cool common space to hang out and work if you want to. As others have noted, the rooms are not really geared toward working or even spending much time in them. That said, my queen room was actually bigger than some rooms I have had in a traditional NYC hotel. The room is a bit barebones, not fancy, but I liked it fine. I was also pleasantly surprised by how good the service was from the front desk where the young woman who checked me in could not have been nicer or more efficient, as was also true of the bartender working the breakfast crowd. Everyone I encountered was great and a more traditional hotel could learn from these folks. The main issue I encountered was noise, some from being in the middle of the City but I could also hear other people's showers as if it were in my own room, and conversations in the hallway. This hotel feels like a rooming house and while others may not care, this was the only negative to me. I was traveling alone (and am older) and I think the room definitely would have been cramped if anyone else had been with me. I did not, however, hear any noise from the rooftop bar and I attribute that to the front desk person when I asked for a quiet room.

The desk is minuscule and the seat is simply reclining one, not good if you need to work on a computer. The rooms is noisy and you can hear people coming in and out of the rooms. The lifts are not convenient and The touch screens was difficult to operate. The communal areas are noisy and The breakfast is extortionate (11usd for a small bowl of oatmeal). On the positive side, the manager was responsive but only when cornered and the shower is powerful and nice.Overall not a hotel I would recommend if you are looking for something comfortable and business like or even for a couple. It is too much unnecessary extra and not enough substance. Could have done with investing in the amenities and the training of the staff instead of all the necessary flashy things.","London, United Kingdom","0481Tony</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",31,2.0

I also stayed here last year with family!Having got there at around 7 pm in the day I grabbed my room key and headed upstairs to the room to just throw everything in and go out as I was only there for 3 nights. You could barely open the door, we were coming from Orlando and had 2 suit cases and with them in the room, there was absolutely no room to get ready. These rooms are really only suitable for 1 person (it was a double room). Having said that, I did mention it to reception and the manager (Mike) went above and beyond to get our room moved and did so. We were changed to a different double room with the perfect amount of space. The rooms themselves are among the cleanest ive ever been in but in fairness so is the whole hotel. The place just smells amazing and there is not a spec of dirt anywhere. The staff are super super friendly which was a pleasant change from my visit last year. The showers are magnificent, they are the rain forest showers which are the most refreshing thing in the morning and at night. You couldn’t be in a better location if you’re visiting Times Square, it is literally in the centre of it. The hotel bar is insanely expensive and while it is nice, you can go and drink in a rooftop terrace for a fraction of the money. I would have given this a 4/5 if I had have been given the larger room from th start, but I only stayed 3 nights and 1 was in the insanely uncomfortable tiny double room.

We chose this hotel based on location and looks online. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel overall, with a few annoyances. The location can't be beat, you walk out the door and look down the street and Times Square is right there. The rooms were quite small though, we had a king bed room, and I found the temperature in the room quite difficult to regulate for some reason. Perhaps it is because the room is so small, turning the a/c on and it is RIGHT against the right side of the bed so it gets overly chilly when sleeping. If you turned it off the room got super muggy even though it was October when we visited. I honestly think a ceiling fan right above the bed would have made it perfect. Other than the temperature and the fact that the room was quite small it was exactly as it looked online. I liked the styling of it and there was no issues at all with cleanliness. Self check in and out was super easy. One thing I found about this hotel is it is a VERY young hotel. I felt a bit old at this hotel. I would guess that the target age for guests would be hipster 20's and 30's which we are not. I didn't find the hotel staff to be overly friendly nor any of the other guests here. It seemed a bit stuffy and pretentious. The waitress in the hotel lounge wasn't friendly at all, drinks are certainly on the pricey side, unsurprisingly since it is NYC after all. The hotel just lacked the warmth and comfort I enjoy when I am away from home.Most of my issues were not a fault of the hotel and I would have no qualms recommending it to anyone.

Stayed at the hotel with my husband for 2 nights (Sun-Tue). We had two separate reservations (one points and one paid). I requested the Suite Night Award for both nights and just received one for the 2nd night (points night). Breakfast - 4At check-in we received ""chips"" for breakfast. The breakfast was served in the hotel bar area (2nd floor). The menu had a good variety of options and the food was delicious. We only had the yogurt with granola, honey and fresh blueberries (yummy), but the egg dishes looked really good and we heard the other guests provide good feedback on the food. The waiter that served us both mornings was really great! I didnt get his name, but he was very attentive and was always checking in to make sure we were ok. Amazing service! We also received 2 complimentary prosecco drinks with each check-in.Responsiveness - 1.5I had emailed the hotel prior to the visit with some inquiries related to the rooftop bar (emailed about 4 times) and did not receive any responses back. I understand the rooftop technically run by a third-party, but a response would've been appreciated.While at the hotel, I also wanted to reserve one of their Studios (conference rooms), and was told that the only way to reserve a Studio is to send an email to a specific group with the request. I sent an email with the request but never received a response. To give the hotel some credit, when I checked in and communicated via the Marriott app, the responses were fine. It was just an issue when emailing the hotel - email address obtained from Instagram profile and thw second email issue was with respect to reserving the studio.Rooms:King Corner - 3.5The first night we stayed at the hotel, we were upgraded to a King Corner Room (from regular King) which was decently sized for NYC standards. If you've read the reviews, by now you know this is a unique hotel...and therefore, certain things are a little different than what you expect in other standard hotel rooms. For example, the sink and mirror are located outside of the bathroom in the main ""bedroom"" area, there is no closet (there are hangers along the wall where you hang your clothes but for longer trips, things may get messy), there is no real desk area (so for business trips, this may not be the best option). Also, there is an area called the ""Shed"" on each floor. The rooms at the hotel don't have an iron or an ironing board (there is a garment steamer though), but you can borrow such items from the Shed (can also get extra toiletries, towels, etc).The Suite - 5The suite was another story - I loved the suite (see pics)! It had a nice layout (was a corner room) and was spacious! There was a nice kitchenette area, a living room with a corner couch on one side, and a ""bedroom"" on the other side with a king-sized bed (there was no true divider to the bedroom, but it was definitely a cool layout). There was also a little desk where you could work located in between the livingroom and kitchenette. The bathroom was in its own space as well. Also, the staff included a personalized note for me on the mirror in the bathroom area, which was a nice touch.The suite definitely made up for some of the inconveniences we experienced. Unfortunately, if it wasnt for the suite, I would have probably given the hotel a 3-star review.Overall, it is a nice modern hotel and is conveniently located especially if you're in NYC to be near Times Square or the Theater District. I would stay at this hotel again (for a quick trip to the city, and when not planning on relying on any urgent responses from the hotel). Getting another suite upgrade confirmed would also be a plus! :)-Patrycja savitraveljournal.com","Miami, Florida","PatrycjaSavi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",8,4.0

But they don’t. The only reason I stayed at this hotel in the first place is for 4pm checkout under their “social media package” as I needed to work and wanted a quiet place to do so (I even called Marriott to confirm that I had 4pm checkout after I reserved the room and was assured I did). The package was to include two Hot Toddies and 4pm checkout. I was never offered the drinks (which is awful customer service). But what’s even worse is the harassment I received after I didn’t checkout by 11. I got calls. I got an email. I got threatened that I as going to be charged additional money. I received numerous knocks on the door. As of now, this still isn’t resolved. For the price paid I expected much more. This is a complete failure by Marriott and the Moxy.",,Stufffnthings,1,2.0

Some of the extras such as the stash and the candy bar are not stocked. Nowhere to sit in the lobby, staff are too busy trying to be cool and we were treated poorly at the rooftop. The decor tries and fails to be interesting, breakfast is dull and repetitive. Whilst the location is good citizen M is much better. Best to avoid if you want to sleep at anytime. Bed tiny and had a tv at the foot which was knocked while sleeping. The ridiculous ‘art’ positioned idiotically needs to go. More shelf’s and storage needed.

Unfortunately as is often the case first impressions are hard to overcome. Arrived late about 11pm. Only one staff in lobby....although he only had to check in one room it took about 20 minutes. Mobile check in did not work. When my time came, I was told they did not have my room, then suddenly the agent told me he was leaving and left the check in process to a newly arrived staff. No uniforms, could have been street guys for all I know. “So we don't have your room category, that ok right?” When I said it was not he simply responded with a smile. Rooms are TINY which is New York, but the mostly glass bathroom is a bit complicated for any sort of privacy. I did not mind the design but not as thoughtful as Citizen M for example and the darker colors makes it even smaller. Gym is an after thought which is shameful for a hotel that size I think. 7:30pm I had to call to have the room made up, apparently “you must have had your do not disturb sign on” which I did not. Only real hats off are the bar and the restaurant. Though bar service was non existent, the location, ambiance, screen makes for a great place to have a drink and catch up on e-mails.

Their are flags on light posts all around New York stating what district you are in - the one outside the door into hotel - says Garment District. We booked it based on being in Time Square so we could easily go down wait in rush lines - and go back to room. Middle of Time Square was at least a 20 minute walk.I called back after making my reservation and was told our request for early check in was not recorded or request for extra towels. I called the day before we left and the morning on our drive up and was told again the request was not on our reservation, but they would add it. When we tried to check in - I was told again - no request recorded but they would try to accommodate this and send extra towels up. We were able to check in at 12:40 which was great - but did not have any extra towels.When we called to ask question about booking the website and the person we spoke to says there is parking not affiliated with the hotel next door. When we arrived at the hotel we there were trucks delivering items to hotel blocking the entrance to the parking garage next door. When we asked how long this would take that we were trying to park our car we were told by the hotel that we did not request parking on our reservation and so they could not help us - which makes no sense at all because we were told they could not help us with parking when we made the reservation.We did not have sheets on are bed when we got back to room at midnight. Called down and they delivered sheets - which when we went to put them on our bed we saw they were badly stained. We called front desk again and housekeeping came and asked us to show them the stains and when we showed them asked if we wanted replacements. When we said yes we realized the new new sheets had blood on them - at this point we walked down hall and found sheets in a bin and retrieved are own.The next night we went back to our room and the bunk bed was not made - and the sheets had been taken off the main bed and put on top of the comforter. We also did not have towels again. When we called down to the front desk we were told there is a stash room that is self serve and we can retrieve anything we need there. Again if I paid for a cheaper type hotel this would have been fine.The room resembles a youth hostile - which would have been fine had we paid those prices but we paid prices equal to what we could of gotten on time square at one of the named recognized hotels.The toilet and shower are in same space - as if you are on a boat. There is not shower curtain separating them even which makes for that entire area to get wet and is a mess if you wish to go to the bathroom after you shower.The roof top bar they advertise does not appear to be part of the hotel at all - and we could never even see what it looked like because the line outside was so long.The front desk did give us a credit because of our sheet issues and the person we spoke to was very very nice but it is just not something you want to deal with at midnight when you walked 20 minutes to a hotel that was supposed to be in Time Square and you have a teenager with you that is exhausted.My 14 year old by day 2 said she was getting grossed out by the lack of cleanliness issues.At one point another guest was asking why some people had passes to breakfast - which it says on the website you get through August 31 by the way. The host said that the front desk gives them out at there discretion and sent them on there way.Would never stay here again.","Severn, Maryland","Debbie V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Severn, Maryland</strong>",1,1.0

At around 6.35pm I began to worry that the car was delayed, I went to speak to a receptionist. To my horror I was informed that that my booking was not recorded by a staff member. Another worker tried to book a yellow taxi which I explained profusely that it would not fit all our luggage and passengers. The result of this ordeal ended in being squashed in a taxi and having cases unsafely stored in the front seat of the taxi. Our flight was a international flight which caused us a great deal of stress with the thought of missing it. I understand that we all make mistakes but in my opinion booking a car to the airport should be a serious priority. I was mostly disheartened by the hotels unconcerning manner.

We made it back to Charlotte on Friday afternoon and Michelle is feeling much better. She is resting and will continue with medication and therapy to help her back. The good news is that it appears to be a muscular injury and not disc, probably as a result of moving our son to college, heavy lifting and a lot of walking. I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to your staff! I can’t thank you enough for your kindness, empathy and professionalism. It truly represents a BEST is the Standard culture. This was only the second trip to New York for Michelle and the girls and my first trip back in over 30 years. Needless to say, it was extremely intimidating to look down and see my wife hurting and unable to stand, my teenage daughters standing there, our bags sitting in the lobby and a fifteen-minute window to leave for the airport in order to catch our return flight home. Can you say stressed out? As soon as I asked for help from one staff member, a gentlemen I believe who works in food and beverage, we found ourselves surrounded by other managers, security and the Hotel Manager, Brandon Scamfer. Again, your staff responded with care, empathy and professionalism. After quickly assessing the situation your team went to work taking care of our family. The ambulance was contacted and brought in to pick up my wife. Your team escorted our girls and took our bags back to the room we had previously been in. This was HUGE…and allowed me to feel safe about the girls and allowed me to focus on my wife’s care. You offered to assist with the airlines if we had any problems. You offered to feed the girls or provide anything they needed while we were at the hospital. I received multiple calls while in the ER attempting to check on us. Michelle was admitted and held for observation overnight. During which time flowers, a care package and note were sent to the girls in our hotel room. Wow…. All I can say is First Class and thank you! Please share this with your team and tell them how grateful we are for the care that was extended to my family! It truly made a difference and made a lasting impression. Our trip to New York had been great, our stay at the Moxy had been great and even with this injury, the way your team responded, we only see a Great experience!Again, thank you and we will absolutely be back again and wouldn’t consider staying anywhere but the Moxy Time Square!Sincerely, Mike Minor",,mikemD9696WI,0,5.0

I wish I had a better experience while traveling for work and staying at this hotel. Yes the room is small, but it’s fine if you’re like me when you travel and you don’t spend much time in your room. The room I stayed in was extremely noisy. I could hear the noise from the 2nd floor bar until it closed. One night that was until 1am... Then another night, there was construction noises coming from inside the hotel. We’re talking a saw, drilling, hammering - and of course I could hear the workers talking when the noises stopped. When I called to the front desk I was told the manager that scheduled it had no idea it would be so loud and they were trying to end it ASAP. This lasted from about 1am-almost 5am (I don’t know when it actually ended... I stopped looking at the time at some point near 5). I was in NY for work... all I was expecting from my hotel was a place to sleep and shower, and I didn’t get one of those things. When I asked the next morning, the manager on duty was vague and was going to look in to it more. He was supposed to call me with what they found out. I took recordings of the noises on my phone and he did not want to hear them. And I received no call. I asked that evening when I returned back to the hotel from work and that person all of a sudden claimed it was street construction noise to which I said no it wasn’t and again asked if they wanted to hear my recordings and they said no. I got only a credit of $70 for the noise complaint - not the full night. I am not a person that complains - I have been at a hotel where a roach flew out of my bath mat in the morning and didn’t complain or fuss. I have sent back 1 meal in my lifetime because it was too cold and asked them to just throw it in the microwave... but this was ridiculous. The lack of care from the managerial team and ownership of an error is appalling. I get it - mistakes happen. Own it and since you’re in the customer service and hospitality industry, hear your customer out and make it right. ",,414sarahk825,0,1.0

The hotel has a young hip vibe, with loud music playing in the lobby checkin area and on the elevators. I was told I was upgraded to a queen bed from a full bed room. I was on the 16th floor. Evidently the preferred clients are on lower floors and are provided extra amenities. My room was extraordinarily noisy since the rooftop bar was rocking until 4am. There are no ear plugs provided in the room. I was told on my second night there when I called the front desk at 2am, that I could go to the hallway stash room to get some, or I could have someone deliver some. Well at 2am, I was not going to get dressed for either. I collected some the next day for the remainder of my trip. Of course when paying a lot of $ for a room, why should I also be uncomfortable wearing ear plugs. I was told from staff that they get complaints from floor 10 up. So definitely try to get on a lower floor if you decide to stay here. My room had no dresser, desk or closet. There were hooks on the walls for hanging clothes. There is a big shower with a rain drop shower head. Plenty of hot water. They have hair conditioner and the Shampoo/body wash in combined in one in large jars in the bathroom. They do not provide body lotion or shower caps in the rooms. However I did find both in the stash closet. They have small cartons of water in the room you can pay $5 for. (Buy a jug at CVS for your stay.) Safe provided under bed. Large TV screen on the wall. There is a magnifying mirror in the room but the lighting is so dark, you can’t see the details anyways. There was a full length mirror in the room. Bed and bedding was fine. My room was provided two paper cups. One I used for my toothbrush. The other I used for drinking. It was never replaced on a six night stay. On the 5th night, by my bedside, an ant found my cup with water. When I called & I asked for a replacement cup, the staff brought me choice between a paper cup and a plastic glass. This is how I know the lower floors have more amenities. I do have a Marriott account, but the front desk couldn’t find it to add my reservation. They told me accounts are deleted from their system if they are inactive for a year. I phoned Marriott today and their computer knew me by my phone number. The rep found my account quickly and added my reservation. Perhaps this is why they put me on the 16th floor. Also, the rooms are so close to the neighboring buildings, you must keep the blinds shut 24/7. Otherwise not only will people be looking at you, you will see them. I would not stay here again unless I was provided a ridiculously inexpensive rate that could not be repeated elsewhere.

Was worried this hotel would come across as too trendy, but it was perfect. The location is great with access to many different subway lines only 2 blocks away. You are only a short walk or subway ride from Times Square and there is always a lot of activity going on in the area. Only a few blocks north of Madison Square Garden. Plenty of good places to eat in the area as well. However, if you are looking for a hotel with a view, look elsewhere. We were on the 12th floor and you are surrounded by taller buildings and though it didn't matter to us, if you want a view of NYC, try requesting a much higher floor and try your luck there. They do have a rooftop bar and club that supposedly offers great views of NYC though. The check-in process was quick, fast, and they give you 2 free drink tokens per person for their bar on the second floor. The elevators are unique but a great concept. There are 4 of them so they don't take too long to arrive. If you want to go to your room, you go to one of the 2 panels near the elevators and select your floor number and then you have to scan your room card. It then programs your floor into one of the four elevators and tells you which one to wait for. There are no buttons inside and I felt it was a nice security feature. There is always upbeat music playing which makes the elevator ride a little more fun.  The rooms aren't the largest, but decent for a New York style hotel room. Had a queen room and we had plenty of room for our luggage and to move around. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The tv is mounted on the wall right in front of the bed making it very convenient. The sink is in the main area of the room but not in the way to cause any problems. The bathroom is very nice with a stand up shower area with a rain shower head. This was one of the best features of the room and very nice and relaxing after a long day of walking around New York City.  This was a great experience and you cannot beat the location or price. We would absolutely come back and stay here again. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.","Detroit, Michigan","Digger0713</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",19,5.0

Rooms are comfortable and stylish but a glass door to the bathroom might be unsuitable for some people who are sharing the room with someone else! There is also very little storage space - there are a lot of pegs on the wall to hang items, and one small drawer under each bed. There are many good perks such as free coffee in the mornings and vending machines on site. We had no noise from the streets from our room, or from other rooms but we did have really noisy pipes in the walls which we told staff about but nothing was done about it.Legasea restaurant:We ate here a couple of times. Breakfast isn't the best buffet selection. Meals are very expensive, but food is good and service is too - very attentive. Can get very noisy in the evening.Rooftop Bar:We had booked brunch here for our last day, with the idea being the two teenagers with us could use the mini golf. Statues of naked bunnies were amusing for us, but maybe not appropriate to someone bringing their kids up there! The service there was poor. We asked if it was possible to sit in the shade, but we were told the shaded table was reserved by someone else. That would be acceptable, but these shaded tables remained unoccupied all the time we were there...We ordered coffee, which took 15mins to arrive. We realised it was because the coffee machine had broken and our server had to go downstairs to use the machine, but she did not explain this or apologise for the wait. We asked if we could order another coffee, and she pulled a face and said ""I can't use the elevator again..."" which translated at ""I can't be bothered"". I think this is poor as many people would be expecting coffee first thing in the morning! Perhaps customers could have been told this upon arrival, as it's hardly cheap so service should not be this poor.",,MotherLeopard,0,3.0

This is my repeated stay at the Moxy chain - the last experience in Tokyo was amazing so I told my friends to stay here during our NYC trip. I checked in on 9 August around 22:00 and am staying for 6 nights. The check-in experience wasn't that great to begin, the staff struggled to find my booking and once she managed to get me a room she simply took my credit card and handed me the key cards. The impression of being welcome? Negative. The check-in counter is funky dark that I had to venture my way to the elevators. The rail that holds the bed's head panel was broken, the AC track gives weird and loud noise that the engineer proved that's beyond his ability to repair as the noise was coming from the compressor. The design of it is problematic as the cold air practically blows right behind one's head when lying in the bed. The room was not allocated on the quiet side as in the booking request. The shower doors are poorly configured, so it causes ridiculous seepage. With all these I expressed the discontent with the night shift manager who called me to offer a $50 for the first night due to the inconvenience caused, as it's late and full occupancy, he would arrange me to another room solving at least the AC problem for the subsequent 5 nights.No one reached out to arrange a room change. While I checked with the front desk at around 7pm coming back from a day out, the lady, without genuinely enquiring my situation nor the room I stayed, bluntly informed me it was 100% occupancy and she couldn't do anything about it; and said if I wanted to change room, I should check with them around noon time. She literally transferred the responsibility to the frustrated customer - me. This is not the acceptable service any hotelier gives to its customers.

The perfect location! Everything is either a stones throw away or within walking distance. The look and ambience of the hotel are very modern. Checking in and checking out was very easy. Loved the on site restaurants as well as the amazing roof top bar which has an amazing view. The only things I would change would be the size of the room as I felt they were too small but on the plus side they were very modern. An additional thing I would change would be the incense used in the hotel as at times it was a bit over powering. What made my experience even more special was the excellent customer service I experienced from the moment I entered the hotel to the moment I left especially from one individual in particular, Sade Garcia. Sade was attentive, full of energy, super friendly and very helpful. She informed me of all of the hotels amenities as we all what events were happening in the hotel especially the rooftop bar. She was even kind enough to recommend local restaurants/eateries, bars and the best tourist spots. What made it even more special was the fact that on several occasions during her break she helped me get a cab and waited until it arrived, something I have never experienced while staying in a hotel. She made the whole process of checking in and checking out easy and stress free! In my eyes she went above and beyond which is something everyone should experience. She is an asset to the company and I believe a lot of people can learn from her great customer service skills. I will definitely be coming back this year!

In this case, it’s trying way too hard to be a W but falling short in many aspects. I’m a grown man who just stayed there on a five-day business trip and I’m definitely not the clientele they are going after. This hotel is for under-30 travelers who don’t care about basic comforts in order to save a few bucks and feel like they are staying in a European nightclub.On the plus side, there are no ridiculous resort fees (as is the NYC trend), there are good restaurants and bars on the property, and the location is centrally located in NYC and Times Square.Here are the drawbacks:Check-in process is supposed to be easy and people-free. But the technology isn’t there yet so you end up needing a person anyway to get your room number or help you anyway. They need to improve this. I couldn’t find a human to help when I needed it.Same goes for the elevators. They try to be all tech-savvy but the user interface is clunky and frustrating. You have to hit a variety of buttons on a screen and swipe your room card and then wait before getting on an elevator. A simple elevator where you just hit one button to go to your floor is much easier and better for the customer experience. I had to try to find a staff member to help a few times until I got used to it.Reliance on technology around the hotel including restaurant and coffee bar also made it actually more difficult to get anything. I found myself needing to find an actual human to buy something simple like breakfast. Rooms were very, very tiny and like a hostile. In an effort to look “cool,” they took away basic comforts like a closet to hang your clothes and dresser drawers. Instead, there were weird hooks on the walls and tiny cubby spaces under the bed. Bed was like a futon and pressed against the wall and window. Room was not quiet as facing the street. Towels were thin and not plush at all. The free coffee in the morning is a plus other hotels can learn from. But they should put it out earlier as I had to wait around until 6:30 for it every morning. Most annoying was the loud dance music pumping out of the speakers everywhere at all hours, including first thing in the morning on the elevators and in the hallways. Silence is golden in morning hours. Too early for that. It’s not a club.They were also trying too hard to be hip with games everywhere, including a stupid bean bag toss game right at the front door that people played as you tried to walk in.The gym was spacious and clean but still overcrowded and FULL of people just sitting on the machines and equipment staring -4 their cell phones and not working out (this is despite a rules sign saying that no cell phone use is permitted on the gym floor). These people took up all of the space and every machine, and I had to wait or ask them to leave so I could work out. They need to post bigger signs and tell the cell phone addicts to please go to the lobby to read articles or stare at Instagram. Same people coincidentally were the ones who wouldn’t wipe the machines and benches down before or after they used it. Weird.Clientele of hotel skewed very young and European, but lots of smartphone addicts everywhere staring at Instagram and walking into you/not paying attention to where they were going. Almost everyone in the public spaces of this hotel was walking around like a zombie glued to their phones. Weird and eerily like the Walking Dead! Disturbing.Overall, not a comfortable or customer-friendly experience though I did like the independence and not having to deal with staff sticking their hands out at you for tips at every turn for services you don’t need (valet, baggage, etc.) The downside is when you do need a human to help you do something basic like use the elevator you can’t find one.I wouldn’t stay there again but for the right person it might work!","Los Angeles, California","Ian D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",13,2.0

We liked the location, just over a mile south of Central Park and a little less to Times Square. Easy to walk to or take subway (lots of stations nearby) to get to all of the tourist attractions.The room setup was great. I had a queen while my daughter had a single bunk bed above (no sharing of beds!). She loved the bunk bed as it gave her her own space. Overall, yes the room is small - similar to the size of a room on a cruise; but, like a cruise you are not spending time in your room other than to sleep, shower and change clothes. It works. Overall, the hotel staff and ambience is nice. It’s a boutique-hipster feel hotel so lots of younger hotel guests but still lots of families walking around. Fitness center is adequate. Lots of ellipticals, treadmills and free weights - best part is that everything is working! Also had some free weights. The room would benefit from a fan - can get stuffy. Only complaint happened in the last moments. We booked a car service through the hotel to get to LGA. We were quoted a flat rate of $55. When the service picked us up you could see on the visible iPad of our plan, $55. When we got out he charged us $65. I hate that deception. Not sure if he was concerned I wasn’t going to tip so he worked in his own but that is not cool and looks bad on the hotel. Since he inflated the rate he didn’t get a tip. I would suggest the hotel collect payment for service so that guests are not being overcharged for services or find a more reputable car service.","Louisville, Kentucky","OffWeGoAgain_502</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",0,4.0

No apology or customer service, just people making you feel you were an inconvenience. Branded water cartons in room but no mention of these being chargeable. Used twice and charged $10 a time on checkout. 2nd floor bar was ridiculously expensive and no beer of any kind on draft. $9 for a 330cl can of Peroni and $17 for a small glass of sauvignon blanc (plus tips).Hotel's focus seemed to revolve around their roof top bar where I can only presume the staff make the most in tips and the hotel in revenue. Streams of people coming and going for that which meant there was no sense of relaxation.""Security"" held lifts in reserve for roof top bar customers and were unfriendly and ignorant. Most staff had a superior couldn't care less attitude unless they were tapping you up for a tip.2nd floor bar frequently had one person taking up a 4 seat area on their laptops without even using the bar. No idea if they were even resident. Nobody seemed to mind.

Unfortunately my experience was the worst I've had in my time as a Marriott loyalist and I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone - especially a woman traveling by herself!I checked into the hotel with a woman named Sade. She gave me keys to my room and I went upstairs. When I tried the room, it didn't work. I proceeded to go back downstairs and wait in line to ask her again for keys that worked. She gave me new keys and I verbally confirmed the room number with her. I went back upstairs and the keys worked this time - however, there was already a man staying in the room. He started yelling which scared me, and we both realized that the hotel had put us in a dangerous situation. As a female executive who travels frequently by myself, this was unequivocally one of the worst scenarios I have ever faced in a hotel - especially in a ""clubby"" hotel in midtown Manhattan. It is dangerous and unacceptable. However, the situation only became worse when I went back downstairs and asked Sade to speak to the manager (named Francusco). As Francusco tried to help me, Sade stood by his side with her arms crossed rolling her eyes at me. She did not apologize once through this whole process. After I told her to stop rolling her eyes at me, she walked over to another guest service agent and proceeded in a loud voice to berate me while Francusco continued to try to help me (and calm down the other guest in the room where I had entered). While Fracusco was trying to help me, he didn't believe me when I told him Sade was rolling her eyes at me and talking about me to the other guest service agent. I was facing her - he wasn't. At this point, as a female traveling alone, I didn't feel comfortable staying at this property and asked him to help me switch properties. He insisted on trying to comp my room at his property (I wasn't interested) so I booked the Edition (a brand by Marriott I actually trust) on my phone. As I mentioned, I have stayed at Starwood and Marriott properties consistently for 12+ years and was genuinely looking forward to trying this brand. At this point, I cannot advise any female traveling alone to stay here. Not only was I put in an incredibly unsafe situation, but I was ridiculed when I tried to reconcile it with the manager.

The look and feel of the hotel was what I have always expected, but I was pretty disappointed with the customer service. Our first issue was with the pricing of the room, which was a bit of a Marriott issue rather than the hotel issue, but when I brought it up to the manager, they said they could do nothing about the issue and that I needed to contact Marriott, which I did. At that time I also let him know that our room had not been serviced and I called more than a half hour ago for new towels. He said he would get right on it. 20 minutes later... nothing. Then we called again for towels and the lady on the other end of the line said I see that it was requested, and I don't know why there was a hold up. 20 minutes later... towels. Then when we returned home I saw there was a receipt for $0 for my stay, but when I found a $400 charge on my credit card for the hotel which should only have been around $240, I called again. They said that it was just a confirmation charge and that it should change in about 4-6 days and I should check back. I have NEVER had that happen before. Crazy business management. It's like amateur hour, business-wise. The hotel is nice and has a certain European feel. The restaurant on site is excellent-Legasea. The drinks at the hotel are uber-expensive. $15 mixed and $10 beers. The night club on the roof takes over the hotel at night. There are all kinds of people through the hotel and it is pretty chaotic. The bouncers aren't going to smile at you, so don't expect that. Also, when you get to the roof, all the tables are reserved, so you'll be lucky to get to the bar.Like I said, while it is a nice looking hotel, I would not recommend this hotel.

The room I was given was equivalent to a college dorm room. It has no closets. It has no desk. The bed had no room to walk around-an inch from the wall at the foot.  The room they stuck me in, as a supposed elite customer and prior customer at the hotel, had a “loft” bed overhead, like a bunk bed. So if you sat up from the pillows your head would hit the wood support the bed above. To answer the phone I had to crouch down under the loft bed and try to read numbers in the dimly lit area. I asked to be moved. They patched me into “customer service,” who blurted “please hold” then disconnected me. I called back, asking to speak to the manager. I was told he was not available, but would call back in two minutes. I sat there for 20 minutes. No call. Called again, finally got through to the Manager. He offered me the same size room (220 square ft) with two double beds, before disconnecting me. I finally just said cancel my booking without charge, even though rooms were tight in the city, I would go through the effort of a re-booking somewhere. Although part of Marriott, he did not offer to re-book me at one of their many others hotels. On check out, he told the front desk person to not charge me and release the room. No apologies. I found another room at a great place at three times the size and half the price. Finishing touch: just got back to my office to find an email from Moxy, containing an invoice for $1185.49. They actually charged my credit card for two nights I wasn’t there, so I now have to dispute this bill. Ahh, but I forgot the wonderful NYC cityscape view. See the below photo looking out my window—I was staring at a brick wall 5 feet away. Get it together Marriott. This place cares about its rooftop lounge and 2nd floor lounge/bar. Unless you are a Hobbit, avoid it. If you actually want a regular room, desk, (iron) and responsive service, go somewhere else.

I came back to my room the next day and it wasn't fixed and the socket face was still hanging off, there was no offer to change rooms. At that point I'd given up on telling them about the issue.

This is not what you expect for the price we paid for our stay and for a Marriott hotel. 2) When visiting the Magic Hour rooftop bar, we spent a significant amount of money on food and drink and were then almost thrown out as the bar was closing - despite the fact that the staff were at fault as they were being slow to return our credit cards. On exiting the bar, we were very quickly shuffled into the lift as the bouncer clearly wanted to shut the club and go to bed - not what you expect when you spend almost $400 on the bill.Overall, very disappointed - I would describe the hotel as prioritising style over substance.

Fantastic location, very functional room, different, but different can be good, as long as you are different and open for new things, things you are might not used to, yet. Some walking minutes away from Times Square Moxy welcomes you with a lobby which is minimalistic, 6 spots with terminals where you are c/i or c/o, the Moxy crew greats you and assist you wherever needed. You can directly feel, that it is meant to be for the next generation, ones you are c/i you receive your room key, without that key, nothing is possible, wrong, you can actually walk upstairs to the massive ""Lounge"", bar, place to socialize and be connected. Play table football, enjoy some snacks, have a drink and work, the idea is to spend time here on your tablet, phone, laptop. It's seriously a great place, we loved the idea of the table football and the snacks were great. We very much enjoyed our time and our drinks. During the day, this area is packed and it is getting less crowded during the evening, which doesn't mean it is empty. Back to receiving the key: once you received your room key, this key will allow you to call one of the four elevator. Without the key, only the crew will be able to call you an elevator, in case you must store your luggage, while your room isn't ready or after you checked out, the luggage storage is located in the basement, very convenient and easy. Once you navigated through the display of the elevator and confirmed with your room key, the display will indicate which elevator to take, don't try to take an elevator which just arrived but doesn't match with what the display told you, it won't work. Once in the right elevator, some hip music will bring you up to your floor and the signs on each floor will bring you to your room, easy. Once in your room, you will be amazed what you can do with certain amount of space. We were amazed. We LOVED the bunk bed room concept, so did the kids. The message written on the mirror gave a nice personal touch, so did the balloons, confetti and candies for the kids, that was it, Moxy concept sold, once the kids are happy, the parents are happy. Little touches here and there made the room feel warm and welcoming. The ""old"" disc phone, the concept of the bathrooms, the tiles in the shower, etc., all those small details just perfectly fit into the whole concept. chairs and table were tucked away on the wall and could be taken out upon need, your cloth can be stored in drawers underneath the beds or placed on hangers around the room. For sure not the place you want to invite a guest but this isn't the idea, the idea is to sleep here but this is it. Use the bathrooms and spend the rest of your time, you spend in the hotel at the lounge. The room was quiet, the a/c worked well and the water pressure inside the shower was amazing, somehow we really loved the shower. Moxy offers you a restaurant, which is located as well on the first floor and connections to some other restaurants, located in the same building. A Barber and a Roof Top Bar are as well part of Moxy. If you feel like soft serve Ice Cream, Moxy got it, same as a ""convenient store"" all located on the first floor and part of the lounge. We loved our stay and can only recommend Moxy, try it, as long as you are open for being different.

I really loved the design. The small rooms were VERY clean. Loved the ""pod"" feel, the friendly staff and the price.BUT! There were two BIG issues I had with the Moxy, and they were deal breakers for me. Consider these before booking to make sure the Moxy is a good fit. The AC compressor is the headboard of the bed. The loud compressor roars at your head with blasts of cold air at regular intervals. I woke up constantly (even with earplugs). Staff said most rooms had that configuration but after I pushed (and they saw I was Gold), I switched rooms to where the compressor is along the bed at the left. I finally covered the vent with a blanket and slept warm to avoid the blasts. For those that are not light sleepers, this won't be an issue. The communication between housekeeping and front desk staff is poor. My room was cleaned twice in a week, despite my request that it be done between 11 and 6 because of work. I even talked with a member of the housekeeping staff on my floor as I left at 11 to say I left and could it please be done by 6, but it wasn't touched. I talked to the front desk twice. Finally, I bumped into a rock star supervisor (Jessica) who got my last day sorted. I suggest that you be very clear and ask to speak with a supervisor if you have an issue to make sure it's addressed. Not a big deal for those with normal hours, but for my needs, it was not a great week.

The location was terrific, close to subway, Penn Station, eateries, Times Square, shopping. Very convenient. The service was not so good. I called every night about the room.

It turns itself off if no one is in the room (how does it know no one is in the room?) - There was a broken window - the glass was not broken, but the inner part of the window was not within the windowsill track. So, hot air was coming in from the window. I think this is why the ac was not working consistently. It took hours to get someone to bring us a fan for the room. THE ROOM WAS SO HOT. It is the summer in NYC and when there is no ac and no way to open the window and no fan, what are you supposed to do? We took cold showers to cool off and when you get back into the room from the bathroom, it is hot again. Unbelievable.

Saturday night the nightclub was hopping (from what we could tell by the line outside and noise inside), but judging from the outfits on some of the young ladies, we were probably aged out of the that scene. We couldn't hear the music from our room, so party on!!Anyway, the room is tiny to the point of the bed reaching from wall to wall. There are plenty of hooks, but no closet and the bathroom has the toilet and shower with the sink just outside. Smallest room I've ever rented, but the atmosphere and location more than made up for it. The staff was mostly under 30 and were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. This being our first time in NYC, the staff was a definite help when needing transportation and dining advice. Our room was cleaned nicely, the lounge has a nice breakfast and the lobby always had something available (for example, the weather was supposed to be rainy, so the lobby had pink and white ponchos available to take).

The location was central and convenient to everything I wanted to see/do (as well as close to train and subway lines). Slightly confusing was that the address was 7th, but the hotel entrance was actually around the corner on 36th. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The property was clean and offered lots to do (games in the lobby, restaurants, bars, etc.). The elevators were slightly confusing as you had to use your room key to access the elevator (but not inside the elevator like usual, you had to ""badge in"" on the panel outside the elevator). The room was small (as expected), but it was perfect for me as a solo traveler. The room was clean and offered good amenities. Bed was comfy. Could have used more storage space (shelves, closet, drawers, etc.), but again for just me in the room it worked out fine. The bathroom was large (which was unexpected), clean, and offered a good selection of toiletries (also, if you forgot something like a toothbrush, each floor had a ""stash"" closet for extra towels, toiletries, and bedding). The shower was great, but I seemed to make a mess each time I showered because there wasn't a shower curtain. Everything about this room worked well for me as a solo traveler; staying here again with another person, I would definitely get a queen or king room. My only real complaint was that one of the electrical outlets in my room didn't work (there were only two, plus one in the bathroom); it was too complicated to have it fixed, but I just used the other one farther away from my bed. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends/family staying in NYC.

For starters, the luggage storage system is self service - meaning you have to venture to the basement and check it in yourself.

Also, a bellhop was about to help with my bag until he found out I was going to luggage storage and not my room, so he backed out, assuming, I guess, there would be no tip? Why not just have someone on staff check in bags from the ground floor and not require guests to go out of their way?

The location is fantastic if you want strolling distance to Times Square and pretty much any theatre you’d want to get to. The rooms whilst small are functional and you have to remember that it’s the middle or Manhattan and a decent rate. What’s not small however is the great full shower which is literally refreshing to have in New York accommodation. The small room size is more than made up for with the ample variety of common spaces downstairs ranging from lounge to desk spaces and games to full bar. Unfortunately where the hotel is let down is the chilled out vibe can border on disinterest from the staff. Common standard offerings like bar food at night and in room mini bar are absent. For the second day in a row our room was not made up, with seemingly no standard system in the hotel for dealing with that. The website alludes to a hotel rooftop bar but it’s actually just a space leased to another operator. So whilst a nice feature offers no special accessibility to in house guests (you ridiculously will have to go out the street to come back and use the same elevator you just took to your room) or room charge facility. It’s somewhat suffers from trying to be so cool it forgets to offer decent service. Overall the hotel is a great choice if you don’t care about hit and miss service but want a modern fresh place to stay in a great location. It’s busy and noisy but that’s a plus for as many of us as it is a negative. ","Gold Coast, Australia","djrappa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

Once last year for my best friends 30th birthday organised through a travel company and again as a returning customer on April 9th with 3 friends as an extension to our visit we made with our choir. The hotel is fun,hip and modern and until my recent experience I would have continued to be a returning customer, recommending to both friends and family. Not anymore! I wouldn’t stay there again or any of the Marriott hotels if you paid me! The lack of customer service is disgraceful. Me and my 3 friends checked into the Moxy... no problems there, we gave the Moxy my credit card details (as I had arranged everything) for the duration of our stay. We then checked out on the 11th April to find out they do not accept cash as payment, a pain but also not the end of the world so I agreed for them to use the credit card I had given to pay for the 2 rooms and my friends would pay me when my bill came in. A few days after returning back to the UK I noticed I had 3 separate payments on my card. 2 payments of $647.76 for the 2 rooms for the 2 nights and then another payment of $323.88. I have been in contact with Amex ever since disputing this charge and still, as I write this on the 8th June this has not been resolved. I thought the Moxy would have looked into this, saw this was a mistake in the system and reimburse me straight away. Instead it seems they have not even taken the time to look into this properly and have sent documents to Amex which shows this was a bill for 1 room on the 9th checking out on the 10th for 1 person? However we were 4 guests there for 2 nights? What annoys me the most is that I have sent 2 very lengthy emails to the Moxy FAO the manager and they have not even had the decency to respond to either of them! So it makes me question, is this just a system error or is this deliberate fraud/ theft? I have seen similar reviews on Trip advisor and I am now very concerned about using my credit card abroad again. We put our trust into hotels, giving our card details and it seems this can be very easily abused. I have made numerous phone calls to Amex and I have also sent copies of all email correspondence relating to my booking including me making the reservations back in 2018 and reconfirming the reservations early 2019. The emails clearly show dates, number of nights and all 4 guests names. I am not sure what else I can do? I just hope that someone at the Moxy looks into this again and using a-bit of common sense, realises the error they have made.

Every guest simply just uses the touch pad outside the lifts, chooses where they are going eg bedroom floor, bar, luggage room/fitness centre, then it tells you what lift to use, so remember don’t just jump in a lift as it might not be going where u want. I think it worked brilliantly, and wasn’t waiting long at all. The first thing you notice when you enter the hotel lobby is the smell, it was lovely, and a little sweets cart in the corner for you to help yourself! Perfect simple touches make all the difference. Plus 2 tokens for free processo in the bar, great start to the holiday, thank you! The hotel room itself I would say is rather small, but we did have the cheapest room so not sure what an upgraded room would be like, and the bed felt small and we aren’t big people, and although no you don’t spend a lot of time in your room, and this is my 3rd time in NYC and rooms are known to be small, but this is very small compared the the other ‘small’ rooms I’ve stayed in at other hotels, but on the plus side the best bathroom and walk in shower though, don’t usually get good showers when staying away but best shower I’ve had! We stayed on floor 7, so no music noise, but did have some general road noise but that’s to be expected I’m afraid. The air con was rather noisy, which to be honest aren’t most, but you do just get used to it and for a hot sunny stay it’s needed at night for summer. So with all this being said I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again, I would maybe just choose a bigger style room, as staff were brilliant, location was great, and I really liked the vibe. Also we asked for a late checkout and they said we could at 1pm for free, but we asked if we could pay for a later time at a charge of 50dollars till 4pm was brilliant! So again thank you, it made life much easier so we could enjoy our last day, and come back and freshen up for the 6hour flight home. Thanks for a great stay!

What a refreshing funky modern hotel. Lots of little perks and ads ons to make the stay easy.

The showers were amazing and just right pressure etc. Beds were comfortable and the room was well maintained. The stash which is on each floor, is brilliant as well for an extra pillow or two and guests can help themselves. The hotel was really busy and at times lifts took a while (something that is just part of life in this city) we were offered a free glass of champagne as part of being Elite customers. My only criticism for the weekend is the bar staff at the main hotel bar were rather unfriendly. ( visited 3 times and all 3 times staff really uninterested) I have recently read other reviews saying the same. I do agree that they need to take a leaf out of receptions staff because they really didn’t make for a nice atmosphere round the bar, so we quickly moved to the atrium out the way which was a nice chilled area to lounge around for a bit.

Very warm welcome from Michael who had a good bit of banter with my son and I about PlayStation games after spotting my son’s tshirt and all whilst checking us in with minimal hassle and explaining what was what.I had read some reviews about the lifts(elevators) but personally found them a breeze and actually a good system. Choose bedroom floors, then your floor and you’re told which lift to use I.e. P1 or P2 etc. Simple.Our room was as we’d expected. Small, well laid out and very clean. The bathroom with shower was great and to be honest, I’d happily give up a bit of bedroom space for that walk in shower. Really refreshing before and after a long day in the city.The cleaners did a great job daily and the front desk staff were very polite and willing to assist with anything. Great asset to the Moxy. However, I do feel that the bar staff could perhaps take a leaf out of the front desk staff’s book as the bar staff were miserable and despite me trying to engage them for the minimal amount of friendly small talk whilst ordering/being served, they were very cold and uninterested. Not sure that was just with me as I didn’t see them crack a smile with anyone. No great shakes I guess.Negatives: not many. 1) Irons in the rooms in stead of those pathetic steamers 2) some attention to the air con units when on cold/fan setting 3) drink prices at the main bar (we couldn’t use the rooftop one as with an 8yo) beer and cocktails were very expensive even for NYC imo. None of this spoilt it for us.

The area is full of big chains, nothing cool or independent and the noise at night is honestly next level. I wouldn’t say I’m a light sleeper normally but I slept really badly for the whole week because of it.This wasn’t helped by the fact that the air con sounded like a small truck was in the room (and as the weather was beautifully hot, we did suffer over night with over heating as we just couldn’t sleep with the air con on (it was up against the headboard).Another point to mention is that the shower is warm, but not even close to hot and it stayed this way the whole week. We did complain to reception on about day 3 about both the air con and the water, at which a point they said they would send up an engineer but it didn’t appear that anyone came to fix it. As a whole, I did feel that the room facilities were lacking, no safe, no kettle/tea or coffee making facility, no mini fridge . Which when you’re there for any period of time is really quite necessary and was sorely missed. On arrival we were given 4 tokens for a complimentary glass of champagne in the hotel bar. We decided to use the first two on our first night, but wished we hadn’t. The man behind the bar, emptied the bottom of a bottle of Prosecco in to two (wine!) glasses and looked pretty annoyed at having to do so, needless to say we didn’t stay for another drink and didn’t even go on to use our remaining tokens as it was just an uncomfortable experience.One part of the hotel that we were really looking forward to was the roof terrace which on the website looked super cool.The reality is that the terrace is accessed from a separate doorway outside of the hotel (even though there is actually a way that you could get there from inside the hotel) so that’s just annoying. Then once upstairs, you can’t actually just pop up for a drink as all of the tables seem to be reserved. The main area had very loud music playing, (this was at about 6pm, so was just way too much) but then there was a party on the separate end of the terrace who had a band playing and so there were actually two different musics being played over each other and it was just really an extremely unrelaxing environment, we then spent $55 on two drinks and a portion of fries after which we quickly left!! Not to mention that the pretty amazing view of the Empire State is quite severely obstructed by a huge, pretty ugly rotating chair!We ate in some really fab places during the week and as a result often came back on a night super full and as a typical English person, craving a cup of tea before bed. When I went to get one from the bar, I was disappointed to find that they couldn’t provide a cup/mug and my only option was to have it in a paper cup!! Just another thing that made me feel like we were paying a lot of money to stay in a basic hotel. Probably worth mentioning no option of room service either, which I realised when wanting to order drinks to the room one evening.I think the final but probably most annoying point is the severe problems with the lifts (elevators) they are operated using your room card, meaning you can’t just jump in if one is there but have to use a touch screen to order it to your floor etc. There were times when we waited 15 minutes for a lift, and didn’t get in to it at pretty much any point without having other guests complaining about having the same issues and about ready to pull their hair out, I can’t even explain how bad it was, it was honestly like a private joke between guests!!I’ve noticed on quite a few of the comments back from The Moxy on reviews below, that you feel that customers just haven’t ‘got the vibe’, but I really think that’s being misunderstood by yourselves.That is unless your desired vibe is, teeny tiny bedrooms, poor bedroom facilities, nightmare elevator experiences and bad nights sleep.I am 26 and my husband 24, and we were actually really looking forward to what looked like a cool, high end, funky hotel, but were left very disappointed. We stayed at the Hoxton in Paris last year, which I think has nailed the vibe that you are aiming for and we just wish that we’d stayed at their Williamsburg location on this holiday too.In fairness the interior decor was nice and the mattress was comfy.","York, United Kingdom","MrsB070718</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>York, United Kingdom</strong>",16,1.0

Our stay was quite pleasant at first, and the hotel had a clean room, a little small but had absolutely any amineities any guest could ask for. The hotel also had a nice rooftop.The main issue took place 2 days before we had to check-out, when, in the morning I open my zipped up laptop handbag, which I had kept next to my bed all week, to find that the envelope containing all my money, had been gone. Someone had clearly entered the room, unzipped the bag and taken it. As I ran down to tell the lobby about the situation, I was hopeful they may have a protocol to catch whoever did this, and find some way to help me out, as I had no idea how to go through the next 2 days, with no money to eat or even pay the hotel at check-out. Unexpectedly, the hotel did not take the matter seriously at all, the security staff present in the lobby was the only person willingly trying to get to the bottom of the issue, by trying to get the head of security on call, while the rest of the management in the lobby were totally unprofessional. I was given the contacts of the head of security and the “manager” of front-office, after sticking around the lobby almost all day in order to make sure they do their due diligence and catch an actual thief of an employee inside their own hotel. To cut the story short, I never heard once from the “manager”, and as I tried contacting the head of security, I got rude responses. All in all, the Moxy Hotel only cared about getting their money back and never cared one bit that one our their customers was left with only 4$ because one of their employees wiped him from all his money. I have learned my lesson, and I will never be staying at hotels such as this one, especially after the fact that i had read a review on here that such a theft had also happened last year at the Moxy, and they still did nothing about it. Managing hotels isnt for everyone, and it requires a great deal of responsibility and hospitabilty, and unfortunately Moxy has neither, if I were to advise anyone, stay away from The Moxy and it’s chains.",,mlamaa20,0,2.0

I’ve stayed in many Moxy by Marriott properties, and the newish property close to Times Square fitted the bill. The PGA golf out on Long Island made staying by JFK horrendously expensive, and whilst no NYC property is cheap, the Moxy was comparative to other nearby properties. Add to that Marriott Elite status and a guaranteed late check out, and it was the right choice.I’ve stayed in enough Moxy properties now to know they are funky. I’ve been serenaded at check in, I’ve had decorated rooms, and until this stay, every Moxy room I’d stayed in was identical. This property was different...it had a NYC “loft living” vibe to it. Don’t get my wrong, the rooms are tiny...best suited to single occupancy as the bed is pressed up against the wall. I loved the funky bathroom, and although there is no closet, that aligns with other Moxy properties. Staff I encountered were friendly, and I used a token for a free glass of Prosecco in the Moxy bar area which is convivial, friendly and quite trendy.The sleep I had was the best in a week, so the bed worked. Towels were fluffy and new, and the TV worked well, as did the free WiFi.This review would have a been a “5” but for the horrendous elevators. Firstly they are complicated. Secondly they are slow. If you want to go to floor 8, you don’t simply press “8”...rather you have to use a touchscreen to select your floor, scan you key, and then it tells you which lift to use. There’s no floor level indicator so you don’t know whether you’re in for a 30 second wait or a 5 minute wait. Then you discover that another 30 people are trying to use the same lift, and you don’t fit. The SHORTEST wait I had for a lift was 7 minutes, and bear in mind this property has 4 public elevators. It also has a service lift, and queues were so bad at one stage that a number of guests including me were taken up in the service lift, seeing parts of the hotel I should never really have seen. I spend 150 nights a year or more in hotels. I’ve never come across an elevator system like this. It’s in-necessarily complicated, confusing for guests, and really needs a rethink. It was so bad it would make me think twice about staying here again, even though the rest of the stay was good.Lifts aside, the stay was good.

I had qualms about the Moxie... it clearly targets a young and trendy clientele; I'm not that. Because I'm a Marriott points person, I got upgraded to a corner queen room, that may have made all the difference.The rooms are very basic, with luggage stands and tables that fold and hang on the wall. There is no closet, just hooks and hangers, similarly attached to the wall. The bed was very comfortable. A large sink with shelves sits outside the whimsical bathroom, that includes just a toilet and large shower behind a sliding glass door. The shower is tiled as if it were a swimming pool with warnings about 'no diving.' For one person, the space was perfect for me. Had I shared it with my spouse, we might have been crowded. There was a wall-mounted, large flat-screen TV with cable channels at the foot of the bed, but mounted too low to actually watch in bed.Check-in is designed to be automated, but there are live agents to help. The elevator system takes some getting used to: You select a range of floor possibilities, then the specific floor, then scan your room key, after which you are directed to one of four elevators that has been programmed to go to your floor. People invariably get on the elevator that is not theirs. I saw no one else staying there remotely my age (66), but no worries. The second floor features a large bar area with pool table and such and access to in-hotel restaurants. There is an area where you can select snacks, drinks and light meals (salads and such) to pay for at the bar and take to your room. There is a nightclub of some sort, which did not interest me--HOWEVER the booming music from which echoes throughout the sleeping floors of the hotel until the wee hours on weekends. I am not a light sleeper, but if I were, that would be my primary warning.Other complaints are minor and more directed at the clientele than the hotel itself. It rained during 2 of my 4 days there, and waiting for an uber required one to step out into a bevy of smokers immediately outside the entrance. (As a cancer survivor, I'm amazed young people still smoke so heavily.) One morning went I left my room the hallways on the 12th floor were strewn with empty pizza boxes.

There is no closet in the room, no table, no armchair, so you end up with the floor littered with your possessions and open suitcases.Standards are high in NYC, and we will definitely never be coming back to Moxy!","Paris, France","Alexandra B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",6,2.0

I have given this review one star for its location and the fact that the bed was comfortable.My husband and myself went to USA to celebrate my 50th birthday - a trip that we had saved for for many years. We travelled for more than 12 hours to get to New York and on arrival at The Moxy received no words of welcome or asked how our trip was - instead we were greeted by a young, arrogant man in a bomber jacket, who barely spoke to us as we were checked in. He didn’t tell us anything about the hotel facilities, how to get to the room or why he was putting $100 on my card.When arriving at our room we were gob smacked at the size - it was as wide as a double bed - we would both have to climb in the end of the bed in order to get in! We turned on the air conditioning and it sounded like there was a tractor in the room!! There was no way we would have been able to get any sleep, so we went back to the reception to be greeted by the same man, who eventually (after sending maintenance men to look at the air conditioning and making us feel like we were complaining about nothing) swapped us to another room but advised us that this one would be even smaller!! This room was of similar size but the sink was in the tiny bedroom and not in the bathroom. I knew that hotel rooms in New York are meant to be on the small size but this was just ridiculous.Our main reasons for booking this hotel was for the roof top bar which in the pictures looked amazing. However on visiting this one evening we were made to feel very unwelcome and as if we just did not belong there. This was not the New York hospitality that we received anywhere else. There was one nice young bar man who chatted to us but this was after he checked with his manager if we could be served or not. We felt totally uncomfortable being there and did not visit again, which I think is just what they wanted.This hotel is trying too hard to be hip and trendy and seem to have forgotten how to make their guests feel welcome and to want to return there.What a shame. I would not recommend this hotel - I’m sure there are plenty others that would be a similar price, give you more space and make you feel like there were happy to have you there.New York however was absolutely amazing and the location of the hotel was great for visiting all the tourist attractions.","Leicestershire, United Kingdom","AReveiwer19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicestershire, United Kingdom</strong>",20,1.0

The hotel itself is beautiful and quirky and everything that I would be hoping for but the ""customer service"" that I experienced here was just unbelievable. Long story short, me and my two friends wanted to split the price for a room at check out, I had my credit card on file (in case of emergency) and we all wanted to pay via our pre-paid cards with us being from the UK. I have ended up paying for my third three times over, my friend twice and my other friend was the only one to be charged the correct amount. This left us out of pocked for the rest of our trip to NYC, sent me into my overdraft and now I am paying fees through no fault of my own. We were promised an email to confirm the charges and a receipt of the transaction to provide to our bank, nothing has been done. The gentleman who first dealt with us was rude, refused to answer my questions when I asked why I had been charged (at that point twice) and he lied and said it was pre-authorised. He walked off in a huff when I asked to speak to someone else as at this point I was becoming upset. The manager Victoria did offer us a complimentary lunch which was great, but in no way makes up for me paying three times more than I should have and I am still yet to receive a refund.

I'd have loved to work this out with the hotel directly but as they did not have any interest or customer service skills, I wasn't given a chance. This is not a hotel but an expensive youth hostel. I was booked for a longer stay but changed hotels after few days because I just couldn't take the ""Moxy experience"" anymore. Entrance experience: Deafening music and a bunch of staff standing around in bomber (!?) jackets. They were too busy to look cool to take care of their customers. And what's with the parfym you keep bumping in the air? Thank you also for the wine token, which was promptly taken from my room the next day. The elevators are a nightmare and there are confused people going up and down.The room is tiny, separate shallow sink is not functional. Trying to work is impossible as there is no desk and no chair. The shower only produces lukewarm water so no hot showers then. Your morning breakfast service deal with Egghead sounds very good until you try it. Tried several times and ended up calling them every single morning because of no delivery, late delivery (90 minutes...), wrong delivery. During my numerous calls to staff I spoke with one friendly person. Rest of the calls ended up with them just hanging up the phone. One star for having a handy mini steamer in the room. Apart from that you should really be ashamed of yourselves. I have never encountered such rude and arrogant staff anywhere. As I checked out they tried charging me for 4 water bottles. I was not asked about how my stay was and the person clearly did not have a word please in his vocabulary.

Here's why;The reception team were busy having a giggle with each other to want to check us in.The lifts are a usability nightmare. There are no floor buttons, instead you have to use a touchscreen to select your room, it then tells you which lift to get in. Lifts come and go whilst you wait for yours. As many people were confused by the lifts, they inadvertently enter the wrong one, once it goes there is no way to make it go to the correct floor, so people not staying on our floor were getting off there. There are security issues having people just wandering around floors.The rooms are cramped which I knew before but wow, they are poor. To let some light in the room doors have a window, unfortunately this shone light on to the pillows on the bed next to the door. I had to sleep the opposite way to get some sleep.The room had not been cleaned properly, the floor was filthy with dust flying around, hairs on the floor and orbees (little water soaking balls, mostly childrens toys) on the floor. As we left the next morning the cleaner was outside our room so I asked her to give the floor a vacuum, she didn't. There are no chairs in the rooms, you are expected to sit on the bed which is back breaking.The shower divider does not do it's job, resulting in flooding the bathroom each time you shower.Excessive music playing until midnight, don't expect to have an early nightThe reception team were as vacant on checkout as check-in.To save the hotel, the communal areas are pleasant to spend some time in.I expected the rooms to be small in this location, but the cleanliness was awful. We were only here for 2 nights and my experiences with the reception team left me with little confidence that any comments would have been sorted so just put up with it until our next hotel.","Derbyshire, United Kingdom","DCandell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Derbyshire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,2.0

I have travelled across the country and Europe many times. I did find these rooms smaller than I was accustomed to. I also have read all the previous reviews from others who have stayed at this Moxy. Those reviews made me think twice about reserving there. My 26 yr old son was home on Leave from the service and we wanted to do something he would enjoy. Moxy advertised as millennium oriented. So I took a chance and booked the rooms. Again I read all the reviews and had worries. Our first contact was about 1:30 in the afternoon when we brought our luggage in to store so we could wander the city. The young woman was friendly and when i asked for rooms in a quiet part of the hotel she immediately reserved rooms on the 6th floor saying it was very quiet there. It was! We enjoyed our afternoon, came back and checked into an exceptionally clean room that could be described as others noted as pretty small. We live in a large, but minimalist style home so we found the minimalist style of the room just fine. It is simple in design and is small in sq footage but yet suited our needs. We only plan to shower and sleep there in reality. We had enough room to open two suitcases (queen room) on stands without difficulty. Yes there are no closets but plenty of hooks to hang w hangers and under the bed cubbies. The bathroom does not provide the privacy that others might prefer with a glass “barn door” separating the room. Yes, the sink is outside the bathroom just around the corner. We did not see it a problem. The shower is awesome and the beds very comfortable along with four pillows. I crammed my husbands pillow in my suitcase after reading that the pillows were not great. I found them fine. The tv is close to the foot of the bed and one side of the bed was up against the wall. Not a big deal as I already read about this In the reviews. We enjoyed our free champagne on the 2nd floor and explored both lounge/restaurant areas. We found them expensive to eat and drink at but found them inviting and had friendly staff. We later chose to eat elsewhere nearby and found prices more reasonable. Overall we would definitely stay here again. It is important to read reviews but at the same time we are not all the same in our lifestyles and we must take that into consideration when choosing lodging and restaurants. Much of the previous reviews made me aware of what the accommodations were like but we found it comfortable and staff very accommodating when asked questions. This is clearly not the traditional Marriott that we are all accustomed to but it is not intended to be that. It really does depend on how much personal space you need and how much of your day is going to be spent in the room.

At check-in, it was clear this place is different; reception wasn’t stationed at a desk, but rather the one staffer was out in the lobby talking to people in an almost aggressively friendly way. It was confusing, but fine.The room floors are stylishly spare - small spaces and limited amenities (no coffeemaker, no mini-fridge, no closet, etc) but done in a thoughtfully designed way. I like the portable table and chair that you can pull off the wall hook and use, or leave hanging out of the way, for example.There is a clear attempt for a communal vibe, but the downside is that convenience and ease of use doesn’t seem to be a big priority. This may be frustrating to business travelers or those with loyalty status who are accustomed to more traditional amenities and services. For example, last night, I wanted ice and couldn’t find it. There was nothing on the single info sheet, so I called guest services and learned I would have to take an elevator downstairs. The problem being the elevators are slow and buggy. So I gave up and skipped the ice - not worth the effort. I get their thinking here, and it was just a minor annoyance. But all the little things start to add up. Where they lost me was this morning. I had limited time for breakfast before a conference call, so I went down to the second floor to grab a quick bite. What I found was a confusing and chaotic amalgam of different seating areas, with lots of lounge-y sofas and chairs. I wandered the floor for several minutes trying to decipher it all. There was no clear signage, no host, no obvious breakfast menu, no waitlist and virtually no available seating. The full restaurant was apparently not open, so people were eating in the bar/lounge/coffeehouse hybrid space. A grab-and-go snack area was unattended - even if I wanted to grab a juice, there seemed to be no say to pay; a small menu board listed oatmeal, but again nobody in sight and no way to order, even to take away. The couple of servers I saw elsewhere looked overwhelmed and unhelpful. There was a quirky ice cream vending machine and a table with free coffee, but that was the extent of my self-service options. It was quite evident I wouldn’t be able to sit, get service and sat in a reasonable amount of time, so I left. It’s worth noting that an egg sandwich I spied in passing looked delicious.

Slept well both nights that I was there, which is my number one requirement in a hotel, and hard to achieve this near to Times Square. I started the review with ""personally"" because the unique style of the rooms is a good fit for my personality, and I stayed there alone, so that was just fine. The staff were very helpful, and more efficient than the laid-back style might suggest. The common area on the second floor is one of the best lobby concepts I've encountered anywhere.I would give the Moxy NYC five stars if I thought everyone would enjoy the same style - but I doubt this is the case. The Moxy goes all in on its minimalist style and some folks will want more room - like more square footage (I'm not even sure if my wife would like staying in the room I had - the person sleeping next to the window has to to climb over the other person to get out of bed). Just how different this place is was a bit of a shock when I arrived, so the Moxy might do better at setting expectations. But when I realized my room had all the amenities that I needed, including a cleverly hidden safe, I relaxed and went with the vibe. I was able to rest there, work there, show up for a meeting at Nasdaq looking sharp, then relax in the evening. As long as the rates stay reasonable and service level remain high, I recommend it to the seasoned traveler who wants the basics done right: rest, relaxation, and a solid base from which to ramble.","Coventry, United Kingdom","zcobb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coventry, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

I've been to so many Marriott/Starwood properties, being Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Member, and this is certainly one of the worst. Pretty insulting experience in dorm like surroundings, The good thing is that I used my points to book 1 night in Moxy, otherwise I would ask for my money back, no joke intended. I do understand that it is focused on millennials market, and it is New York, but it still blows my mind when you get to stay in dorm like room tiny room for $400 or so! Well, I also stayed 1 night in 5 star Sofitel right before Moxy, and what a contrast! BTW, the price point is very similar, and Moxy is even more expensive at times. Indifferent front staff providing indifferent experience at check-in. Was refused upgrade with a shrug, and was given $10 casino style token to spend in a bar (really?!). Asked for quiet room, and was given room on the 8th floor, that was nothing but quiet due to street noise and lack of insulation. Room was beyond tiny, even by NY standards. No space at all, nowhere to work, no desk or table, nowhere to put the luggage and personal belongings. To add insult, there is ancient air conditioner that is as noisy as the old car with broken muffler! Had to turn it off, so I could sleep. Rooftop bar: very expensive Sidecar, and remarkably slow service. Now, to the worst part: checkout! I told them that I was unhappy with my stay, and met with indifferent shrug. Asked to remove totally ridiculous $10 charge for 2 small cartons of water. They asked ""why""? Because I refuse to pay for bottled water in hotels, and it was first time in many years, when I was charged for eater in Marriott property. They said that only tap iced water is free, had a nerve. To be objective, they removed the charge, and their Manager called me back, and gave me back some points foolishly spent on this reservation. Ok, enough said, stay away: there are tons of better and less expensive properties in Midtown Manhattan.

The other bar is a pit on the second floor with shabby wore out furnishings and and a foos ball table with noise that racks your brain. BTW, the food is marginal even by Time Square standards. Gratuities and requests for housekeeping attention resulted in money gone, services not provided. And the tiny sink in our suite drained approx 20 minutes after use.

Upon checkout, we checked the folio and noticed we were charged $10 for water. We didn’t drink the water. We didn’t even touch it. When I questioned this, the girl asked, “Did you move the cartons or open them a little?” No, we did not. I then asked - if housekeeping hadn’t even been to our room - how could this mistake occur? The girl actually said that they ASSUME people are going to drink the water, so they charge the bill. What? That is unbelievable and unacceptable. Maybe it’s because there is no sign on the water or prices. Maybe they assume people will think it’s free and drink it, and so they charge them? So, get your receipt when you check out and check it twice! PROS: Comfortable pillows. Clean room. Cool and trendy use of space. Amazing shower. Good location. CONS: The guy who checked us in was extremely cold and disinterested - basically rude. The room is so tiny that you have to jump or dive into the bed. No coffeemaker. No free bottles of water.

The whole hotel has a very modern vibe with loud music playing from reception to the lifts. (and can be heard from some rooms apparently!) Rooms are tiny, I actually rolled over in bed one night and hit the light switch, no wardrobe and had to live out of suitcase with only hooks on the wall to hang anything and no tea/coffee facilities but you don’t spend a lot of time in the rooms for this to matter. There were two cartons of water which we were charged $5 dollars each for-not complimentary. The room was immaculately clean, maid service daily with clean towels and the bed was very comfy with good quality sheets etc. Shower was good but we had to direct it against the wall as it flooded the bathroom first time we used it. The sink didn’t drain at all well. The bar on 2 was expensive but being where we were situated it was prob inline with other places and we enjoyed our free glass of Prosecco while sitting and able to chat. The rooftop bar seemed quite hip-with all of us approaching 50 we walked in-turned around and walked out again-very loud and dark (had to use our phones to light up the menu!) but obviously a great place if you like that sort of thing! We never ate at the hotel but had breakfast at Applebees (a few roads up 42nd?!?) a couple of mornings after trying a few dodgy places. It was nice to be waited on and eat a nice hot full plate of food and not out of plastic cartons or buffet style but again that’s our preference.

You'd never guess you were in Times Square because it has major hip downtown NYC vibes, which you'll immediately feel on entrance via the lively lobby. Impeccable, quick check-in, by the way. Everyone's very helpful and friendly. The room is great, which I'll get to, but I also spent a lot of time at the super stylish Bar Moxy and the rooftop bar and lounge, which apparently is the largest indoor/outdoor rooftop bar in all of NYC. Views of the Empire State Building and the carousel (!!) = very Instagram-friendly. I also loved LEGASEA, their posh (but non-pretentious) seafood restaurant. Really yum. I could go on and on... In short, the vibe of Moxy NYC Times Sq is uniquely NYC. Hip and fun, yet also somehow kid-friendly. It's an experience hotel. A total gem. As for my room? It was great! Nice city views and flooded with natural light. I love the minimal yet very creative decor. Especially the cute collapsable table. The stars of the room for me?

Especially the way that I’m treated at the W Hotel in Fort Lauderdale. Extremely professional there. The Moxy is the latest brand launched by Marriott more designed for the millennials. Unfortunately I am not a millennial so my 3 night stay was not a positive experience. When I checked in, not only did they not thank me for being a titanium elite but some of the staff was playing Nerf basketball in the lobby. Which I guess is a Marketing technique. If a guest get a basket they get something. It just did not come across as very professional. I specifically asked for a room with some type of view and a king bed. When I got to my room, as small as it was it had no closet and only hooks on the wall, I was in an alley facing a building with four women on a computer about 10 feet away in an office as they looked at me when I entered my room. I went downstairs and they were able to give me another room however on the fourth floor no king and no view. Just a little claustrophobic feeling. The rooms do not have any ironing board or irons. They did however bring up an iron and a board that was probably about 3 feet long. The sink was on the outside of the bathroom and took a while for any hot water to appear. I did like the shower though. I had asked for extra pillows and after four hours, I did not receive them and talked to the manager. He was very kind and retrieved the pillows himself and gave me extra points. The room reminded me of a mixture of hi-end dorm crossing over to a youth hostel. For $265/night I would expect more. I really think the staff needs to be educated and oriented about guest services and how to treat a customer, especially an elite customer. So if you are 21, perhaps this is the place for you.

Staff are easy going, friendly, nice, and service minded. The decor, design, architecture all felt good and modern. Nevertheless, we did not like the bathroom doors, as they are transparent, which might not be ideal for a multi-generation family or a group of friends, as it really affects the bathroom privacy. Other than that, we enjoyed the hotel a lot. Rooms are small, but functional and well designed to make the best out of the small space. Beds were comfy but the pillow was thin and no second pillow available. Plenty of USB portals. Guests under the age of 18 were not allowed to access to roof-terrace, not even for taking a photo. The location of the hotel is superb, easy access for shopping, sightseeing and dining.

For starters, our check-in experience was super easy, as the hotel staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The modern look and feel of the lobby was a nice touch and a fun vibe - especially in contrast to the hustle & bustle of Midtown. On that note, getting to the hotel was super convenient by train and the area was surprisingly quiet, given its proximity to Times Square / Penn Station.I really enjoyed the room design - especially the huge bathroom. The amazing rainfall shower were exactly the touch I was looking for on my staycation. Wish I had one at home! The room's layout was cozy & efficient, which I didn't mind as the bedroom area was just as large as the bathroom. One downside is that I would've liked a guest robe in the room.My favorite part was definitely the hotel's many bar and restaurant spaces. Magic Hour (rooftop bar) was so much fun (love the amusement-style decor) and the food / drinks selection were perfect for grabbing drinks with friends. Even better was grabbing breakfast sandwiches at Egghead the following morning. Honestly the food options were so good, that I'd definitely return while in the area.","New York City, New York","lijlife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,5.0

My husband phoned reception who said we were in a quiet room, I hate to think what the other rooms were like. I understand vibe the hotel was trying to achieve but it was a bit on the cringe side and on the whole we thought the staff (reception) acted unprofessional. The rooms were ridiculously small, we had nowhere to put our smallish cases, had to hang our clothes on pegs and had to climb over my husband to get into bed. The location is perfect for times square/madison square gardens but that would not be enough for me to stay there again. I await the ridiculous response from the management trying to justify anything in this hotel. Going by other reviews I'm sure they'll just roll their eyes and crack on.","Leicester, England, United Kingdom","bettsy4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicester, England, United Kingdom</strong>",35,1.0

And I would not hesitate to stay here again. It's clean, convenient, comfortable. There's a good gym and it was reasonably priced. They even put balloons in my room for being a Marriott reward member. I then spent the rest of my stay kicking balloons out of my way -- a bottle of beer would've been a much better token of appreciation.I was on business so I found the lack of a real desk or chair annoying. Later on the TV I noticed some kind of folding table that comes in some of the rooms and is meant to be a desk I guess. My room did not have that.I also appreciate an iron/ironing board in my hotel room. The hand held steamer was no match for the wrinkles my roll aboard bag generates.The shower was in a wide open corner of the bathroom. Even being in the room 100% by myself ... showering had a really weird vibe. It was like being in a high school locker room.And some of the small touches are needlessly silly.

I knew there would be 4 women going. I debated on what rooms to get but then came across the bunk bed room at the Moxy Times Square. I read some reviews, and it was clear this hotel was aimed at a certain age group. I, however, am not too old to like the idea of certain amenities not typical at some other hotels.(usb charging ports, shampoo dispensers with good shampoo and conditioner, personal spot lights, Netflix enabled TVs...etc). In the reviews, many other patrons complained about the bar being too loud, the size of the room, and how the desk people didn’t fawn over them because they are “important Marriott customers”. On the not receiving super duper special help from the staff at check in. What exactly is it that they expect? I received all of the help I needed, they were not rude and even walked me to the elevator explaining how all of the controls are outside of the elevator . They gave me a run down on restaurants and bars located onsite, including what entrance to use at what time. I didn’t really hear the bar loud enough to prevent me from falling asleep, I was on the 16th floor. I found it to be a great utilization of space especially when only there for a long weekend. Who really needs closets and chest of drawers for short stays! I loved how the tables and chairs fold up and hang from the wall, how there is a steamer not an iron in the room (however an ironing board and iron were available to me in the “stash closet” located behind the elevator on each floor), and that the shampoo and conditioner were high quality Muk brand. We received free drink tokens upon check in, free water in the room, and coupons to eat at the restaurants onsite as well as suggestions for the best area activities. The location of this hotel is centralized, close to just about anywhere you would want to go in midtown. We got there at 1pm so our room was not ready. They allowed us to check in our luggage in and store them on the lower level to go get some lunch and look around. I then received a text message telling us when the room was ready. 4 ladies lived 4 days in one of the bunk bed rooms. We loved it and did not find it cramped at all. The only complaints I have about this room are that the water didn’t get all that hot in the shower, and the you could see just a little though the frosted glass in the shower/ bathroom. Other than those minuscule things it was perfect and I will absolutely stay there again!","Dothan, Alabama","nicolehollowaybe2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dothan, Alabama</strong>",1,5.0

Well this time the experience was not the same. We were back in the city this time for my wife and daughter to run the NYC Half Marithon, we arrived early and the room was not ready so we stored our luggage and went out into the city. Upon our return at 3pm the room was still not ready, knowing the rooms are not guaranteed until 4pm we went upstairs to have a drink. Soon after the young lady from the desk came to find us to let us know the room was ready, wow, that was sincerely nice of her as she did not have to do that. I wish I had her name to thank her. This is where the hospitality began and ended on our visit.We went to our room and decided to take a little nap before dinner. At about 430pm we heard a tap-tap-tap. And immediately, without any announcement our door opens and a maid walks into the room, sees us she turned and rushes out and away from our room. We followed and asked her what she wanted and all she would say was sorry and continued on her escape from our sight. So as we left for our dinner reservation, I stopped at the front desk area and spoke to Michael Hilsdorf, who presented me with his card and that was when I found out that he was the Assistant Operations Manager. I thought at that point I was in capable hands and my complaint would be addressed promptly. As a person that works in the hospitality industry, I understand the importance of responding to guests needs immediately (typically that means within 20 minutes). I told Michael we were going to dinner and I would like an answer to why a maid let herself into my occupied room by the time we returned from our dinner. Upon our return, Michael still had no answer. I told him we were going to our room to bed and to please email me his findings at that point. Well here we are 24 hours after the fact and still no call or email. I should add here that I did ask for him or another manager this morning, but I was told that no one was available to talk/assist. Exception, the young man at the desk did offer a 50.00 rebate as we pre paid our room. I received the rebate but it had a deduction for 5.44 for water, which we did not purchase, so I called to see why I was charged for water that I did not purchase. The man I spoke with at the extension for “folios” told me he could not help with a disputed charge and I would have to call on Monday. Again, so much for responding to guest needs immediately. Well the four reservations I planned on making for the next four races in NYC will not be made at Moxy because if they can’t address or fix the small things, how can I expect them to fix the big things when/if they happen.",,Shawn C,4,2.0

The photos show a funky room, yet small but looked fresh and clean. Check-in was easy, but when I got into the room, it was smaller than I expected, not a big deal since I was just there for a night. The layout of my room (Double) Had the bed between 2 walls, so you have to climb into it from the bottom. Also the sink is separate from the rest of the bathroom, so if you don't like that, be aware. Decent amount of plugs but space is limited, especially if you want to setup the desk (whcih is a foldup that hangs on the wall). Other than a few cubbies for clothes under bed, there is no other storage in this room, though there was a safe, which was nice. Overall, if you are a business traveler, the size probably won't bother you, families or people international with bags, YMMV.I had a particular issue during my stay. Because of the location and the price, I have a feeling the typical customers are on the younger party side (also pretty clear based on the asthetic). From about midnight to 5 AM, one of my neighbors who was far too under the influence, was making a ton of noise, banging on walls, screaming, being calmed down by friends. I called guest services and notified them, was told it would be handlded, but it was not. So all in all, not a great night's sleep. I would probably not stay again because I am more comfortable with a little more space and would rather stay in a road-warrior style hotel than one for tourists. I would reccommend it however based on what you are looking for.","Norwalk, Connecticut","isaaclevin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwalk, Connecticut</strong>",10,3.0

The predominant issue with the room was the NOISE. There is a rooftop bar on top of the hotel, and as we were aware of this we requested a quiet room. However we were given a room on the 12th floor (out of 17) and the noise at night was unreal. Unfortunately we arrived after a long flight on Saturday afternoon and the loud bass music went on that night until 4am. Call me crazy, but I expect to be able to sleep in a hotel! When my friend went down to complain the staff were dismissive and rude. We were told we ""shouldn't be able to hear the noise"" from our floor. Well then why were we down there complaining? You could hear the music from street level. I had silicone earplugs with me and they didn't make a jot of difference. To be fair to the Moxy, the other nights the music didn't go on as late (maybe til 11pm/12am) but to me that is still too late for a hotel.We also requested late check-out, but someone came to our room to ask us if we were leaving before our check-out time. I said we had late check out and the staff member said ""....Was it approved?"". Oh no it wasn't, I just decided to stay anyway! Of course it had been. I didn't like the staff in this hotel's attitude to guests.The lifts at this hotel are difficult to use. You are supposed to select your floor, swipe your card over a reader then it will direct you to which lift you should take. However, often when you pressed the screen another random floor was selected so you had to be careful paying attention to make sure the lift would actually go to your floor. Sometimes it took quite a few swipes to get it to recognise your card as well. Pretty inefficient system.The whole vibe of the hotel I found a bit cringey to be honest. They are trying very hard to go for a young, cool vibe. Loud music blaring in the lobby, neon everywhere, no front desk in the lobby. Not my cup of tea but that's not really the hotel's fault.Other issues I had with the hotel were based on the room itself. The room was extremely small, which we were expecting so that wasn't too much of a problem. However the door to the toilet was transparent, which in a small room being shared with friends was extremely awkward!! The other problem was that the mirrors were placed directly beneath lights so it cast a shadow over you, making it very hard to apply makeup.To provide a bit of balance to this review, there were a few aspects I liked about this hotel. The location is really excellent. You are so close to loads of sights and subway stations so it is easy to get around. Also the shower was amazing! The water pressure was really good, definitely the best shower I've ever used.Sadly, these plus points are not enough to save this hotel for me and I won't be back!","Glasgow, United Kingdom","amyst19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",3,1.0

Beds pressed up against the wall and you both have to climb on the side of the bed to get in, really strange and feel sorry for the maids who have to change hundreds of bed sheets! Shower is good! The staff are a mixed bag, some are friendly and others just seem to be too into having a laugh with each other to notice you.

I have stayed in this part of NY a number of times and never had a more uncomfortable room. This place tries to be cute with lots of European flare but I have been to Europe -- I don't need a trip to Disney for my hotel stay. No real chair, no closet, no drawers, no clock, no place to work if you need to do something. Then there are the elevators that work so poorly they station a person in the lobby to help people use them. The sink is literally smaller than a dishpan with no place to put a razor (no place for a woman to get ready). The bathroom light is behind you so you cast a shower in the mirror. They do provide a vanity mirror...it precludes you from washing your face as it blocks the sink. Their cute shower door leaks water all over the floor. This a new hotel but the towels were scratchy? I have stayed at 5 other Marriott properties in the area, regardless of price (several were less $), they all provide basic hotel services and comfort. I wanted to be sure I was not being too harsh so I asked a co-worker and a stranger (who was grateful for my elevator tutorial).

Admittedly, hotels in NYC are not cheap, so I did a lot of searching before finding Moxy NYC. The price was the initial attraction, at $150 a night, it was cheap for New York. Then realising how close it was to Times Sq, I booked immediately. Located on the corner of 36th St and 7th Av, it was spot on. A few blocks north of Madison Sq Gdns and a few south of Times Sq with Penn Station 2 blocks away. It was a fluke I chose a hotel so close to the subway station and it was perfect for connecting to other lines and it is also the hub for the LIRR, so excellent if you want to travel to/from the airport. Taxis are $52 flat rate plus tip, however you can get the Airtrain for $5 and then LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) for $10 so a much cheaper option. I would do this every time, plus it is probably quicker considering how bad the traffic in the city can be.The hotel is very trendy, has a great atmosphere and suits all ages. They don't have a bell boy so you do have to take your own bags to the room but this saves on that awkward tipping when you first arrive. I also didn't notice a concierge, but all staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms are quite small but this is standard in New York, however they have everything you need; hairdryer, safety deposit, steamer, amenities, satellite tv with Netflix. No wardrobes, but plenty of hooks to hang clothes up. I was travelling with my brother so had a queen bed plus single bunk bed. Beds were comfy with plenty pillows. The bathroom was great and the shower was unreal - so powerful I could have stayed there all day.Didn't go to the bar or eat in the restaurant, prices way too expensive which again, is typical for hotel bars.

The egg place (sort of in the hotel) on 7th was quick and very good. The hotel is new and in very good shape. I thought there would be more noise being on 7th Ave but it was pretty quiet in the room. The elevator system requires you to be a guest in the hotel with a key to get to the rooms and it felt secure.

Obviously, I continue to come back to this hotel, mostly because of it's location to transit hubs in Midtown and because the rooms, in my opinion, are thoughtfully designed to store and stash all your belongings in a smaller space. Also, on average, it's a great price for the neighborhood. I enjoy the bar, the breakfast shop, the fun games in the lobby and planned activities. Did I mention hipster mac and cheese? It's all designed to appeal to a younger audience, for sure. I also enjoy the access to the huge, hip rooftop club... EXCEPT when I'm trying to sleep. When I book the smaller rooms, it will sound like the DJ is spinning their tunes directly in the room. (I did book a larger room during my second stay, and barely heard anything). No amount of ear plugs, white noise turned up to 11, and pillows over my head could drown out the din completely. This doesn't bother me when I'm out late in the city partying myself, but if for some reason you need to sleep during your trip before 2 am, like my latest excursion to the city, ask for a quiet room, if possible. Everything else is great, and it's why I keep coming back. I like this fresh concept from Marriott, and it's location, so I recommend.","Singapore, Singapore","JEP7282</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",9,4.0

Original reservation was at Moxy Chelsea and you can read about that debacle, but my wife, daughter, and some friends ended up at this Moxy and it did not get much better. As it was relayed to me, service really isn't their speciality at the Moxy. After being walked from the Chelsea property, along with a bunch of other people, the staff didn't exactly put in the effort to get people in to their rooms. They finally got in to the rooms at close to 5P when they were told they would be checked in at 4P. The front desk, with the exception of the manager, Mike, was completely unresponsive to their needs. In fact, seems like Mike is the only one that gives a rip.Rooms are interesting and the connected restaurant is good, but they really aren't good at hospitality.","Sellersville, Pennsylvania","Bob P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sellersville, Pennsylvania</strong>",8,2.0

First impressions were like this is a modern, cool hotel, however as we got into our room on the 16th floor we began running into problems, I was aware of there being a nightclub on the top floor, what I was not aware of however is that the effort to soundproof is non existant.We were moved to the 6th floor and still nothing but a wall of noise and music until 4am, dont get me wrong Sean Pauls Get Busy is a perfectly adequate song but come 3:30am on the third night with it blaring it becomes somewhat draining when you are be looking to be up early. Now onto the room, again really nice facilities shower is great as is the sink and decor, the heating/aircon system sounds like a generator and is incredibly loud (not loud enough to drown out the music mind) The choices of temperature Frozen Tundra or Molten Lava. The only other quibble was one of the power points in 618 is very dodgy and you cannot get your plug out once you have put it in. Now the staff. I will discount one handyman who came up to help me when I dropped my phone down the side of the bed, he was very helpful and courteous, however downstairs in reception....... not so much. The nightclub vibe carries through into the Foyer and when we were trying to book our transport back via a group bus we had to repeat this three times, the lady then mentioned she would do this, I didnt feel the most confident she had and when I asked her colleague a couple of hours later he said there was no booking, he then proceeded to say well its not my fault!! I then contacted them myself and as I had not left enough time they were unable to book it so I had to get a cab to JFK so lost out on $60.If sleep deprivation and staff caring more that they look cool and aloof as opposed to professional and keen to help then this is your place! They will come back and say that they are working to improve the soundproofing but going by previous reviews maybe the only resolutions is in room earbuds!","Tring, United Kingdom","TomLeathers1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tring, United Kingdom</strong>",3,1.0

We checked in late a night but found if very easy to do so with the self check in desks. The lift was a little confusing at first as I have never seen anything like that in other hotels, however, after the first use it was simple. We loved our room, yes the rooms are a little small but it was fine for the two of us. The only issue we had was we had a superior queen room and there was a double bed above our queen, we would occasionally hit our heads - this was our fault as when we booked it we chose this option. Just be warned to check what you've booked. The location of this hotel is perfect!... its round the corner from times square,the empire state and pretty much all other tourist attractions.. wonderful! We were on the top floor and never had any disturbance from the rooftop bar. The wifi at the hotel is excellent, really fast and super easy to connect to. The only issue we had was where the plug socket were placed for the hairdryer.. no matter which one I plugged it into it would not reach the mirror so I had to dry my hair without a mirror all week - annoying but not the worst thing. Another thing is the sliding bathroom door, there are gaps when you shut it so using the bathroom isnt as private as one would hope - this is the one thing I would change, having a door that fully shuts in the bathroom!

The hotel follows a trend to provide smaller and smaller rooms with fewer and fewer amenities in trade for less expensive room rates and masking that with a high design feel and claiming to be modern. The first thing you notice when you enter the hotel room is the sink. It may seem strange that this is the first thing you notice, but it is unavoidable, because the bathroom sink is in the entrance hallway. Why? So that the “bathroom” itself can be the just the width of the shower / toilet. Together, the entrance hallway and the bathroom, are also the width of the hotel room which means the bedroom measures about 8.5’ x 8.5’. The entire hotel room is so small in fact that there are no closets or drawers to put clothes in. Closet and drawers have been replaced with a Quakers inspired rail of pegs that spans the length of the room, on which there are exactly three hangers. Another heavier coat hanger is also provided but for some reason a design choice was that this hanger is not removable from its peg. Note that not all these pegs are really usable, since the pegs are also used to hang the body length mirror, and to store the room’s table and extra chair. More pegs are made unusable as they are over the space that the television occupies. Additional storage is, at first glance, located under the bed. However, of the four spaces provided there, the largest is for a suitcase (please feel free to move the night stand out of the way first), and the second space is the hotel room’s single drawer. Opening that drawer reveals that it is already occupied by the room safe. This leaves two cubbyholes, large enough each for a dress shirt.Staying with the bed for a minute, it is pushed into a corner of the room, right up against the outside wall with the prison-like slit windows. There is less than a foot between the end of the bed and the wall where the TV is installed, so standing there means your knees touch the bed and your back touches the TV. If you are unfortunate enough to have booked this room and are a couple, the person sleeping next to the window will need to climb over their bedmate to get out of bed, which is made more likely since that same person is likely to roll over and be rudely awakened by the very cold, hard outside wall. That person is also subjected to the heat or cold from the HVAC unit right at their feet, which is rather loud but mostly drowns out the noise of traffic coming through the poorly sound attenuated slit windows. Even on the fifth floor of the hotel, it was surprisingly noisy.There is also a fairly long list of things you won’t have when staying in this room. You won’t have any carpet in the room, so be prepared for cold floors. You won’t have an iron to iron clothes. That has been replaced by a handheld steamer, since an iron would have required an ironing board which would have taken up more valuable peg space. You won’t have a fridge or minibar in the room. You won’t have much privacy if you decide to take a shower (naturally, there is no bath as it would have been too big) and your partner decides to use the toilet, as there is no shower curtain and will likely get sprayed as the shower faces the toilet. The space is small enough and the designers conscious enough of that fact that extra small tiles are used to make the space seem bigger. You won’t have separate bath gel and shampoo, as that has been combined into a single bottle. You also won’t be able to really use the sink. The sink is shallower than a roasting pan, and has no stopper to fill with water. The tap itself is designed to be low pressure and have a spread out water flow rather than a normal column of water to prevent splashing from this shallow sink. You won’t have an easy time using the desk, which is hung on the wall. To use it you need to take it down and try to set it up, but it more often than not is persnickety in the exact position it needs to be to gain enough traction to have its legs unfold. Trying to set up one handed is futile as it just flops around. You won’t be able to read in bed if your partner turns off their light, as that is also the master light switch which turns off all the lights, rather than leaving the bedside lights individually controlled like in most hotels. Check in and check out are self serve with a couple of folks there that assist you if you have trouble. However, most people seem to have trouble, and the line to ask those folks a question is long. The drinks in the bar are about $19 per drink after tax and tip, which seems pretty steep, especially for not top of the shelf alcohol. There are some things that are nice about the hotel room. There are plentiful outlets, most with two USB ports to allow charging of devices. The TV is equipped with Google Chromecast, and also is a smart TV that allows you to sign in to your favorite media streaming service, such as Netflix. That sink that is in the your room’s entrance hallway has a lovely blue gray hue and textured porcelain finish. At the end of the day, nothing here really stands up to scrutiny. The switches on the walls are installed haphazardly. The security peep hole in the door is installed crooked so that the cover for it constantly leaves the eye hole open. The drapes covering the room’s front door’s industrial wired and frosted glass window are held up by velcro and not the toggle buckles they seem to be. And the art on your wall that seems whimsical at first with its toy wrestler turns out to be someone violent and scary with a woman bent over showing her bottom, and what can only be described as clouds of flatulence talking about drugs. None of the things are individually so terrible as to make a stay at the Moxy undesirable, but as a conglomeration, they add up to a feeling of hostility, as if the hotel just wants do the very minimal possible. If you are a hip person that values appearance over practical functionality, this is definitely the hotel for you.","Staten Island, New York","Grufnik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staten Island, New York</strong>",56,3.0

On arrival I handed over my credit card in case of damages etc as you do. When I arrived home I had a nasty surprise. I had a debit on my card even though I had not used it once. I emailed the hotel to ask what it was for and they told me it was a bar bill. I told them I had not used my card and this was a mistake. They said they would send me an invoice which after about 10 emails they did. It just said bar bill. I told them this must be a mistake as I had not used my card but since then they have ignored my many emails. I have now contacted the head office who are equally as useless. Told me they would have someone senior look into it but days later still no response. Don't like giving bad reviews but this is just theft what they have done and as for the terrible customer service. It is now in the hands of my credit card company. Avoid handing your card over is all I can suggest. Tell them you don't have one. I have never ever had a problem like this as a frequent visitor to the US. And another thing don't expect to be checked in on arrival. Do it yourself!!!

I have to be honest in saying that was I super disappointed with this hotel. Upon reading reviews prior to booking, I understood that the rooms were extremely small, however extremely small is an understatement. Upon arriving at the hotel there are around 10 self-serve screens that allow for you to check in and check out for yourself. There is also around 4 staff members standing in a corner doing nothing, so doesn’t really make sense? I approached one of them as I wanted to upgrade our room, and they were so incredibly rude - you could tell the staff hated their jobs which ruins the overall experience for the customer. The lady who reluctantly helped us stated that we could upgrade our room for an extra amount per night which we agreed to - now I regret this as the room wasn’t even slightly bigger than the original room we booked. We overlooked this as we were in New York and hardly spent time in the hotel room. On the second night however, I was woken up at around 3am by a PIERCING noise which ended up being the fire alarm. This was VERY scary and there is NO WHERE in the room that explains what to do if the alarm goes off. There was a gentlemen over the intercom, however, he seemed very scared and no one was picking up the front desk phone - I tried calling multiple times. I left our room to see other people standing outside in the hallway unsure what to do as well. Thank god it was a false alarm which I confirmed later with one of the staff members who stated it was steam in the electronics? I also read online that this had happened to multiple people whilst staying at this hotel. I have to say that the location of the hotel is very good, we were within walking distance to Times Square which was helpful for the short time we were in New York - had we had longer and were over 21 I would have stayed near Central Park - much more classy. A few people had also complained about the noise from the rooftop bar, however, we were on the 15th floor and had no issues falling asleep. The hotel also has a candy bar and free hot chocolate - some days there were no cups for the hot chocolate, and the candies at the bar were terrible, so maybe that could be improved. The tv, shower and bed are pretty good in the room, however, the tap does not release clean clear water, it’s murky off-white water which confused me a little. I would never stay here again but the hotel does deserve an average as it was just that, average, maybe borderline poor.

Naturally at 6:30 pm there was not an empty seat to be had nor anytime soon.The restaurant bar was also completely full.The roof-top bar was also reserved for several special events.Seems one of the primary reasons one would choose to come to this hotel would be for the convenience of not having to go out after work to find a drink. Certainly not for the cozy (see above) rooms.I am a lifetime platinum Marriott rewards member and stay in Manhattan 3 nights a week, I will take my loyalty elsewhere. Time for Marriott to rethink this relationship!Go somewhere where you will get a lot more for your money and know you will have to go out for a drink rather than the pretense of having a bar for your customers.","North Blenheim, New York","ronhF4381SL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Blenheim, New York</strong>",11,1.0

After reading the reviews I wasn't sure we were cool enough for this hotel! I love a party as much as the next person but I also love a comfortable slice of luxury on which to rest my head at the end of the day too - I was worried that it had been previously described as a posh hostel!Well, it's true the Moxy lobby does smell lovely when you walk in. However, we failed the self-serve check-in so had to enlist the help of the lovely staff (in our defense, after travelling for 15 hours we were not functioning properly and the lobby is very dark!) We were allocated an inward facing room on the 17th floor (1703 directly below the rooftop nightclub). Once we'd got to grips with how the (also dark) lifts work (tell the lift where you want to go before you get in!) we were away.The bedroom was bigger than I was expecting, having read previous reviews - the style was minimalist Scandinavian we thought! Very clean and functional. The shower room was also a good size, although we didn't like the see-through frosted glass door between the bedroom and the shower room - no-one wants to see that at our age!! The view out of our window was of the other internal windows in a small square shape so if you had the blinds open, everyone could see straight into your room. Did feel a bit exposed if I'm honest and claustrophobic with the blinds closed. I had a cold and struggled to sleep during our stay so actually welcomed the distraction of the throbbing club music booming into our room until 4am. We only ventured onto the rooftop bar once - it was interesting. The revolving seating was fun, very dark overall again, not sure when the crazy golf would get used? LOL! We only had access to half the venue as there was a private party occupying the other half which was a shame. Lovely view from the rooftop balcony overlooking the Empire State Building!We had breakfast on the 2nd floor Moxy Bar area. Surprisingly and in contrast to the rest of the hotel, it's light, bright and airy - loft style décor. Breakfast was lovely, Hubby had breakfast slider and I had omelette. We returned to the Moxy Bar in the evenings too as we found it to be a lovely bright space - great that they have a DJ on each evening too, not too loud either!The hotel location we found to be perfect - everything was walkable. They stored our bags after check-out in a manned room in the basement - all very efficient. We didn't eat at the Legasea Restaurant as we were too tired in the evenings, but it looked lovely.In summary, if you love a bit of chintz curtain or luxury antique furnishings and indeed some privacy when you're sat on the lavatory - maybe you should give The Moxy a swerve - you're just not cool enough! It's dark, funky, smells lovely, clean, loud and efficiently run.

Probably, if I’m being honest, I didn’t like it, either. It’s definitely a great value hotel – at a very cheap time to travel to NYC, rooms were priced in the low $100s. For that maybe it’s worth it, for $300 in primer seasons, yikes, no way.The hotel is Marriott’s take on Starwood’s Aloft, and I’m not necessarily the demographic (older, appreciate nice hotels with lovely lighting and bathrooms with tubs and quality restaurants). So weigh that. Moxy does a lot right. It’s a tight space for sure – I write about cruise travel for a living and I get that, and was impressed by the design of the room and the use of hooks to hang stuff (with hangers provided, too, even I’m not that old-fashioned, laughing). What I hated? No comfortable chair. A bed pushed against the window (a pal on the same trip and her husband laughed about how he had to climb over her to get into bed and at some point that’s not actually charming). No view, just dreary offices across a narrow side street, so you had to keep your blinds closed. Claustro-alert!What I liked? Great shower. Super shower. I think that was the highlight and as I’m a tub person, that’s an unusual acknowledgement. The neighborhood, labeled Times Square, is ambitious. It’s the garment district, that dreary part of town where, on the “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” her hapless husband Joel, works. No good restaurants nearby, not sense of community or neighborhood. Just depressing, though convenient enough to Penn Station. You can walk. You can also walk a few blocks to Times Square. As someone who lived in Manhattan in the 1980s and avoided that area at all costs, well, there you are. I loved the idea of the restaurant, and the service was generally very sweet, and it, located on the second floor so away from the dreariness of the neighborhood, had a wonderful atmosphere. Ate there two nights. Never liked the food. That’s totally subjective, and I acknowledge, but even a Caesar Salad just tasted…not good. And it was expensive. But it was this or Bubba Gump’s Shrimp. I’m just not the right customer for this brand. And if you’re not either, keep looking.And yet: My young friends who are cost-cutting folk and thrilled to be in a clean, safe and contemporary property (inside an old building), will love it. And their mothers will love it, for them, too.","Chestertown, Maryland","CruiseEditor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chestertown, Maryland</strong>",382,3.0

Right on 7th, it's pretty easy to walk everywhere and up to Times Square. We had booked a corner suite (thank goodness) as apparently the other rooms are pretty small. We had a friendly check-in and staff were generally friendly and eager to assist throughout our 6 night stay. It tries to be pretty trendy which is fine, but I find that I am tiring of chain hotels trying to be individual as they generally don't quite get it right. The room was nice enough, great spacious shower, fridge in the room, comfortable bed, there was even make up remover pads and a steamer for getting that little black number looking hot for a night out on the town. But there was no water in the room. There was no tea/coffee maker in the room. So if you wanted a hot drink at 5am - no go - unless you went down to the cafe on the second floor when it opened and paid for the privilege. We ended up going to Walgreens and buying a coffee maker to use during our stay - we shouldnt have to do that. Also, if you are on a higher floor, the noise from the roofdeck partyzone can keep you up until the wee hours. We also had 3 boxes delivered as we were attending an exhibition - these need to be collected 3 doors down and we were charged USD 90.00 for the privilege of them receiving them - c'mon guys - thats half what it cost us to ship them from the UK.

The property itself is nice. I liked the decor and the room, though small, was stylish and functional.

I turned on the lights and was startled to find that about half of the floor in the bedroom was covered in water! I called the front desk and someone came up to look at the situation. The staff person said there was a problem with the bathroom in a room near mine and that, if I wanted another room, I needed to pack up and come downstairs. I agreed, but was annoyed, as I had to be up in a few hours.So, after packing, I headed downstairs to the front desk. There were two staff people there. One gave me a key to another room. I mentioned that this was a real bother, with my early morning schedule. The staff person, who turned out to be an assistant manager, did not seem particularly sympathetic, but said, ""Well, I assume we will comp your room."" No one had told me that, so I said, ""Thanks. My room was already paid by my work, so though that is a nice gesture, it was not that meaningful to me."" He responded that he would give me points in the equivalent of a free night at the hotel - 35,000 points. I thanked him and he gave me his card.About three weeks later, I dropped him a line to say that I had not received anything. He said he forgot to do it, but that he would do it right away, but that it might take 4-5 days to post.I dropped him a line two weeks later, after still having not received the points.

After reading the reviews, I was a little concerned about how the stay would go. MOXY gave us breakfast vouchers as compensation and honored the Chelsea price (less expensive than Times Square) with the same room configuration. The reviews mentioned less-than-helpful staff, very noisy, difficult elevators. None of those things were a problem. We were on the 12th floor; companions were on 8th floor. The room was tiny but this is NYC and I was absolutely aware. The bathroom configuration of having a sliding door that contains shower and commode didn't bother me, as well as the sliding door is heavy and goes floor to ceiling. The shower is fabulous--I need a shower like that every day! The pegs that line one entire wall are very sturdy and provided an easy way to store/stash coats, shirts, jeans, mittens. There are ""cubbies"" under the bed to use for storage. I found the tiny space very practically designed. Staff was gracious at every turn, especially the breakfast crew-friendly, welcoming, accommodating. They have self check-in stations, but there were two staff members in the lobby who welcomed us and offered to check us in. We arrived around 12:45 and one of our rooms were ready and they gave us keys to stash luggage in early--no extra charge. Some complained that they don't like the way the hotel smells--I loved it. Sweet but not cloying. It was also warm and cozy and felt great when the high was 12! The only concern that might really be an issue was the noise of Magic Hour, the rooftop bar. It is popular but the entrance is around the corner, not through the hotel lobby. We could hear faint bass, but it didn't bother us at all. There are 4 floors above us, so maybe if you were higher up? We weren't near the elevators, but they were quiet. I loved the way the elevators work--choose your floor prior to getting in and it assigns an elevator--easy and efficient. Location of this hotel is great--subway stops close, MSG two blocks away, Penn Station two blocks away.

First off I would like to say the hotel was clean and all employees were pleasant. The rooms are decorated nicely albeit small but practical for a short stay. Also the lobby bar was very nice but there were a few things that were off. The elevators are odd to say the least. Fortunately I understood how to use the buttons but many didn’t or needed assistance which caused a back up in lobby area and caused very long wait times. But since I was on the 4th floor I decided to walk up but the stairs are located in a employee area of hotel which is very odd so I needed someone to give us access to the stairs. The other issue with hotel was the noise from the roof top night club. Now being on the 4th floor my room must have at least 20 stories below the club but it sounded as if the DJ was next door. I’m a heavy sleeper but and go to bed late but the music was annoying when trying to get to sleep after 1am. I couldn’t imagine staying on the upper floors with the music blaring. Overall the hotel was really nice but the noise situation would way heavily if I would ever stay again. ,NYC,"TravelAddict403</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",49,4.0

The bathroom sink is in the room. There is no desk, there is only one nightstand. No chairs except two hanging benches with no real space to put them. Difficult to find space for luggage. No closet (just hanging hooks along the wall). The bathroom is a toilet and a shower with a sliding glass door. Fixtures and style is steampunk-institutional, like a mental hospital in a bad movie (sorry). With two in the room, someone has to step back to the wall for the other one to pass by. No amenities, no fridge, no waters. The bar-breakfast area on the 2nd seating is completely threadbare - see the images.

The elevator was tricky... choose where you are going then wave your card - there are no buttons in the elevator! We stayed on the 7th floor - I read reviews where people said the noise level from the roof top club (Magic Hour) was too much. On the 7th floor we did not have this problem. The one complaint is the heating/ A/C unit - now that is loud. Luckily, we were exhausted and this did not hinder our sleep. The beds are really comfy and the bedding was a perfect weight. Loved the toilet in the shower area - they could use an exhaust fan. A hair dryer and clothes steamer is provided. There is not much room, so for a family or a long stay person/couple this may not be ideal. We were there for the weekend so it was ok. It is a fun hotel that offers so much that you dont need to leave to have fun. We ate at Legasea - very cool restaurant-food was delicious-kinda pricey. We went to the Magic Hour - DJ was kickin it old school - drinks were eh and $$$$- fun place none the less. Would like to come back in the summer and check it out. Went to the 2nd floor bar - you get a free glass of prosecco - they will give you a token when you check in. There is a cool lounge on this floor as well with comfy spots to sit and play games. Brunch at The Magic Hour was ok. I had read in a review that they did not have Lipton tea bags or English Breakfast - They still don't. Also our husbands complained about the coffee how terrible it was.

Young, friendly people on hand at front desk. You pretty much do all the work yourself thru a kiosk though. Elevators are tricky, with touch pads and other intricacies, definitely not standard elevators. BUT, once you understand what is going on they work fabulously and there is seldom any waiting at all. Don't like constantly having to use the key card and mine went dead once during the stay, but it is Times Square and security is important. I had the 3 person room with lofted bunk. The room is tiny, smallest i have ever seen in NYCit was clean and everything worked. The shower and toilet share a glass closet; there is a tiny, tiny sink outside for use. All the tables, chairs, storage is on hooks on the long side of the room. I couldn't spend any time being comfortable here, but the location to MSG was great.

The Moxy is not excellent and not very good either it is just good. Above average, but since I am not given the option to rate it good...The Moxy was our choice for our New Year holiday as it is a bit away from the hum drum of Times Square but still well located - next to the Empire and Macy’s etc. Also the price was reasonable for our 9 nights stay. We chose a suite room to have more space. The Moxy presents itself in industrial style chic with metal and wood furnishings. The check-in is DIY - i.e. you check yourself in. Quick and without problems. Staff is on hand in case you do have issues. They have 4 elevators which operate on a program - common issue in high rise hotel buildings, at peak times you wait 5 minutes for your elevator. In the Moxy this was fairly swift. Unlike other hotels where you swipe the hotel-card in the lift, you choose outside on a screen the floor you want to go, the system then asks you to swipe your key card (if it is a room floor) and assigns the lift. Most of the time that actually works. Though New Year’s night they experienced some serious hick-ups and the following day the system erased our floor half way through and we had to get off and re-enter our destination.Our room was a large corner room of around 25-30sqm. From what I have seen the standard rooms are very small. We realized a bit later that from the 17th floor corner room we had unobstructed view on the Empire State Building. For anybody who likes to arrive and immediately arrange their clothes in a closet - you won’t find one. Everything needs to be hung on hooks alongside the wall which depending on the length of your stay might not be enough to hold all of your stuff. Did not bother us we live out of our suitcases.The bed was not the most comfy I ever slept in but ok. To each side were the two most important USB plugs which should be standard in hotels nowadays. They also scored well on my fluffy-white-towel-scale. I hate when hotels give you towels that could pass for dish rags. The bathroom is surprisingly large. At first I was worried about the wet-room style bath where you have no shower separation, but actually it worked well and did not result in major flooding.What was really missing was another mirror outside the bath. There was a second sink without any apparent use why not hang a mirror above? A second bin would be nice too. The worst was the sliding bathroom door. At times impossible to open. The door was super heavy and the handle, if you can call it that gave you so little hold that it was a struggle every time to roll it open. Also the cover in front of the very noisy A/C came off and hung precariously on one broken hinge. On two occasions we returned from a day out well after 4pm to find our room still unmade. Also, being on the 17th floor we found ourselves under the largest roof top bar of NYC, but of course that had a big impact on noise. Sure, complaining about noise in New York is like complaining about sand on the beach. But when the noise gets beyond the capabilities of your earplugs - since we came prepared - then we are talking serious noise. We ended up using our noise cancelling head phones most nights. Admittedly there were more parties around New Year’s eve so a higher than normal noise level was to be expected. I assume during any other time it will be less loud.They do have a bar and apparently outstanding restaurant on 2nd floor. My girlfriend said she had been to the Seafood restaurant previously and confirmed it was very good. The bar is friendly, provides fun seating and games. They also serve food and breakfast fare. There is a egg head downstairs for take-away breakfast (a DD is just next door as well). And then there is the famous roof top bar. We heard it was the largest in NYC with a sort of fun adult theme. One evening after new year we decided to go there with friends. They make a big hu-ha about it, black light activated stamp that is checked some three times between getting on the lift and off the lift on the 18th floor. Then - probably due to the weather - the space was only indoor and so crammed and small, loud and overrun with not our type of crowd, we went straight back down to the Moxy Bar, sat in the squishy old leather arm chairs and had cocktails there. I genuinely did not see the hype of the Magic Hour Roof Top bar.So overall, it gives you a well located place to stay, away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but still close enough, for a decent price. In my opinion it is a good place but I am not sure if I would return. ","Geneva, Switzerland","534tatjanak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",62,3.0

First off the location was great and was only a few blocks from Time square and Macys. Immediately upon walking through the front door, we witnessed an edgy but relaxing vibe atmosphere coupled with the perfumed air (smelt throughout the hotel) created a true wow moment. The staff was more than accommodating and we were able to check in rather quickly. The aesthetics throughout the hotel were very cool and updated, offering a very trendy look. We traveled with both of my kids and it was only for 2 nights. When entering the room, everything was spotless and the theme of the hotel offered up a unique look. We had one queen bed and a loft that was equipped with a bean bag chair and mattress. The bathroom was big for the space and offered a walk in shower that was equipped with rain fixtures and the pressure offered a great experience (didn't want to get out). We must have cracked our head on the bunk beds half a dozen times and always seemed to be in someone way. The bed was comfortable but you felt as if you were sleeping in a vault.

Location is great but that's pretty much where the plus points stop. I emailed the moxy prior to our visit and explained about my husband's birthday and was told they would ""put a note"" on the booking to make sure they made it extra special. That didn't happen as you don't even check in with a real human, just self check in and create a room key yourself. We booked a king room for 4 nights, we expected it to be a bit small which is why we treated ourselves and paid more to get a king room but it was still tiny. The bed took up most of the room and only hooks to keep clothes on. Nicely styled but not practical for people with a suitcase or staying more than a night or two. The noise from the roof top bar was beyond ridiculous. I was looking forward to a nice chilled roof top bar to enjoy the views but this is a roof top nightclub which doesn't close until 4am some nights. You also can't just ""go up"" to the bar if you are a hotel guest, you have to leave the building, go around the corner, get ID'd by a bouncer, get a stamp on your hand, go back in another door, show your stamp to about 5 different people, go up in the lift, show your stamp again and then you're let in. Only to discover you can't have a conversation because it's so loud and so busy that we couldn't be bothered to wait to order a drink. We turned around and left. We called reception to ask to move but were advised there was nothing available until the next night. We barely slept which was horrible after a long journey from the UK. This was made worse by the very noisy AC unit. Ive never knowm anuthing like it! There are also no tea or coffee making facilities available in the room which would be nice after a day our sight seeing.We dealt with a manager called Mike the next day who moved us to the third floor but this was also extremely loud (although neither ourselves or Mike could figure out where the noise was coming from!). He then found another room for us which was much quieter but it was a queen room as there where no quiet king rooms free. This meant moving our things twice and this was happening around midnight. Ww were shattered and wanted nothing more than a quiet place to sleep. Our room then wasn't cleaned and no fresh towels dropped off and we had to call to get some brought to us. When the time came to check out, we asked to speak to a manager. Mike wasn't available so another manager came out and told us he was busy and about to go to a meeting...!! Unhelpful and rude. We described our stay and explained Mike had been very helpful in trying to make our stay better but that fact is we paid for a King size room and ended up staying in a queen. Overall, this hotel is clearly for people in their early twenties or maybe party animals. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to stay if this doesn't describe you or if you want a friendly, warm experience from staff. Staff could be much friendlier and much more helpful, they just look at you like you're an inconvenience to them.",,Helen B,2,2.0

It sounded like there was a club above my room, and I did not get a lot of sleep. I made several requests before check in that I wanted the quietest room possible. I was in town for the New York Marathon and I believe this affected my performance in what I came to town to do.Other issues:My shower kept flooding the bathroom floor no matter which direction I pointed the shower head and I had to use all my towels but one to soak up the water. There was very low water pressure in the sink. The TV kept turning off on its own. I was unable to skip the line at check in because my phone would not work properly to operate the elevator (I have and iPhone 6S and downloaded the app). So I had to get a key card. There was also a lot of street noise. I understand its NYC, but it sounded as if the window was left open. I’ve never experienced noise level inside of an NYC hotel room like that before. I did not get a replacement menu after ordering morning breakfast on the first day. Housekeeping did not visit my room one of the days to replace all my wet towels, make the bed, or take away trash. I made sure I did not turn on the do not disturb light. The bedding felt wet the first night as if it was not completely dried after cleaning. I did not get my scheduled wake-up call the day of check out and almost missed my scheduled ride to the airport.I don’t know if this is a typical experience at Moxy, the noise level probably is, so I would not recommend staying here to anyone. The experience certainly did not live up to the Marriot name, especially for the inflated price during marathon weekend.

I complained about the room as travelling with two large suitcases filled the room, in which there are no wardrobes - only hooks around the room! The staff I found very unfriendly and rude, almost as though we were a pain to them, we got messed around with our room situation and then was told we had to pay an additional fee to move rooms, which we went along with. To find the next room equally as small just the bed an inch bigger!!! To get to the bathroom we had to make a walk way in the night with our cases, then waking up move the cases around to get out of the room!!! Not to mention the fact ear plugs get left my the side of your bed because of the volume of noise from the bars. Not something that is appreciated after a long day exploring NYC.

Experience marriott traveler with all brands. Here’s my summary Pros Not much I can think of. Location. Cons and worse: Rooms like a jail cell. Tiny. Confining. Claustrophobic. Not practical. Not functional. Ha ha value and cutesie industrial boutique fades real fast. Twenty somethings who like hostels and believe a room is a room may find it perfect. Check in process horrible and absolutely chaotic, confusing and platinum status meaningless to staff. It’s 4 pm with no exceptions even though I exchanged texts at 1 pm and they confirmed room near elevator that was supposedly a nicer king. Can’t imagine what the lesser room was. Breakfast option at hotel small tiny menu and service poor. Hard to get server attention. Bar at night obnoxiously pounding club music and bar staff barely cracked a smile. Awful service. Legasea food ok but seats at bar could not be more uncomfortable. Made for tiny people and commoditized to maximize seats. Underwhelming place. Roof top bar a 21 to 40 year old club. 5 deep at bar, conversation impossible. Demographic very evident. In short, the world is diverse. Vibrant is great. Unique is great. Vibrant unique practical comfortable and classy are optimal. I get marketing and demographics but get a clue Marriott. Basics are service, comfort, choices (over 40 music perhaps ?!) and did I say service ??Finally At these type Marriott properties (similar to vegas ) platinum status (I’m few dollars from ambassador) has no special attention or value.

In the bunkbed room, the heater was so loud (loud fan) that it was impossible to sleep with it on, the shelf for phone next to the bed was broken so couldn't put a phone there, the toilet kept blocking leading to having to call for maintenance, the sink was also quite blocked as water going down was extremely slow. In addition, the extra cost pre-paid for breakfast was not worth it - very small choice with additional cost for a number of items that I would consider normal in a 4* hotel (e.g. cappuccino, juice etc). In addition, the majority of staff were friendly, however in the breakfast area they were very slow.I spend a minimum or 3-4 nights per week in hotels due to work travel each week (and have been doing this for a number of weeks) and this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had in a long time.

And - of course - they were placed there for a reason....The combination of street noise, roof-top DJ noise and A/C noise made it impossible to sleep. Spent 3 nights here with zero sleep. Walked the streets of New York as a zombie, and deeply regretted my choice of hotel.So - if you stay at this hotel it is crucial that you get a room facing the inner courtyard.","Alesund, Norway","Kimmen1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alesund, Norway</strong>",235,2.0

The bed would not suit anybody over 6ft as there is a TV and speaker at the end of the bed which takes up foot space. Bathroom was almost the same size as the bedroom, which was a little unnecessary, space could be made better use of! Shower wasn't closed off correctly meaning the bathroom would be covered in water when one of us was in there.There isn't enough storage and the aircon made a horrifically loud noise throughout the night waking us up practically on the hour, every hour. On checkout, we asked to store or luggage - 5 pieces in total and were given one tag. We informed the member of staff looking after the storage room that we were collecting two pieces of luggage to start with and would return later that day to collect the remaining pieces. The staff member took the tag off us and said no problem but when my partner returned later that day to collect the other pieces of luggage, the guy would not give them to him as he had no tag however this was taken off us when we first collected. We then had to wait until we could get access to another piece of our luggage to find the code that the luggage was labelled under before he would give us them. Terrible experience and just caused unnecessary stress! On check in we were given two drinks tokens to enjoy a drink at the bar/ When redeeming these we were given flat prosecco. When querying this with the bar staff, I was told that because it was free, it was free, it was flat. My advice would be if you're going to offer complimentary drinks - at least offer something worthwhile rather than the cheapest option, it's not worth the gesture otherwise!Nice hotel, terribly planned out rooms and poor use of available space.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","Jenni-Fleet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",22,3.0

I loved the decor. There were a few things that weren't great though: Firstly, the shower water never actually got hot, just luke warm, and in 38 degree NYC weather, it was kind of depressing. Secondly, the heater/AC was SUPER loud. They did supply you with earplugs but if you're a light sleeper, that might make a difference to you. I wore the ear plugs but woke up to the AC as I was drifting off to sleep each night. Thirdly, even though my do not disturb light was on, the restaurant in house (Egghead) knocked on my door to deliver breakfast at 8am, even though I did not order it. (I'm from the west coast so 8am was like being woken up at 5am.) Fourthly, the doors to the hallway are really thin. They actually have a frosted glass window in them (which thankfully you can cover with the canvas curtain they provide), which helps allow for sound to get into your room. Thankfully i was on a quieter floor, but everytime someone would go in or out of their room, it sounds like they're standing in yours. I did like the ""Stash"" closets they have on your floor, where you can get irons, extra pillows, and razors, deodorant, all types of amenities. It was very convenient to just walk out and grab what you need instead of having to call down to the front desk for it. I also found that the staff was extremely helpful and courteous.

I was not disappointed. What fun it was to just arrive in the lobby which was welcoming and friendly. The wall sized signboard flashed numbers and letters before settling into a fun message of encouragement or welcome. The standing staff were paired with self-serve check-in kiosks for those who preferred less chitchat. I opted for the former and the chitchat lasted all of about a minute before I was checked in. My room was not ready, though, as I was arriving early in the day, so I checked my bags and found my way up the fully automated elevator (you punch in your destination and are assigned to a particular waiting elevator) to the lounge upstairs to work a bit before my first meeting. The lounge was spacious and arranged with a variety of tables, bars, sofas and coffee tables of all sizes with plugs everywhere for the many, like me, who were here to work. When I found my guestroom, later that evening, the origins of the building were easier to see in the upper hallways where the architecture and layout was designed to reflect back to it's original purposes. Each guestroom was a small office and the floors were oriented around an 18 floor atrium. The lights at each door announced the room number and the doors had pulldown, oldtime shades for privacy. The rooms themselves are quite small, but the decor is arranged to maximize space and give a sense of airiness nevertheless. The bed is heavenly, though it was pushed up to a window that looked out at other windows, necessitating closed shades at all times. The remaining furniture is cleverly folded up and hung on the wall, so that you need only open and use the furniture you need at the moment (brilliant!) and the sink and mirror and cosmetics station is very narrow and designed latrine style in the hallway as you enter, leaving the uniquely designed toilet stall and curtainless shower (with a wonderful rainshowerhead) behind a sliding door. It's quirky, but very efficiently designed and, to be honest, fun! The hardwood floors may have been ambiently heated, as I never felt a lack of warmth, however the space could certainly have benefited by a rug or carpet to soften the footfall. I cannot end without exclaiming about the rooftop bar. I don't drink and rarely bother to venture into a hotel bar, but this one I had to see. The rooftop has a phenomenal view of the Empire State Bldg, lit up at night above you, adn the indoor outdoor bar has a rotating seating ""carousel"", and a small mini-golf facility under the lights of the city. I will try to post pics if I can. I enjoyed my short stay, and would come again, but probably only when traveling alone, unless other rooms are larger.

However, on a recent business trip to NYC, the Moxy was the only property I could find in my budget and in the Starwood/Marriott group. After reading some reviews and researching the amenities, I decided to give it a shot.The ""Times Square"" location is a bit misleading since it's not really near Times Square, but nevertheless, you should not be disappointed with this location. It's convenient to many things, including Times Square, 5th Avenue, MSG just to name a few. With heavy traffic, this is still a 1 hour+ trip to/from LGA, but that's not unexpected in NYC.Service at the Moxy really is quite good but not perfect. I don't expect the trendy, more casual hotels like this (and W) to offer good service since I don't feel people choose these hotels for their prowess in this area, but the Moxy is no slouch. Front desk, bar, housekeeping - all so pleasant, but when I requested maintenance for a leaky shower wall via the SPG app, the staff acknowledged the request but didn't actually fix the problem.I was so surprised at the quality of the fitness center. Yes, it's small, but they make the most of this space: pulley station, dumbbells, benches, several cardio machines, and even kettlebells! I cannot tell you how happy I was to see a 20 and 24kg kettlebell in a hotel gym.Now, for the rooms ... they are definitely good and bad, and other reviewers have valid points for both sides of that argument. The rooms are expectedly small, but fortunately my Elite status gave me an upgrade to the ""double"" double-bed room. In lieu of a closet and luggage rack, at least you have another bed on which you can put your stuff. There are folding tables and a few hangers, but just know that you should certainly not expect a typical hotel experience in this regard. You get a steamer instead of an iron, which is fine, but as another reviewer noted, the A/C is loud and obnoxious. Without a white noise machine, this would have been a problem for me. The TV is huge and has a convenient guide, and the bathroom ... wow is the bathroom impressive. It's enormous given the size of the room, and I was actually wondering why they didn't make the room bigger and the bathroom smaller.

They are small but the use of the space we thought was amazing, and I read reviews before booking knowing that they were very compact. Although we didn't get to enjoy the free drinks we got during check-in because my son was not old enough to visit the rooftop bar, we did sneak up the following day during brunch hours to be able to show him how neat it was. Our only recommendation would be to somehow fit a small mini fridge in the rooms. It's nice to be able to put some drinks in for the next day or to keep things cool.

Check in was very smooth and the staff was polite during check in. Rooms: The rooms are like dorm rooms which I was not expecting at the prime rate I was paying. It was literally the size of a walk in closet. I had room 518 and it was somewhat quiet but can definitely hear all the NYC city traffic noise. Also, there is not trash bins in the room so if you have papers or anything to get rid of you will need to get rid of it at the trash bin in the lobby. I did like that they had a steamer in the room as my suits looked pressed each day. The Bar - The bar on the second floor is amazing decor wise however, I ordered the “box of Chicken” which is a fried chicken meal however when it was served to me the chicken was cooked on the outside and raw in the inside absolutely just grossed me out. Their cocktailMenu is limited however the bartenders are happy to make you anything you like. Magic Hour- The rooftop bar is impressive however the bartenders are not very friendly and the door staff are really rude to hotel guest. I was I would have had a different experience.Housekeeping - As you can imagine on business trip your days are long. I would be out by 7am and return to the hotel by like 9pm or 10pm and daily i would have to call down forThem to restock the towels and reclean the room.I was at this hotel for 5 days on business so it was very frustrating to deal with things that should have happen particularly this being a Marriott brand hotel. Late check out- I had requested a late check out due to my flight delays and was granted it and was willing to pay the fee. So i was working from the hotel when housekeeping knocked on my door and said i needed to check out because they needed to room. I explained that I had pay for the late check out she stated that she was not aware and she needed the room. At this point I did not want to argue as it was already a rough week. So i checked out and requested to speak to a manager. The manager did apologize and removed the fee for the late check out. I am aware this is tourist area however the hotel is branded for all guest tourist and/or business travelers. I truly wished my experience could have been different.

In that sense, the Moxy NYC Times Square should fit the bill just fine.Here are some of the points worth mentioning about the rooms and my stay:- rooms are indeed on the small side and designed with functionality in mind; the basin and respective shelf are in the main room, while a walk-in shower and toilet are separated through a sliding door (might be worth bringing some matches if you're staying as a couple in the room - fyi)- I had a single room but I guess it could sleep 3 people - two in the big bed, and one in the bunk bed on top (careful not to bump your head, as I did)- this seems to be a fairly new hotel and everything looks clean and modern; the common areas of the hotel look lively and trendy- the shower & conditioner are quite good, so if you're not too fussy about using your own products, the hotel's should be fine; water pressure in the shower is good, too- there is no closet at all, and clothes can be hung on some hangers on the wall or stored underneath the bed- the bed filled the entire back end of the room, and you needed climb over the bed to be able to open the window- even though the Moxy hotel brand seems to be geared at a young & trendy crowd, I found that the general profile of guests was quite mixed- after reading some of the reviews, I was concerned about the level of noise in the hotel because of the bar(s), but my room on the 8th floor was nice and quiet- my room had no view (interior patio) and I kept the shutter down, as the neighbouring building and windows were just across - if a view is important to you, inquire about a room with street views- staff were fine, generally, and service was smooth- on one day, housekeeping didn't show up at my room even though I had not left the 'do not disturb' sign on while out of my room- the rooftop bar is really beautiful (great views of the Empire State Building), as is the bar on the second floor- Internet works very well throughout the hotel- the location is your typical convenient Midtown location - close to several subway stations, Penn Station, and walking distance to some of the main Midtown attractions; other than that, the surrounding area is rather nondescript (which is true for much of Midtown) but you have all you need in the way of delis, shops, pharmacy etc nearbyUltimately, I would stay here again if I got the same rate as for my last stay (paid a little over $200 per night including fees and taxes) and if I can't get a better deal at some comparable Downtown hotel, which is an area I'd generally favor over Midtown.","Barcelona, Spain","plfa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",131,4.0

On the first night of our stay, two strangers opened our door at 12:30am. I fell asleep already while my friend who stayed awake freaked out. The two strangers found us, said “oh, someone’s in’ and left quickly. My friend waked me up and trembled heavily. We felt so scared and called the front desk immediately. The front desk was not helpful at all. They said the manger was on the way. We waited at least 20mins before the manager showed up. I told him what happened but he showed no sympathy and concern. He said there’s never an accident like this happened before. I requested for camera footage however he told me there’s no cameras in the hall. He said there’s nothing he can do at this moment and the investigation would be carried out the next day! We felt great shock and scared. The manager said if you want to change another hotel, you can do that too!The next day, no one contacted us! We went to the front desk and another manager was on duty. I told her the story again. She said the investigation was done. And it’s our fault because we left the door ajar! What a hilarious explanation. We had done several experiments and could not just ‘close’ the door while left it not shut! We insisted to look at the camera footage but she said there’s none!We thought this ridiculous experience was over! But we were too optimistic. On 25th, we went back to our room in the afternoon to drop our shopping bags and to go to an appointment in downtown. When we got to the room, neither of card could open the door. I went downstairs to the front desk. The staff checked a lot of information and activated my room key. I climbed back to 14th floor, just finding out that the room key still didn't work. There’s a housekeeper walking by. I seek for her help. But her room key could not open the door too! She called the engineers, who came to us 10mins later. However, they could not open the door with their cards! They made a call and told us that’ the manger wanted to meet us and shut the door!’ I felt great shock again. A manager shut us out just because he want to see us?! They have my telephone number and email but neither of them was used by them. The front desk even didn’t tell me it was the manger who wanted to see me! I climbed down and asked for the manger. Believe it or not! It was the manager who ignored us on the first night AGAIN! He said coldly that our credit card could not be charged and had to shut the door. I said it’s impossible. When we checked in, a staff told us that she would charge more than the price on the bill and when we checked out the extra money would go back to our card. She succeeded in charging the card and gave us the room keys! How come we would owe the hotel money on the sixth day? The manager said there’s 700USD he could not charge and he had not choice but shut the door. We had been stuck in the hotel for 1 hour and missed our appointment. The manager said he would make an extra and opened the door for us this time but we had to talk to him when we came back! What a drama! It seemed that we were begging him to open our door! Facts are here: 1) we had enough balance on our card and the money had been charged for the first day; 2) if they could not charge the rest stated 700USD, it was their problem not ours. When we came back to the hotel we found another manger was on duty. He said we were all set. I asked about the 700USD. He said it was successfully charged this afternoon! See, we did nothing to the card. The transaction problem was totally from the hotel side!I felt great disappointed and angry. On the day we checked out, we told the story AGAIN to their operating manager (the fourth manager I'd repeated my story). But she’s not helpful at all too! I’ve told the stories to them for more than four times but I got no apologies and explanation! She was impatient in our story.I write my story here to seek help and remind all the potential customers that there’re so many other good hotels in New York (I’ve visited New York 6 times.) the management team here humiliated us again and again!

The hotel also offer ear-plugs within the room and this is pretty obvious why, the outside noise can be quite loud.

However, this isn’t anything the hotel hasn’t already said. I understand from the marketing campaign, the hotel is “focused on the millennial traveller”. I’m not confident however, that it’s aim encompasses all millennials. My stay with Moxy was average and I say this because there were very clever styling methods which benefited me during my stay. This included what I thought was an amazing shower, I swear I spent at least two hours one morning. It’s designed as a rainfall shower but if you’re travelling with more than one person and sharing the room, privacy is most certainly not at the top of the list. With only frosted glass acting as a speedster and the small space of the room itself you’ll probably be able to see and hear what the other is doing. There are USB ports located so you don’t need to travel with adapters and the hotel will provide you with one if you need. The issue will stem from trying to find a socket (power outlet in your room) as this is fairly limited. There is furniture available if you need to use it (just requires some quick assembly of no more than thirty seconds). This however, significantly reduces the space to navigate around the hotel room. The room came with a safe which is underneath the bed and also some limited storage space (under the bed) and on the walls etc and everything else (soap, gels) as standard. Fresh towels were provided daily. Given that the hotel lifts operate a keycard mechanism it made it highly unlikely you’d find an unwelcome guest making it through to the section which housed the rooms itself. There was a separate entrance for the rooftop bar which caused its own issues and I will explain a little later. The bar area is absolutely gorgeous and I think I ended everyday with a drink. A good selection, quick service and great atmosphere. There is a restaurant and gym onsite for those who are interested. Personally, I explored the city’s other restaurants during my stay. There is a rooftop bar which I understand is operational most nights and while the room does much to insulate you from the sound, the noise of partying guests will keep you up. Invest in some good ear plugs to avoid being woken up by those revellers. All in all, an average experience given that there was some trade offs with space, noise, privacy for the price that I paid. However, the strategic location (smack bang in Manhattan) meant that I was within arms reach of everything I wanted to do and therefore really saved me time and money so I would recommend this as a place to stay if you travel.

In fact, this is one of the reasons I've stayed at the Moxy regularly.The reception left and returned with a manager (male) who indicated (without asking any questions of the situation) that the Moxy never had accepted VCNs and that this was actually fraud. It felt very much like they were accusing me of fraud. He also specified that he would fire anyone of his staff who would accept a VCN (as proof that they hadn't accepted VCNs in the past. I was told my only option was to fill out a ""third party authorization"" form, which is equivalent to what the VCN sends Moxy. The manager was condescending and didn't take the time for fully understand the situation. He jumped to conclusions and made me feel extremely uncomfortable with his accusatory position. I would feel uncomfortable every being checked in any hotel by this individual again.I couldn't fill out the ""third party billing"" form as I am not authorized sign for this credit card (that the room was reserved under). I called may travel agent for assistance at this point, and they confirmed that the Moxy should have all the information needed to pay for my room. At this point, a DIFFERENT manager came out and she was very helpful. Before jumping to any conclusions she asked questions about the situation, and then proceeded to check my room reservation on their system. She discover that the hotel DID in fact have my VCN on file, and that they only required a credit card for incidentals, which I was happy to provide. The manager apologized for the confusion and misunderstanding; and I was just happy to get out of there. I can guarantee that it was NEVER specified to me that they only wanted a card for incidentals, but I again was made to feel uncomfortable when the receptionist responded to her manager saying... ""oh yeah, that's all I asked for - a credit card for incidentals"". A part from the second manager who was helpful, understanding, and kind; it was a very uncomfortable check in experience for a hotel that I have enjoyed going to in the past. This was very disappointing.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","GoPlaces18100967727</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,2.0

The location is great for exploring Manhattan. And the shower was good and unusually large for such a small room. That's about it.So what didn't we like about the Moxy? How about with the fact my wife had a shopping bag taken from the room. Instead of taking responsibility, management have been dismissive and after a week of obfuscating eventually accused us of leaving the room unlocked. As it turns out the two times they claim we left the room unlocked we were 1) out actually buying the items that were stolen, and 2) we hadn't event checked in to the hotel! This matter is yet to be resolved despite our best efforts.The rooms are TINY, which you expect in Manhattan, but this was a new level of small in our experience. Compounding this issue was the fact the air-conditioning motor was located in the room within a wall cavity next to the bed. To make matters even worse again, the bed was pushed right up against said wall. Every time the unit started up (when the AC was actually working that is) it sounded like a car was driving through the room. The ear-plugs on the bed side table were a sign of what was to come. Leaving the AC off was simply not an option as the room was like a sauna, despite cool conditions outside.Finally, there is no storage to hang clothes. Zero. There's also nowhere to place suitcases so they are out of the way. Overall, very basic amenities provided in the room.","Grafton, Australia","adamvcarroll</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grafton, Australia</strong>",1,2.0

From here to the statue of liberty was one line straight down, and 30 minutes, which would be the most travel time around the island. There’s also a transit train to Newark airport from Penn station which is the closest station to this hotel. The hotel stands out so you can always see it from afar, and really it was the best location I think we could have had.To the hotel itself. It tries to make a kind of community, there are two bars, one rooftop and one on the second floor, which is the din you can hear when you enter. They have game nights and fitness classes and pop up shops and things going on. We were given a free drink when we arrived redeemed at the second floor bar, and it is a nice bar, not too crowded, and a nice chilled atmosphere. (A decent Scotch whisky collection – important to me). There are no restaurants ‘in house’ meaning there are two restaurants I guess run by the hotel but they are open independently of it and anyone can walk by. One is some kind of breakfast fast food place, called ‘eggheads’ which only sell eggs with things. (And doesn’t sell tea, but does do coffee) the other restaurant is called Legasea and as you would imagine, is a seafood place. We didn’t try either of these places.Therefore room service is not an option at this hotel. I was desperate for some water one evening and had to go to the bar and buy a bottle for $3.27. The room doesn’t come with a kettle and it wasn’t an option to get one.The room itself was tiny. I was prepared for this reading the reviews, but the overall feeling I got was that they went for style over substance, and the small space might have been better designed. There no wardrobe or drawers or anything, so we lived out of our suitcase; not the end of the world. There was some shelf space under the bed, and a bedside table. The double bed was pushed against the wall, which was an endless annoyance to whoever was sitting or lying on the bed further away from the wall. There were no chairs. The bed itself seemed a little short as well. This was illuminated because at the foot of the bed there was a widescreen TV (With a Netflix button built into the remote!) and on more than one occasion my partner who is average height, kicked the tv and the sound bar that was attached, sometimes dislodging the sound bar from the wall.The TV was cool though, we signed into our Netflix and got American stuff.The bed was very comfortable, we slept very well. It’s just a shame it was poorly positioned. I was stuck with the side close to the wall and had to make-shift a bedside table using the top of the “art” on the wall (which was in a box). Only this side of the bed had a plug socket for phones etc, which is great, but you plug something in, but can’t rest the item anywhere. And my camera batteries etc were hanging loose, and I slept with the phone in my bed.The only other plug socket was by the door, a bit too far away for the person sleeping that side.As there is no closet space, the room has hooks all the way round it. Even behind the TV which might explain why the TV wasn’t able to go up higher out of kicking distance. These came with about 3 coat hanger hooks to hang up, apparently 3 garments between us. I was able to retrieve more hangers, but the space to use actual available hooks was limited and ended up covering the mirror or the light switch etc.The bathroom was again very nice, but not especially ergonomic. First thing to mention is that it was separated from the room by a slide door that didn’t close the whole way, and was designed with a kind of translucent mesh, so we could see everything each other was doing, on the toilet, at the sink, and in the shower. (Thank goodness my partner and I have been together for nearly 10 years… and we have nothing to hide.)The shower was wonderful. Really strong and hot. It DID unfortunately leak, which I think could be easily fixed by bringing the rubber seal down, or just added literally a squared centimetre to the bottom. This being a hipster place, the room has no kind of brochure or compendium with information. The staff were very helpful, but you had to interact to get answers. I wanted an extra pillow and how it worked for these things was that every floor came with a room called “the stash” and you can use your key card to get in and take what you need, such as extra towels (useful for a leaky shower) extra pillows and coat hangers.We stayed on floor 14, and although it was quiet most of the day time, at night the rooftop bar opens and even with windows shut, you can clearly hear the bar. It didn’t keep me up (though it did my partner), and it wasn’t pleasant when going to sleep. I was given the option of a high or low floor and close high because I thought there might be some nice views, but the rooms look in on itself, as the hotel is in a square shape, so I would recommend staying in a lower floor than 14 (the bar is on 18) if you are a light sleeper.The hotel gave free wifi which automatically connected every time and was nice and fast.We deduced from the internet that check out was at 12. The final thing to say I guess is that the staff were all very attentive and helpful. We never had to hang around long to get answers to anything or to check in and out.I probably would stay again as the rate was fine and the location was amazing. But these were really the only factors I feel it had going for it. Not a problem really if, like us, you’re not really there to hang out in the hotel at all. I’d also recommend it for a group of friends maybe who are looking to enjoy the night life, or single travellers.If you’d prefer a bit more luxury and the option for room service and a more traditional hotel experience, this probably isn’t the hotel for you. Think of it as a glamorous, and very clean hostel.","Twickenham, United Kingdom","Ashagill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Twickenham, United Kingdom</strong>",27,3.0

I would have loved it at 23 years old. As a 40-something business traveler, it wasn't a good fit. Pros:- Great location- The 2nd floor common area has a great energy. Most hotels struggle to get a ""fun"" vibe in the bar/restaurant, but with such small rooms and mostly tourists, it felt like everyone was hanging out- Rooftop bar was lively- Coffee/food wasn't ridiculously overpriced like most hotels- Newer bed/pillows so it was very comfortableCons:- Tiny room, tiny bathroom, sink in bedroom (you've read this before)- The rooftop bar goes until 3:00 AM. They provided earplugs, but it wasn't enough (it wasn't the noise, it was the bass shaking the room)- The elevators are S-L-O-W- Gym is just OK (small; few machines)Net net, good budget hotel for the right person/group.

What I did not know was that the hotel is extremely noisey. The nightclub went well into the early morning hours. This spot does not have a cute trendy lobby. But it does have a largish bar in addition to the adjacent noisey nightclub. No in room coffee. I was sent to this bar for what I thought was complimentary morning coffee. $10 including tip for one cup of. Takeaway black coffee. There is, by the way, a coffee shop next door.I usually don’t like to complain, but my stay had been miserable, so when asked, I told the desk clerk about the noise level, the crowded elevators, etc. She apologized and said I would get 2000 points. Fortunately, I had not expected any compensation because the point were never credited. I did get credited with a couple of small tips from the bar for which I had no knowledge. I had paid cash for the coffee. I tried disputing them but gave up when I got no reply. They were, after all, small. And I had already decided I would not be back.

Decor was different and exuded current. Staff was always happy and helpful. As a seasoned traveller of both luxury, mid market and budget hotels for both work and leisure I have to be honest and say Moxy misses the mark as a hotel for sleeping and being comfortable but makes up for it as a great nightclub.The rooms are tiny even for New York standards. Housekeeping can be bit more diligent as our first room was dirty with used q-tips and tissues and the second room had a pair of ladies underwear stuffed down the side of the bed. (given the demographics of the clientele I gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt and suspect the previous guests left them to be discovered by the next guests) The hotel has some clever designs in the small rooms by having multiple hooks instead of a wardrobe and folding furniture to save on valuable space but the beanbag chair takes up so much of the room that we asked for it to be removed so we could at least have some space to store suitcases. Our first room that we slept in was two levels below the rooftop bar/cub on the 17 floor but the noise and vibrations from the club actually woke us up at 2:30 in the morning and went on past 4:00am. The following day we asked to be moved to another room and as mentioned in some other reviews the rooms at the back of the hotel are very dark and has really noisy air-conditioning units. Even in a mid level room (9th floor) we could hear the noise of the rooftop club but thankfully no reverberations from the music. We suspected that the rooms were noisy as the hotel supplied Moxy branded earplugs ready on the bedside tables when you check in!On the positive side the hotel has a fantastic and Rooftop Club, in a fantastic location, two streets away from Macys, Times Square and Fifth Avenue also Penn Station & subway stations are literally 5 minutes walk so getting around is a breeze. The Moxy Hotel's 2nd Floor bar/cafe is great place with sofas/ loungers and free seating to chill and have a simple bite to eat or relax and The Legasea Restaurant offers fantastic seafood menu and worth a visit. Overall if you are looking for a quiet restful place to stay Moxy is not for you! If you are looking for a convenient hip and happening energetic place to crash then this is it!","Hong Kong Island, China","MaxSpark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong Island, China</strong>",40,3.0

The check in process was a breeze. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The decor was hip, sleek and modern. When they say it's an alternative to the usual hotel stay, they hit the nail on the head. Yes, some of the rooms are on the small side, but they're incredibly well designed and the 3 of us never really felt like we were in each other's way at all. The shower was just what you need after a long day of touring the city. Not only is it really cleverly designed, we can't say enough about the shower. Great pressure, very relaxing.The location was great. Minutes from Time Square, Bryant Park, subway stops and other shopping and amenities makes the address ideal. The have a couple of bars in the hotel and another rooftop bar that sits in the shadows of the Empire State Building. Amazing ambience and a great photo op.

It’s great for one night, close to Penn Station and the train, and the restaurants in the hotel are great. The rooms have a Scandinavian design aesthetic, but they are the smallest hotel rooms I’ve ever seen in my life. And the lighting in the vanity area is not great for putting on makeup.Check in was quick and seamless. We also grabbed a snack at the bar at Legasea and found the food and cocktails to be really good. I also love that Marriott now has an app where you can request services (wake up calls, extra towels, pillows, etc.).My only real complaint is the noise. At least they leave you ear plugs on the nightstand. I’m not sure why the rooftop bar is so noisy and why you can hear the noise in your room- I’ve stayed at other hotels with a similar setup and the noise wasn’t so much of an issue.This hotel is not a good option for families, extended stays, business travelers that need a desk or workspace, or those looking for a ton of creature comforts.

Firstly let me get one thing clear right off the bat. This “hotel” is nothing but a glorified backpackers hostel. If you’re looking for somewhere quick to spend the night while you’re out partying throughout to the early morning and you’re between 21-35, go right ahead, this place will do fine. If you’re travelling with luggage, kids, want decent sleep and service, look somewhere else. I understand that they’re trying to be hip and cool by being different, but by focusing on one small demographic, you alienate such a large customer base by trying to be edgy. The hanging furniture on the wall is nothing but a hipster way of giving you uncomfortable fold out furniture for your room. The bathroom was adequate, however it lacked basic toiletries provided in most other hotels. The only items were a bar of hand soap, two cups, and body wash/hair wash and conditioner in pump bottles secured to the shower wall. The bed was bearable, but the pillows were so flat that they were non-existent. I called the front desk twice about getting an extra pillow, but after waiting an hour and a half and calling twice more, I gave up. Housekeeping was abysmal. I called the front desk on multiple occasions requesting the aforementioned pillow, and again when the room ran out of toilet paper. After two more phone calls and 45 minutes of waiting, they finally arrived with two rolls and no apology. I also had someone from housekeeping come to my room saying that they were coming to clean the room even though my Do Not Disturb sign was illuminated. After telling them that I had organised no such thing, they were adamant that I had requested it and tried entering my room without my permission. Room placements are a complete mess unless you’re a party animal because there is a rowdy bar on the second floor, and an obnoxiously loud club on the rooftop that goes on until 4am. The only saving grace is that they provide earplugs. However if you’re unlucky like me, you’ll find yourself with a box with no earplugs inside. At least it’s the thought that counts. The elevators are clever, although frustrating, and can cause congestion at peak times, be prepared to use the stairs to save waiting for 20 minutes. What left the worst taste in my mouth however was the lack of service from the front of house staff. Everyone was more interested in hanging out and chatting with friends rather than look after their guests. While asking one of the staff downstairs a question about the easiest way to get to Grand Central Station, they overheard one of their friends helping someone get to a bar, to where they completely ignored my question and went over to another guest and started talking to them about the bar. All in all, if you’re young, hip, and fashionable, they’ll treat you like a king and you’ll have a great time. If you’re anything else, consider other options. ",,Sanele L,5,2.0

From the beginning, they did not have our hotel room ready and they still didn’t the next two times they gave us that they said it would be ready. The room was half the size of the smallest room I had ever been in before. The width of the room is the length of a queen bed plus six inches. You can’t walk around the bed. The shower and toilet are in the same room without a door or curtain between them. Room is so small that toilet paper stays wet from the shower. The hallways were very claustrophobic... about half of the width of a standard hotel. Felt like a hotel room you would have in Japan... Tiny. The room and “communal” area had offensive pictures. Very disturbing vibe in the hotel. Elevators are completely computerized (no buttons) which sounds great until it takes 25 minutes to get down stairs. Included breakfast is in the bar, not a restaurant. This hotel tries to be so different that it has lost its basic service of providing a comfortable place to stay.

Needless to stay I wasn't interested in staying there. Seeing a rat less than 1 foot from your face is traumatic. I will never forget it and had trouble sleeping after the incident.

When we walked into reception the music was extremely loud and instantly you could tell this was a party hotel.The staff were very friendly however upon check in they told me that the room I had booked (a double room) wasn’t available until the next night as they had other guests staying. This was extremely annoying as my company had paid for a double room and the hotel was booked about 3 weeks in advance with a note to say late check in. As it was 1am by this point I just accepted and went to go up to my room. Upon arrival in my room I opened the door and no joke I wheeled my suitcase in, closed the door and could touch all four walls that’s how small it was. I brushed it off thinking it’s only for one night so proceeded to routinely make sure all was clean before settling in.To my shock when pulling the sheets back I found that the sheet and the mattress protector were soiled with bodily fluid from another guest. Not what you want to see when trying to settle in for your stay and especially not what you want to see after a long flight (by this point 1:30am in the morning). I called down to reception who after 5 minutes of ringing finally picked up. I explained that the sheets and bedding were unclean and to my UTTER AMAZEMENT the staff member said “would you like us to move you to a different room?”- there was no apology and no real care that the room was still unclean from the guest before. Nor did they seem to think it was an issue that I had a soiled bed. Anyway after speaking to them I got moved to another room- again a single bedroom- which was a bit bigger (and I couldn’t reach all 4 walls by standing in the middle)- the room was clean this time and I was finally able to get to bed at 2am.This hotel would be ideal for any teenager or young traveller who just wants a place to stay whilst they are on holiday and having fun. It is very much geared around partying- they have games in the reception, free drink token upon arrival and the rooms provide ear plugs with a note about if the music is too loud to use them. The decor is very modern, the rooms are compact but small so fun to look at but not the place to stay at all when on business.They do advertise for all groups of people which I do think is wrong considering the type of hotel it is. We had parcels delivered which we had to pick up from down the street at another location as they don’t take in packages. I have visited a fair few hotels in New York and although a lot of hotels can be small in the city- this took compact to a new level. The entire stay for me was not pleasant and I would personally never want to stay here again.","Berkshire, United Kingdom","Martinela20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",26,1.0

I reserved the loft room since I needed two separate beds. The sink was in the hallway and the outlets for the dryer were in weird areas. What we didn’t like was the noise we heard throughout the night. We were woken up at least 5 times and did not rest well at all. Plus, the pillows were so flat and uncomfortable. They barely provide toiletries. Just body wash and conditioner in pumps in the shower. The location was ok. Next time, I’d rather stay at midtown or anything further away from the chaotic Times Square. Overall, we were not happy with this hotel.

We asked to change and were given a better room both being a better size and reasonable sounding air con. However only one flat pillow each on the bed. No wardrobe, just hooks on the wall and stupid furniture hanging up. A most uncomfortable bean bag seat. Bathroom was large and had a big shower. Essentially this was a wet room. There was nowhere to put your toiletries. With contact lenses that need a shelf for the container I took up the whole of the tiny shelf over the sink. The rest had to sit on the floor or on the windowsill in the bedroom. There were a couple of drawers provided under the bed and open shelves for anything else. Only hair/shower gel plus conditioner provided in large dispensing containers. Nothing else. We were told there is a store that guests can access. We looked for more pillows. None and having phoned housekeeping for more we expected them before bedtime. None came and we had to ask again and again. Only when the store was replenished we were able to get them. Breakfast was very limited. No fruit juice and only 6 or 7 options to choose from.

This is not a hotel for families with young children. Great location to Time Square and excursions pick up. If you’re a solo traveller , you need not worry about safety . The hotel has many cool features to enjoy and admire. My room was spacious and all the amenities you need except for lotion, slippers and snacks and water to purchase. I had to ask room service for clean towels but that wasn’t a big deal to me. Everyone I encounter were very polite and very accommodating. The Magic Hour is a rooftop club/ bar/ restaurant that you have access to. It’s neat up there and the rooftop viewing is stunning. I didn’t eat at any of the other restaurants but they were buzzing every time I walked by. Would I return? Yes, the loud music at 2am wouldn’t stop me. This is NEW YORK the city that never sleep. I stayed and the TIME SQUARE area so noise, crowds and craziness is to be expected. ","Toronto, Canada","tojulianna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

The hotel was pretty new and very clean. Staff was really helpful and cheerful. The location couldn't be better since it was our first time in New Your City: It was close to pretty much everything we needed. Walking distance from the subway station and to Penn Station. Also, there is a Dunkin' Donuts just one building away, which made our mornings very easy. We were worried about check in and check out times, but they stored our luggage for free and the process was very easy. We read lots of reviews before booking and a lot of people was complaining about the loud music that comes from the bar on the rooftop, but we stayed on the 6th floor and it was not a problem for us. Yes, we could hear the music some nights, specially on Sunday, but it didn't bother us at all since even the air conditioning noise easily cancelled out the music. We were really excited about the rooftop, but it was not really our vibe: the music was so loud we couldn't talk and people was way too dressed up. The view is nice, though.

It's conveniently located just a couple blocks away from the busting Times Square scene. A lot to do, see, and eat around the hotel. The rooms are cozy, clean and very nicely laid out with all the essentials that you'll need and not more. What I mean is this hotel is not a traditional type of hotel where you have many things and empty spaces that you don't need, which I love because I prefer a cozy room. It can get bit noisy due to the club right next (or on top) of the hotel, but that doesn't really bother me since I am not a light sleeper. The elevators can get crowded especially at nights and during weekends since they reserve at least one of them for the club and restaurant goers. They do need to rethink this situation a bit.

We booked this hotel as part of a package with British Airways before going on to Las Vegas. The staff were really friendly and helpful on check in and we didn’t really have any need to speak to them for the rest of the stay but they were always friendly when we were coming and going throughout the trip. Now the rooms. We stayed on the 6th floor in what I think was a standard double room. It was exceptionally clean and modern and the bed was comfy. However, the bed was tiny, barely a double with a tv on the wall at the foot of the bed. I’m only 5ft5 and my feet almost touched the end of the bed. Anyone much taller wouldn’t fit. There’s no storage space and the floor space was tiny. 2 girls travelling for 10 days we of course had huge cases each and had to strategically plan how we would get ready in the mornings as there wasn’t enough space to have more than one case open at once. We spent a lot of time sitting on the toilet with the lid down as it was the only way we weren’t on top of each other. Luckily we’re long time friends as we were very cozy for the whole of our stay! We actually found it quite amusing and referred to it as our box. The whole reason we booked this hotel was for the roof top bar. We actually never made it during our stay as we couldn’t be bothered to get glammed up after a day out doing sightseeing and opted to go to other bars with more relaxed dress codes.The location is spot on! 5 minutes walk to Times Square and walking distance to most of the other attractions. My only issue was the air con in our room was so noisy and right by our heads when we were sleeping so it did wake us up a few times. All in all I would recommend this hotel, if I was to stay again I would not stay in a standard room unless it was for a night or two as there’s just not enough space!

You can walk just a few minutes to most of the major attractions like Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, etc. The room was very clean and cozy. The rainfall shower was amazing after a long day exploring the city. The room was a bit small, but we only slept there so that was not a big deal. The hotel staff greeted us every time we walked into the lobby. They ofter had free candy waiting and were playing games in the lobby (very cool and fun).

So know ahead what you want out of your hotel.My stay:I arrived sweaty and tired from the airport and was greeted by some hip 20 somethings playing around in the lobby. This 30s business travel felt a bit out of place. It was busy, and instead of one front desk there were several kiosks to check in, making it was difficult to tell who was staying and who worked there. No worry--I had downloaded their app, checked in early, and had a bluetooth card key. Problem was, I couldn't figure out the elevators. It seemed most people couldn't because you had to use your bluetooth key to get upstairs. And my phone's bluetooth wouldn't work for whatever reason.I made it to my floor with staff help, but my phone's bluetooth still wouldn't open the hotel door. So back down I went for a card key. Once finally in my room, I was in love. That waterfall showerhead...good bathroom amenities..the counter space on the sink. This girl was so happy. And the little clothing steamer? Life saver. I've always been an iron gal, but no more. Traveling for work, I had a lot to steam out, and all the pegs made it easy to do the whole lot of clothes at once. My one irritation with the room--so loud in the later days of the week. As the bar traffic below ramped up, it was very audible from a lower floor room. They do have ear plugs in the room (use them!) and my white noise app I was fine. That said, if you need it dead quiet to sleep, this will not be for you.Overall--it's a cool space. I loved the design of the rooms. But the bluetooth phone keys and noise from the bar need some work. If you are in your 20s and plan to be up late, go for it. If you need a quiet retreat after a day out, this will not be for you.","Saint Louis, Missouri","arch_revival</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",0,4.0

Explored the city again and came back to find out the clerk had no idea what we were talking about . Had to grab Andrew again. He straightened it out and comped us more breakfasts. Frankly room was way smaller than first one with 2 double beds, but it all worked. Bottom line, staff needs more training, restaurant is good, but service is sketchy if you don't sit right at the bar. We refilled our own coffees, cleaned our own tables etc. But in the big scheme of things we spent more of our time out of the hotel, so when we were there we were just crashing.

The stay at the hotel was great but the lasting impression I am left with is overall a negative one. I paid for my stay when I arrived at the hotel however when I was paid my wage a week after I checked out of the hotel I had next to no money available. I called my bank and found out that there was a pending charge to Moxy hotel Times Square. The charge is more than I had originally paid for my week at the hotel, almost a full months wage. When calling moxy to inquire the charge the service I have received has been terrible, essentially everyone I have spoken to has apologised but passed the blame on to either my bank or booking.com, who I booked it with. I have been told that the money is some kind of charge that will be paid back into my account after 10 working days. I was not made aware of any such charges when booking or checking in to the hotel. I have been left with almost no money due to this and all I have had from moxy and even Marriott directly is an apology. No explanations as to why the charge was taken and why I wasn’t made aware of the charge and also no attempt to sort the matter has been made. I have booked through Booking.com before and this has never happened, I have stayed at plenty other hotels and again this has never happened before. After being on the phone to Marriott customer service for far longer than an hour all that they have let me know is that they have logged a case. No offers of sorting it sooner and no offer of compensation, which I believe is more than a reasonable ask due to the fact that an unauthorised charged has left me with not enough money to pay my normal bills or even feed myself. I still have no idea why the charge was taken and when my money will be returned to me. Had I been made aware that an additional charge would be made, even a temporary one, I would not have stayed at the hotel as it is entirely unnecessary. Overall the awful service that I have received from this company after a great stay has soured my opinion on the company as a whole. I was planning a return trip to the moxy next timeI travelled to New York however after this hassle and service I will not be going back or recommending to anyone. I don’t want any more apologies from moxy or Marriott, I just want an explanation as to why this has happened and I want the issue sorted.

I read the reviews and thought that a good pair of ear plugs would make a difference as I'm used to sleeping through street noise as I live in London. The noise from the nightclub has to be heard to be believed. Staggeringly, boneshaking levels of noise so absolutely no way even my industrial strength ear plugs could help. In fact, the level was so loud my ears were ringing the following day as if I had been in the club. We are in room 706 so many floors below the nightclub and honestly I have never heard anything like it in my life. And it isn't stopping any time soon. They need to decide what's more important the club or the hotel guests because they can't do both. Every single night, even mid week, booming music until 3am. Seriously, if it wakes up my husband who sleeps like the dead no-one stands a chance of getting any sleep. So if sleeping is an important aspect in a hotel room try elsewhere. Secondly, the check in was as if it was a surprise we were there. Despite this being booked nearly a year ago. In the end, after waiting for a long time they gave us two rooms, two floors apart. Not ideal when your tween kids end up being on their own two floors away.It has quite a few redeeming features but overall the negatives such as the noise far far out weigh what it offers.","West Yorkshire, United Kingdom","Nadine C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Yorkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",99,2.0

This is a new hotel (not even a year old yet!) so everything was nice, clean, and fresh. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with the techy additions to the hotel. The elevator system is a little confusing at first and could be slow at times but overall was not a bad experience.Super close proximity to Times Square, Madison Square Garden, the subway and much more! Very central to the main attractions, which we loved. Went to the rooftop bar called Magic Hour, got in for free since we were staying at the hotel, and had a fantastic time! Beautiful views!I will say that the rooms are fairly small (normal for NYC) and pretty basic. There was no mini fridge and the ice bucket, iron, and a few other small amenities had to be taken from a closet on the floor called ""the stash"" (cute!). There are no ice machines in the hotel so you have to ask the bartender to fill your bucket. Not exactly convenient but it was something we could work with.One fine note which may not relate to many people but while away, my parent's had called the hotel to try and arrange a small surprise for us since it was our 1st year anniversary. They wanted to purchase a bottle of wine from the hotel and have it sent to our room. Every time they called the number provided for the hotel they got the laundry service (who was very nice and patient) and when they finally got through to someone in customer service they were told that they can't do it. A little strange because they have the rooftop bar. It wouldn't be very difficult to charge the bottle to a credit card and have a staff member deliver it.

We spent a little extra to get a suite which was on the 17th floor. Rooms are unique and stylish. Hotel staff are great - helpful and friendly. Even though the roof-top bar was directly above us on next floor, it's really not that loud. I was able to sleep just fine. Others say it's too loud, but it's really not. Yeah you can hear it faintly, but the sounds of honking horns and fire/ambulance sirens are much more audible. The hotel room was very clean. My wife who is likely OCD (by my diagnosis :-), decided to open everything and inspect every corner of the room looking for bugs, dirt, etc. She gave it a A+ so that means the place is really clean. We asked for a late checkout, but the request couldn't be accommodated. Instead, this hotel will store your bag for you after you checkout for a few hours so you can get some more time in exploring the city before you depart! That was awesome! The location of the hotel is great. You're right at 36th and 7th which means you're a 10 minute walk from the epicenter of Times Square. The hotel cost us ~$1,350 USD for 4 days which in Canadian, is like $4 million dollars. Glad my company paid for this trip. Only negative we'd like to mention is the perfume/scent that is pumped into the lobby and elevators. It smells like a mix of fresh-fruit and stripper perfume. Wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so strong.

The rooms were small but smart, power ports where you want them to be, good storage, hook system was such a good idea. For two people, there were two double beds and we even loved the modular cushions + bed = sofa system. However, all of this is foiled by an unimaginable volume of pumping, bass-heavy club coming from the rooftop bar. For at least two of the days of our stay, it went on until 4am. We became acquainted with the listed opening hours of ""MAGIC HOUR"" because it would be an indicator of when we could actually sleep. The ear plugs provided varied in quality (very odd, two different brands for two different requests) - but even ear plugs cannot quell the very potent thump of the bass beat. I am happy about so many things at this hotel - good value, central location, quick access to subway, fast & free WIFI - but not being able to get quality sleep and sharing premises with a night club (just think: lots of bodies in the building at all hours, and a really awful elevator system) takes all of that away.","Sydney, Australia","yeesumx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",42,2.0

I didn't even have a trip advisor account until right now. I made one just so you could know how terrible this hotel is. Avoid the Moxy Times Square at all costs.They seem to put having a hip, cool image ahead of making guests comfortable. If you are looking for a room to stumble back to at 4 AM, wasted out of your mind, this is the place for you. However if you're looking for a good night's sleep and basic amenities, Do Not Stay Here.The rooms are bare bones, and small, which is fine and to be expected. The beds are comfortable enough. But the rooms are missing some things I've come to expect. There is no coffee, no ice buckets or ice, no fridge, no hand lotion, nor extra pillows and blankets. When you check in, they tell you that you can get some of these things from a closet in the hallway on your floor. However, each time I've gone to ""the stash"" as they call it, it had been picked clean. Also, the fact that I have to get dressed and leave my room to get coffee is kind of unforgivable. Its 2018, I mean... come on.My personal experience at this hotel has been awful. it is impossible for me to get a good night's sleep here. The first room I was put in was directly above the bar. It came with earplugs. This, I should have known, was a bad sign. The bass booming through my floor until 4am made it IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. On my third night, I asked to be moved. They didn't have anything in the 'quiet' areas of the hotel, so I was moved to the 17th floor... which is directly under their rooftop bar. It's quieter here, but still so much bass booming all night long. I have earplugs in and it's still absurdly loudI've stayed in half a dozen other times square hotels. I'm not bothered by street noise or people in the hallways or any other normal sort of hotel noise. This, however, is unbearable. I really regret picking this hotel.I want to note that the staff has been nothing but excellent. They did their best to accommodate me, but this hotel is just not my scene and it's not for anyone who expects to sleep at night.This is not a good hotel. It is much more like a college party house. It's designed for the party to go all night and then for people to stumble off to their rooms to pass out. This is not for me. It has been impossible for me to sleep here and I would NEVER stay here again.",,Katie K,2,1.0

Reception were fine & we stored our luggage free of charge because we arrived early. The room was ""small"" (the headboard of the bed touched one wall, the left edge of the bed touched the end wall & the foot end of the bed touched the other wall so in effect the room was 6 feet wide by about 12 feet long; couldn't fully open a suitcase on the floor, without it stopping the door opening & also stopping entrance into the en-suite - OK we thought, it's just for one night & it's clean. The en-suite was good (actually nearly the same size as the bedroom !). After having a drink later in the evening we went back to the room about 11pm - we then noticed two sets of earplugs on a bedside table & a bit later we found out why, woken by incessant music from the nightclub which was somewhere above us I presume. The ear plugs were pretty useless & the fact that they were there signified the hotel must have known about the noise issue - difficult to get any uninterrupted sleep until about 2am when we think the music finally stopped. It wasn't worth ringing reception as I wasn't too keen on having to dress, re-pack & move rooms even if they had one. Next morning breakfast was good.

My husband and I were checked in by a front desk agent I think his name was Jamal, didn’t really look happy to be there. He charged my card 9.59 and didn’t even tell me what it was for until I saw it on my card and asked him; he said it was for the taxes on the room but never said anything on check in, that sounds shady to me. At least explain to me that you’re charging my card and what it’s for. Every day there was a bug, dirt/blood on all of our towels which is unacceptable. The hair dryer in the room was dirty also.

My husband had to use one of the phones outside our room to contact someone to take a look at our lock they fixed it. Then today before we checked out we heard someone knocking on our door at 8am with our DND light on and asked to fix our door. No one communicated with one another that it was fixed last night so we were disturbed very early even with the DND light on.

The service was top notch even on a very busy Sunday afternoon. The food - delicious & plentiful. My only negative would be the comfort level with respect to temperature. This was a hot afternoon. Although there is a cover on the roof, the sides are all open & that is where the tables are set. We were sitting in the scorching sun all afternoon which was not comfortable.

We were in the city to see Harry Potter with our granddaughters and needed a hotel near the theater with four beds. The location was good and the twin bunk quad room was perfect for us.We used the garage right next door to the hotel. I got a promotional code by downloading their app and added an extra hour which came to $55 for 25 hours of parking. We were greeted by a friendly, young staff when we arrived at 11:30 am and although we couldn't check in we did leave our luggage with no problems. When we returned to the hotel between plays our room was ready. We had a corner room on the 7th floor overlooking 7th Avenue. The noise was absolutely no problem as it was minimal. Yes, they do give you earplugs, but I think that everyone gets them and we did not need them. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well.The elevator system worked well once you quickly figured it out. The check in was quick and smooth. We were given four tokens for a complimentary drink at the 2nd floor bar. We had the complimentary prosecco and the girls had sodas. We were able to sit in the second floor lounge area in large comfortable chairs and then we were quickly off to the theater for the show.I would definitely recommend this hotel and suggest that everyone read the information describing the rooms and the size. They are small, compact, and perfectly fine for a stay where you do not plan to hang out in your room. The bathroom door is made of frosted glass and did not give a lot of privacy, but if you choose a small hotel room like this then you wouldn't expect the privacy you would get in a standard hotel room.The service was friendly, quick, and we had absolutely no complaints just compliments for the staff.

We were told we could wait in the lounge until they figured something out and they would call my cell when they were ready. After an hour with no call, I again went to the desk. They clearly had not been working on anything. I stood there until they did something. They gave us three alternate rooms and told us they would move us to our original room the next morning.In the morning, I was told that our new room would be ready in a couple of hours and they would take great care in making sure our luggage was moved to the new room. They would also call my cell when the room was ready. Never received a call. Returned to hotel late afternoon to find that nothing had been done. We ended up moving our luggage ourselves.On third day we returned to our room to find that housekeeping had taken the generous tip I left but they did nothing to the room including not even picking up our wet towels and replacing them. When we returned at 9:00 PM to find the room still not taken care of we called the front desk. They told us that housekeeping had gone home for the day. We pressed them and they ended up sending someone to clean the room while we waited in the lounge at a time when we were tired and ready to go to bed. I had been planning for this trip for months...saving up money since January. It was one of the few times our now grown children would be able to join us. Part of the reason we picked this hotel was that they had a room with four beds we could stay in and we hoped this would be a place we could rest between activities. With all the transitions and problems we ran into, that ended up not happening. We had stayed at Marriott hotels many times in the past and found them to be consistently well done.

Booked 9 nights here with my teen and tween. Leaving after 3 nights to switch to the Hilton Garden Inn. I wanted to love this place, but the quirkiness just tipped over to irritating. The 4 elevators are amazingly efficient if you know how to work them. Unfortunately after traveling 13 hours and getting a 5 minute lecture on all the other hotel amenities, I didn’t understand how to work them upon checkin. No valet service is offered to help you to your room. As the elevator requires you to select your destination from the OUTSIDE and to wave your room card to get both TO your room and BACK to the lobby, it’s possible to find yourself stranded on the 10th floor when your card gets demagnetized and you’re locked out of your room. That didn’t actually happen, but my card did get demagnetized 4 times before I had one that worked both the elevator and my room. (No I didn’t have it near my phone or another card). Good times. I know NYC has smaller hotel rooms and is noisy. But the bunk bed room literally has no place to sit down if you are over 5’3”, because the bottom bunks have a low clearance. There is no chair in the room. And the music from the Magic Hour (4 pm - closing, sometime after 3:30 am when I’m typing this) at the 18th floor rooftop bar reverberates through the empty core of the hotel, waking me from a dead sleep on the 10th floor. The staff is all really nice. So nice they will tell you whatever you want to hear. One was “so concerned” about the noise that they were going to notify the bar to “keep it down.” Hahahaha. I am in a room facing the inside of the hotel. Some rooms face out, so maybe the acoustics are different. I asked to change rooms. The first person I reached was going to “not give up” until I was happy. He transferred me to someone who told me they were full and there was nothing to be done. Bye Felicia. The first morning I was here I got a 7 am wake up call that I didn’t request. (After getting to sleep at 3:30). He apologized for the inconvenience, but definitely seemed to think *I* was the one who had made a mistake, when confirming my room number. Later that day I talked to the front desk and it was still in the computer for the next day. The bathroom is a nice size and the shower is hot with good pressure. The high quality shampoo and conditioner in dispensers was appreciated. The two inch gap between the closed shower door and the wall results in a small flood with every shower. No fan in the bathroom means the humidity in the room is high. AC cannot be set below 68 degrees to help dry things out. There is a magnifying makeup mirror that I loved. Unfortunately the lighting in the bathroom is one bulb in the center of the ceiling, making the application of makeup tricky since your head casts a shadow across said mirror. But I think my favorite part is the bathroom door of almost see-through glass that neither locks nor blocks any sound. My teen son was shocked to discover he could be on his top bunk and pretty clearly see his mother sitting on the John. I tried to capture the noise but my iPhone really doesn’t do the acoustics justice. I think the AC fan took the edge off the noise in the recording, but not so much in reality. Looks like I can’t post video so I’ll just post a pic of my cocktail. The “Got Moxy.” It was really good. The hotel offers no coffee in the lobby or the room. Of course there are multiple restaurants and stores nearby.... but I thought in 2018 a Marriott would have some coffee somewhere. Its 3:45am and the music just stopped. Time for bed!

We booked a double room and got breakfast included through a travel site. The check in process was quick - young girls in t shirts and leggings checking you in on iPads. Elevators operate from the outside which was fine for us but seemed to oddly cause others a lot of confusion. The bedroom was small but very clean and all we needed. The hooks on the walls, small table, cubbies, and USB ports made the entire space functional. Would I have wanted to be here with my 3 kids? No way! But for the two of us, it was just right.We were on the 12 floor and could sort of hear the bar at night but nothing that was an noisier than any other hotel I have stayed in. They do provide earplugs if needed. The air conditioner kicked on and off often, but never did really get cold given leaving it on 68 all day and night. The shower was incredible. I want to stay here again just to take a shower in that incredible waterfall rainshower pure joy experience. Seriously - best shower ever. Breakfast was surprisingly good at the bar on the 2nd floor and there were lots of cozy sitting spaces if you need to spread out a little. Overall, I think this is a great option if you aren’t going to be in your room a lot (and who would be when there are so many things to do outside???). I would suggest a little more info at checkin - I had read about the stash but no one told me where it was or what was in it. I just had to go exploring when I needed more pillows. This hotel also has a very young vibe. We felt a little old when in the elevators - we are mid-40s and were nearly 2x the age of everyone else staying and working in the hotel. I don’t really care but I could see someone feeling out of place. Also - the art is weird. I really wish someone could explain to me what the art above our bed was supposed to represent :) ","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","laceyt1979</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",11,4.0

It's actually quite a small foyer with no furniture at all, but the 2nd floor has lots of comfy seating areas and a couple of bars to relax in. There's also the rooftop bar if you feel like splashing out on an expensive cocktail or two. Not cheap but worth at least one visit. Rooms are small but have everything you need, including a clothes steamer which came in handy. My only criticism was that the air con was too noisy to leave on at night as it kept us awake. We soon worked out that if we needed extra pillows, towels etc we had to visit the ""stash"" cupboard.Like I said, not your average hotel.Staff were really friendly and helpful (found us one of the quieter rooms when we requested it) and the free bottles of water at the front door were really appreciated and sometimes there was a big jar of free candy too.It's not actually on Times Square, but that's a good thing, as it's close enough without being in the thick of it and meant we could actually get some sleep. A short walk to Penn Station meant we could take the train to JFK airport, which is cheaper and quicker than a cab.I think it's definitely aimed at the younger end of the market, but my friend and I were celebrating turning 50 and didn't feel out of place.

I had seen other hotels with bunk beds, but as someone over 35+, I wasn't exactly wanting to sleep in a twin bunk bed for any length of time. I loved the room I found at the Moxy with the queen bed and a bunk over. It looked comfortable for the amount of time I was spending in NYC. I do wish they had mentioned the time of day that under 21 was not allowed on the rooftop. I would have planned better so that the family could have enjoyed the mini golf. My only beef with the hotel was the floor in my room - it was gross. I called to have it cleaned on Saturday and I could tell the room had been tended to while I was out. However, if the floor had been cleaned, it was not obvious. My guess is that the floor had been destroyed by a prior guest and not able to be repaired. It looked like wax had been spilt on the floor and a large bag of garbage had been pulled across the floor staining the floor boards. It really was quite nasty. I was overall pleased with my stay because the hotel is very cool and super conveniently located. The 'this is the last room available of the kind you booked' is fine, but attention should have been paid to the actual room. And in most other chains, if there isn't a room available based on your reservation, they typically upgrade for free. I suppose that might not have been available while I was there, but that floor...I wouldn't call it uninhabitable, but I sure don't mind sharing that it was gross and should be replaced before someone else stays. Otherwise, I doubt this will be the last review about the gross floor.","Arlington, Virginia","kateinvirginia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",2,4.0

I’ve been a few times and it’s great every time. LOVE the location - an easy walk from GCT, and in the heart of the fashion district on top of Herald Square and Macy’s.The second floor bar is great and, every time I’ve been there at least, not crowded. Cocktails are good - but stay away from the free one. It was some awful premixed sugar bomb. The second floor bar has a small food selection, but if you want to keep it basic, the flatbreads are quite good as is the breakfast. They also have a grab and go located there, which is very convenient. The rooms are what make this place, in my opinion. They feel like glamping. It’s not for everyone, for sure, but I love it. They are on the small side (typical for NYC) but high marks for how functional they make the space. For example, there are camp stools and a table hanging on the wall and there are storage cubbies under the bed. So, the bathroom: some people may find this weird but the sink is outside of the bathroom in the hallway area of the room. In the bathroom itself is the toilet and tiled standup shower, which is actually very roomy. Again, I don’t mind the setup one bit, but some people might not like it.The ONLY thing I don’t like about this hotel is the rooftop bar. It is insanely packed and the one time it wasn’t when we were up there, nearly every table was on reserve, even though it was early evening.

The price is right for its plum location and the rooms although small are well appointed with lots of amenities. But what I liked most about this hotel was is excellent customer service which was prompt, professional and always with a smile. From the front desk to housekeeping and the serving staff, all were excellent. There where a few suggestions that I will post here as constructive criticism, but I am not going to take off points because my overall experience was so good. I would recommend a small closet and or a chest of drawers in the room instead of the wall pegs that serve as clothes hangers. Also, a coffee maker in the room would help sleepy heads like me get a start on their day. Finally, I checked in late on a Friday night and the party scene was in full swing. As I was going up to my room, there was a drunk riding the elevator who was belting out the tunes from 'The Sound of Music' way off key. Luckily he got off on a lower floor to the relief of the other guests. I know this is something that management can't always control, but it's important to make them aware of the situation since there where many families staying at the hotel. Also, some of the guests myself included, had trouble using the elevator cards, so perhaps making them more user friendly couldn't hurt. Other than that, I had a great time and would recommend this hotel to those traveling on a budget.","Houston, Texas","satorotas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",26,5.0

I decided to stay in The MOXY because at the time of my booking it was one of the cheapest hotels i could find that fit my criteria in regards to location. i was not disappointed what so ever. This hotel is amazing. The marriot is the mother company of this hotel and you could definitely tell! The attention to detail is amazing. i stayed in the basic double room. Yes it was small but if you expect to travel to NYC and receive a large room at any hotel you are going to be disappointed wherever you go. Even though the room is small, the use of space is incredible. the little holes under your bed and the hanger space is very funky, the SHOWER IS AMAZING and the bed is very comfortable. Yes the aircon is a touch noisy but its bearable and its actually very easy to fall asleep to the noise. i read reviews about the noise from the parties they hold on the rooftop bar... believe me there was no issue with this noise at all, don't be put pff by those reviews because you couldn't hear a thing! and i was fairly close to the 18th floor; its a very quiet hotel! The soundbar in the room is a nice touch and the Tv has the capability of netflix so its cool to be able to watch whatever you want after a long day of walking in NYC. Location is top notch. close to 34th/Penn station and far enough out of times square that you don't have to deal with the noises of the city but one stop away on the subway so its easy to get to if you want to spend the night in times square. The hotel bar and open space is amazing and the hotel has definitely succeeded in making the second floor lounge somewhere that you want to spend some time. Bar is well priced and welcome cocktail was a nice touch. Jessica in the bar area is amazing and really attentive to you, as are all the staff, they are young, vibrant and charismatic. The only frustration i had was the rooftop bar. it was over the top, as a hotel guest spending nearly $2k on this hotel for the week i didn't expect to have to jump through hoops and be spoken to by security the way i was just to get up there, its as if the security think the kardashians are on that rooftop 24/7 it was unnecessary and it changed the whole vibe of the hotel from being a small boutique quirky hotel into something that was unwelcoming and the staff seemed to think you were an inconvenience. its a nice space but i don't understand why its so hard to get a table or service. i preferred the second floor, and i left the rooftop about 10min into my stay to go back to the second floor where i enjoyed my night much more than i ever would on that rooftop it has much the same products for less money. it was probably the only disappointing part of the stay. i actually cannot recommend this hotel enough!

The hotel is trying to be very hip and cool in all things ranging from the way the room is arranged to the lobby to the elevators, but it misses things that a traveler needs.Like many people, I believe, I have a toiletries bag, yet there is really no place to just put it down on a counter in the bathroom. I had to move it back and forth between the toilet cover and the edge of the sink. They would be well served to put in a shelf or something.The room itself was small (fine, it's NYC, I get that), but the luggage stand was too small and too wobbly to truly support my bag. The steamer (instead of the iron) was ok, but the big issue for me was the temperature. It was either freezing or way too hot.Little things like the Chromecast to the TV (which was promoted didn't work because it was on a different wi-fi network and couldn't be access) don't matter all that much, but were minor irritants.I found the staff to be very nice and the workout room was great, but between the noise outside my window and the noise outside my door (I was right near the elevator), it led to a pretty bad sleeping experience which was not good given that I had a big meeting the next day.If you are a vacation traveler and you prefer style over substance, the Moxy is for you.

Although this experience was much better than the Chicago one and they did have irons to use in ur room from the floor “Stash” rooms. Read the reviews at each level from poor to great. It’ll tell you what you need. As with the last one I reviewed, if you were/are a Hostel kind of person and have more money to spend, I’d say this is you brand of hotel. Very trendy. The rooms are tastefully decorated, though extremely small if ur 6’3” like me. See picture. The layout is weird and it’s geared to get you to go to the public hang out space. Not my thing as I travel 45+ weeks a year. The rooftop bar was loud and I was several floors below as is the AC fan mentioned in several reviews, but they said that when I checked in and there were ear plugs in the room. Not really for me though, kind of weird sleeping with them and normally I can sleep in NY even with normal noise. You basically have to sit on the bed or a little stool of you want to read or watch TV. And all the public spaces are packed and super loud like at a mini club. As a lifetime platinum elite member who’s stayed at every brand of Marriotts, this just isn’t one I’m going to contour to use. BUT read the reviews if it piques your interest even a little, you’ll probably love it. The decor alone was an actual treat. If you want plenty of interaction opportunities in the place ur staying, this is it, especially if you want a younger crowd. Anyway, I can appreciate the demographic the brand is geared toward, but I don’t believe it’s really a long term seasoned travelers brand.

We checked in, found water on the floor of our sixth-floor room. Tried calling front desk(s) and twice phone was picked up and immediately hung up.Ok.....Went to lobby, was told, quite apologetically that we would be moved to a ""much nicer"" room. Sent to an identical room on the 14th floor (I should have refused, knowing there was a bar on the 18th floor rooftop). Loud noise until 4 a.m. -- so much for ""much nicer.""Incredibly cramped layout of furniture which, oddly, wasn't really the problem. We liked the room. The problem was just a series of dumb inconveniences, from the free ""specialty drink"" not being available (bait and switch?) to not being able to get a human to answer the phone for more than an hour when one of our party forgot her key and would not be able to access the elevators.An aside: coffee, tea and pre-packaged baked goods are not ""breakfast."" Even if it's free.So it comes down to this: the staff at the Moxy is perhaps the worst-trained I have ever encountered in any place, anywhere. Granted, they all seem friendly and want to help but don't seem to have a clue as to what a basic level of professionalism might be.I know the manager or whomever will reply to this and say ""Oh we're so sorry you did not have an awesome experience,"" but I would just hope that something will be DONE ABOUT it for future guests (I will not be among them).Honestly, I have run across hotel clerks in Marriott level 3 hotels with more service acumen than this crew.

I think it would be fine if you were single or with your partner. I say this because the when someone is in the shower or toilet you can see through the diving partition and so there is no privacy at all. I had to shower in the dark to offer me that privacy. The rooms are decorated very nice, but it is bare bones. There is no closet, so you have to get use to hanging your clothes up on pegs that are around the room. A lot of other things like getting ice is a hassle as you have to go to a closet to get an ice bucket, and then go all the way to the bar on the second floor to get the ice. I was also in an ADA room and it did not meet code whatsoever ie. the shower base had a curb and ADA rooms should have no curb so that you can roll a chair straight into the shower. My biggest gripe was that i had some money on me that i was going to change a few days later at the airport in to a different currency. I know i should of been more careful but you would like to think that money that is hidden in a bag and not on display would be safe. Needless to say i had a lot of money (340$) stolen out of my bag.

When you enter you get a feel for just how cool this place is when you see games like Jenga and corn hole set up in the lobby. The rooms were small but I guess that expected in NYC and regardless the room had everything that was needed. It was super clean and quiet which you never would have guessed from all the activity in the lobby and on the streets in general. The staff were super friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out and every need in between.

That being said it is New York City and I guess that’s what you should expect. The price wasn’t completely out of this world and the convenience of the location was 2nd to none. I wanted to catch a lot of theatre whilst I was in New York and I was only about a 10 minute walk from most of the major productions and theatre venues. It was great being on such convenient subway lines to so made it very easy getting around Manhattan. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, I had a few bits and pieces that I needed their help with such as suggestions of local laundromat services, printing off boarding passes and work documents.Although my room was small it was very cleverly designed to fit a lot into a small space. My double queen was definitely only big enough for one person, just wasn’t enough space for two peoples luggage. The rooms were very funky and had a cool design and had been newly renovated.The only downside that was when I was staying, every night at 1 AM major construction occurred on the road directly outside the hotel entrance by the City. Obviously the hotel staff couldn’t do anything about this but no attempt was made to apologise for the disruption or in anyway make up for it. Luckily I had a fantastic silicon gel earplugs so generally wasn’t disturbed but that wasn’t the case for many other hotel guests. As it was New York Pride that weekend, all hotel rooms were booked so it wasn’t possible to move me or anyone else.Although my experience was generally positive the size of the hotel rooms was definitely a problem for me personally. If you’re not bothered by this sort of thing then this is a great hotel for you but I just need a little bit more space…","Los Angeles, California","ruars1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",10,3.0

Was worried about other reports of noise from the club - we were on 12th floor and it was fine. If you like the photos on the website and minimalist rooms, you'll love it.

And that is saying. A lot. Funky hangers can’t hold your shirts and absolutely no table to sit. Only a bed. The only way to iron any clothes is to put the tiny table top ironing board (no table here) on the floor and hope you don’t get your clothes dirty (see pic). With platinum status I thought I would get an upgrade (they said I did at checkin but didn’t happen). All I got was “sorry”. No help even. Just “sorry”. In their defense I know this hotel is catered to the younger crowd (I’m only 40), but lack of simple amenities makes it a poor choice for anyone who is coming on business.

The thought that went into the use of every inch of this room is unsurpassed. From the door - which you can unlock with your phone and has a button to push for DND instead of a hang sign and 2 different safety locks, to the hooks that line one whole side of the room in lieu of a closet - the hooks do not have sharp points and there are hangers and such if you need them (as well as a steamer instead of an iron in the room), to the beds with comfortable mattresses and no dumb bedspreads - only fully washable bedding - we got a room with a Queen and a Twin bunk and it was brilliant use of space with storage cubbies underneath a platform bed instead of a boxspring, to the bean bag chair tucked in the corner and the tv tray to work or eat on since there is no desk, the room doesn't miss a detail.

We came here for 4 days during 4th of July week, and decided to reduce our stay to 1 night only. Not only the hotel was dishonest to us about their being a quiet hotel (I specifically requested for a quiet room in a quiet hotel), and yes I travel to NYC often for work and pleasure, and I am not asking for nirvana, but the fact that they did not disclose to me beforehand that there is a party for 2 nights in a row until 4am because of 4th of July is concerning. Why did not they tell me about it? I specifically requested and VALIDATED twice before I came here, and they assured me. Why was the planned party on the roof top not disclosed? The AC is also very loud in the room. I asked their engineer to come and he said there's no way to reduce the power of the fan, because the setting is either on (which is very loud) and at full speed, OR automatic, which is on and off, but still very loud when it is on. I stayed at room 1229 first , and the rooftop party was on 18th floor, and they put me there without telling me or alerting me that there'd be noise until 4am from the rooftop. NONE. They just stole from me, and wanted my business. I am surprised that hotel business can be as sneaky as that. I called at 11pm and asked to be moved to a much more quiet room. Someone named Kitty (not sure if it is the correct spelling or not) picked up the phone. She was polite, but not helpful, and we had a lot of back and forth because I asked her specifically what made me her think that moving me to 8th floor (room 814 specifically) would guarantee a better experience for me, because I wanted to know that first before making a decision whether or not I wanted to move. I thought this was a fair ask. Why would one make a decision without knowing all of the facts first ?! She could not answer right away, as she was just a middle man so to speak, and the front desk had to make the call, so there was a couple back and forth between me, Kitty, and the front desk, until finally a front desk person named Drew, who was quiet rude by the way and hung up on me, explained why he would think room 814 which is on the 8th floor could be better. Next time, clarify and be more transparent to your guests, particularly to your top guests like platinum guests. I don't expect to give this hotel anymore business, and I will tell all my friends and my business colleagues to avoid this particular hotel going forward. They are not professional, and more importantly they lack good work and business ethic.","Chicago, Illinois","jetsetasianboi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",21,1.0

It was not large but adequate and I don't spend a lot of time in my room. Pluses:1. WiFi was the fastest I have ever witnessed in a hotel.2. Love the fact you press a button that changes your exterior room number light to yellow, signalling that you don't want to be disturbed. A much better system than hanging something on the door, which can fall off, get turned around or get taken.3. Elevators are fast as there are 4 of them and they are designed to optimize who gets in what elevator. 4. Great location. Minuses:1. It was annoying having to always crawl over the bed to adjust the blinds. It would have been much better if they had provided a fixed wall control (vs a remote control which only would get lost, broken)l. Would it really have cost that much more to provide that? 2. The master switch beside the door, which is a great idea as it both saves electricity and avoids having to run around and turn off all the room lights, ironically does not turn off the bathroom/shower light. This seems like a HUGE oversight.3. The sink was wide enough, ie left to right, but not deep enough front to back. Trying to wash your face in the morning in it results in water splattering on the floor. They could have installed one with a bit of a concave front to allow a bit more space. 4. The elevator music is blaring and obviously is not going to be to everyone's liking. Quieter and more 'easy-listening' music would be better.5. The wide-screen TV is not adjustable so when you are sitting at the table and char (that you take off the hooks on the wall if you so desire) you have to look at it at a real angle. I would have had the TV hung on a thick piece of plywood and have had hinges on the right side so you could swivel it like a door and get a better view from the chair. This would have been super cheap and easy to have done. 6. I agree with the comments about noisy. Music is blaring everywhere. It's a bit much. Having said all that I would stay there again.","Toronto, Canada","5starbudgetguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

Also, I was told I was given an upgrade (Platinum status).Aside from the extremely small room, it's a nice hotel. Evidently, the brand is aimed at millennials. I'm a suburban Gen X dad, but I enjoyed the vibe and the decor. The location is good if you business in that part of town or want to be near MSG / Penn Station. I grabbed a coffee and croissant at a Pretty a Manger just outside the hotel.

Given some of them we arrived slightly apprehensive.. in short we needn’t have been it’s fab ! There were negative reviews about the noise one saying don’t stay in a floor above floor 7 can you imagine how we felt when we were given floor 16 but to tired from traveling to argue we decided to wait till next day to discuss . We never did have to discuss it not a peep of noise was heard and that was over the weekend. The reviews about lack of cupboard space .. yes there are no cupboards but there is a large row of clever hooks some with coat hangers on more than sufficient to hang all your clothes also storage space under bed . The review saying no hot water in shower .. the shower was my favourite part massive with loads of hot water anytime of day .The review about lack of an iron ( really ! ) there was a quirky hand held steamer that did the job better than most hotel irons iv used . Finally the review saying don’t go if you are over 50 ! Well we are and still loved it so many people our own age or older none of whom seemed concerned to be there . In summary the Moxy is a modern spotlessly clean hotel that makes clever use of the space available. It is located in the heart of Time Square and a five minute walk from Penn Station . It has a lovely bar area as well as seating area and a roof top bar .. what more do you want ! Look forward to going back .,,CarolineH2403,3,5.0

So, myself and 3 friends booked this hotel as we wanted somewhere in a great location and that offered something a bit different. We booked a room with 2 bunk beds which was fine for 5 nights since we didn’t plan on spending much time in our room anyway apart from sleeping. I have to say we were all really pleased, the room looked exactly as it did in the pictures, clean, modern and fresh. We knew what we were getting in terms of size so that was no issue at all. All seemed fine and the staff were really friendly and helpful, especially the girl who checked us in, think her name was Ashleigh. The facilities were superb, a great little touch was ‘The stash’ which was a cupboard with extra towels and irons and ironing boards etc which guests could help themselves to. So far so good!However, it all went wrong on day 2 when I discovered that $250 had been stolen from my zipped up rucksack. Yes, I know, there’s a safe in the room but I certainly didn’t expect anything like this to happen! I reported it and security took down a report etc but still to this day I have not received any kind of apology or explanation. It’s pretty obvious that a cleaner had rummaged through our bags and helped themselves. It’s obviously my word against there’s and there’s not really anything I can do about it but as you can imagine, this incident cast a shadow over the whole stay. If it hadn’t been for this I would have rated it much higher because everything about it worked perfectly for our stay but the fact is you can’t trust the staff which is pretty poor! Everything else about the hotel is great though and although a lot of reviews have complained about the noise from the bars we didn’t have any issues at all but then I did request a room to be as far away from noise as possible so that’s worth thinking about. I’ve no doubt you’d have a great stay here but make sure you lock EVERYTHING valuable away that you can!! I’ve learned my lesson and I feel really let down by the hotel but I guess that’s life. I definitely won’t be staying here again though simply for that reason.",,Justjustin78,2,3.0

The elevators are dark and uninviting but our room was fun with a funky, young vibe. We weren’t able to check out the rooftop bar, sadly, as they wouldn’t allow children in, not even for a quick look. We didn’t want to leave them alone so we had to forego that one. Our room was newly decorated, funky and young in design and decor, and very small, but adequate. The whole vibe just made me smile ... especially the bedtime stories option on the phone. The lobby was decked out with a hopscotch outline, hacky sack games and fun colours and vignettes. No chairs or seats of any kind however, which would be helpful. Our precooked shuttle failed to arrive for our return to the airport, which caused me a bit of stress at check out time. A new one arrived, 25 minutes later, thankfully!

The bathroom was ok size and for a two day stay it was doable. There is no where to set your stuff so it all has to be hung up on a row of hooks on the wall. So, if you want more room be sure to ask for it.The other thing was my wife had secretly planned a nice birthday dinner up in the Moxy resturant. Before that I was to walk into our room with ballons and champagne. Surprise! No they were not there. The hotel had forgotten. And no reservation for dinner. The lady was really nice and scrambled to get things together and get us a table upstairs but it was already late. So, we walked across the street and had my 50th Birthday dinner at the Irish Pub.

I had some unpleasant words for the bartender Nina. The hotel restaurant Legasea, would do so much better if they fired or retrain the bartender Nina, and the restaurant manager Alexis. They need a comprehensive lesson in Hospitality. It’s a shame, because the hotel is funky, cool, fun, the restaurant Legasea has great food & cocktails, but some of the staff members have no business in the hospitality industry. I don’t recommend this hotel to anyone. I predict that if this Hotel does not train their staff accordingly, this hotel will not survive. I just call it how I see it. I’ve never had such a horrible experience in the many Hotels I stay at, like I’ve had at this hotel. We’ll see if they shape up a year from now.","New York City, New York","TheGustoExperience</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,1.0

It hadn't opened when we booked it and when the reviews started coming in saying there were problems with the room sizes and noise we were a bit worried.We needn't have been. From arrival to leaving we could not fault them. We had emailed them in advance asking for a low floor (away from the club noise) and a room with the tv facing the bed and also that it was our 20th wedding anniversary.Got to our room.... on the 11th floor with a tv side on to the bed in what can only be described as snug. My heart did sink a bit but when my hubby showed me the tv was on a cantilever hinge I was ok. The room, although small was perfect, and as long as I had a comfy bed and a decent shower I was happy and I'd heard these were perfect.We were given two tokens each for free cocktails which we got from the bar on the 2nd floor. Very impressed with the bar area, also has a relaxed but funky lounge area to sit in with street views. There was a DJ there playing fabulous tunes, I was almost reluctant to leave. The day after arriving was our Anniversary so we went out exploring NY and went for a meal we'd pre booked, not getting back till around 9pm. We opened the door and our room was decorated with balloons and flower petals. It was such a surprise and made our day feel extra special. I don't know who did it but thanks to the moxy crew, it was a lovely touch.The bed was v comfy, we were reluctant to get out of in the morning and the shower is fabulous. The maid came every day although there is an option to refuse.There was a stash cupboard that supplied toiletries, which was brilliant as I'd forgotten my razor. No charge. You could also help yourselves to extra pillows and towels, such a good idea.We were up and out by 8am every day, grabbing two egg and cheese muffins for $3 at the Dunkin donuts next door, very handy when you're out and about. If we were back at the hotel before too late we could grab a handful of sweets and a bottle of water (free) before they were put away. We tried out the rooftop bar on one of our evenings, we went up early before the crowds and managed a game of crazy golf and drank our drink on the carousel with views of the ESB, fabulous. It's free for hotel guests but others have to pay an entrance fee. The drinks up there are pricey but we only went for one. On our last day we checked out at 12 ( very respectable) and we were able to use the luggage room for free until we left for the airport. You were given a ticket for each bag/case and its manned so no worries about leaving your luggage unattended. Can honestly say this hotel is fabulous. Yes it's got a vibe that is possibly aimed at the younger traveller, the fun and funky elements in the decor, the basketball in the lobby, the music, the rooftop bar, but don't let this put you off if you feel too old. There's a real mix of ages, nationalities and clientele but that's what makes it fun. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Moxy crew.

We had just come from a long European trip, with four cases between us, and the room was not ""quite"" big enough for all of us … We had to keep one case in the bathroom, for example. ;-) (I did find out LATER that they have luggage storage …) The bed was on a platform, with no way to get in from either side (one side against the wall), so it was a bit challenging for ""old folks"". Small table and small stools folded and hung on the wall. Not a lot of space for ""stuff"". There were so many other fun little elements to the place ….

Over the course of our entire nine day stay, our room was cleaned twice.

Tip, do not 'double order' the lift, you'll know what I mean when you find yourself standing around for ten minutes waiting for a lift to pick you up.7) The bed provided was one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced, big plus there.I wish I could say the positives were enough to make me want to stay again but the sheer fact that an additional charge was taken from us, without being informed, and has still not been rectified, leads us with a very sour taste to be honest.

I would consider this hotel again but maybe for a shorter stay and definitely requesting a lower floor room. I think the management need to decide what's most important to them - the rooftop club or the hotel patrons. Maybe they could relaunch the club for a different more laid back clientele with a less frenetic play list :-) ","Newcastle, United Kingdom","MrDigzz62</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, United Kingdom</strong>",39,4.0

Excited to be in NYC and all wide-eyed whilst also sleep-deprived, check in was easy even if it was by a rookie under supervision, our room, lift use instructions and token for a free drink in hand was simple. No stuffy desk receptionist and big queues here. Up on the 17th floor room 1703 has no view, not even into the central atrium, blinds are permanently down to ensure privacy from our neighbour’s adjoining window at a 90 degree angle and everyone else just a few meters away. Also there is little or no furniture to speak of. Instead of a wardrobe or built in hanging space - we were booked in for a week - pegs line the wall and so we decorated our room with our clothes. Not a good look. The double bed is great, the en suite is accessible with hand rails and spacious. All ok really, though the blinds piss me off, I can live with it. We check in on a Monday and spend 3 glorious fun packed days exploring NYC. Wednesday evening however is noticeable because from about 10pm, directly above us we hear banging house music. We feel royally annoyed that no mention anywhere was made to this fact. The earplugs provided offer no protection. 12.10am and I call the crew to be told this is on until 2am and then it’s a busy weekend with parties until 4am. I’m given apologies that we were not told, apologies not accepted and I’m told we can ask for a move in the morning. We speak with John first thing, he tells us we can pack up and leave our bags at reception and there should be room by 4pm - nothing showing at that time. We go eat breakfast and pack and when we go down with all our things we have to explain again as John isn’t there. Our crew member says there is a room available on a lower floor and says it’s a queen room so it’s an upgrade. Have to say they are helpful and sorry for our discomfort. However, our room in 723 is half the size and to say this is disappointing is an understatement. The bed is accessible from one side only. The few things I’ve taken out of our cases make our room look like a thrift store and the hand basin is outside the shower room, taking up more space so that we are excusing ourselves to get by. Basically, it’s a single occupancy room set up for one/two night stays. Had we known the impact the rooftop bar would have had to our comfort, I’d have made sure we were below 10th floor - the music is a distant, occasional noise from the 7th. Had they told us in person on check in or made mention of the bar playing loud music we would have thought twice about booking it. It’s clean, stylish, crew are friendly but not coordinated enough to deal with our moans.Seems to me this place is more like a trendy roof top bar with accommodation rather than a hotel. If I was 25 years younger I’d have more sense than to spend my money here. Older doesn’t always mean wiser.

Biggest annoyance was lack of wardrobe space - we had to hang our clothes up around the room - not ideal. We come to the city a lot and have found it frustrating that simple things at the Moxy are not quite right. Firstly it’s been a Hot humid week in the city and clearly the air con systems are not up to scratch as we had to move rooms as our unit stopped working. Second room was bigger - great - but again air con not working so was really sticky in the room and had to have all the windows open. Secondly they won’t take cash on check out so had to load the credit card. They also took two lots of charge for the room - preauthorisation for any charges, but again no idea when this will come off. Another thing to mention is the rooftop bar is disappointing. We did go up one night but there’s no where to sit unless you pay a minimum bottle charge ($600) and the bar takes ages to be served. If you want a decent rooftop experience head to 230 Fifth where there’s loads of seating and happy hour from 2pm TIL 7pm.

But as many other reviewers have noted, you need to understand that the target audience of the hotel is toward Millennialls and make sure it works for you.My purpose in staying at the hotel was to save some money on my semi-annual business trips to Manhattan. Hotel rooms in NYC routinely run over $400 for mid level hotels. So when I heard about the Moxy concept and price point (~$200/night), I thought I'd give it a try.To begin with, I did save the money I hoped to. I typically stay down near 24th Street at a Hilton Property and by staying at the Moxy I saved over $180/night for three nights. I'll take the ~$500 savings every time. My stay was from Sunday to Wednesday so I did miss the notoriously loud weekends.The hotel is focused on being hip/trendy for the Millennial crowd. Lobby is sparse with a chic vibe where several check-in kiosks are staffed by employees. Second floor is the communal area which includes couches, tables and high-tops to spread out and work, get a bite to eat or have a drink at the bar in the evening.The hotel rooms are very small. You definitely need to know that before making a reservation. I have also stayed at a POD Hotel and thought the Moxy's room was a little bit nicer. The bed was comfortable, there was a small sink in the room versus in the bathroom, and hooks along one wall as there is no closet. My one room complaint was about the hooks - almost half of them were over the TV or the sink, etc. Therefore functional hanging space for suit/dress shirts was at a premium. There was an in-room steam iron which was handy for getting my clothes looking nice for meeting. Having stayed at the POD Hotel and small rooms in Europe, the room was fine for my purposes. But definitely look at the pictures to make sure it suits your travel needs.Regarding the noise - I came in knowing it could be loud from the many reviews noting as such. I thought Sunday - Wednesday would be quieter. It was quiet on Monday and Tuesday night. But Sunday there was a raging party on the second floor and the music was loud up until 3:00 a.m. On the 5th floor I could hear the DJ word for word. The hotel does provide ear plugs and somehow I slept okay the first night, but a party lasting that long on a Sunday night is kinda ridiculous. I realize who the hotel is marketing to, but I think the hotel, the Moxy brand and Marriott could benefit from focusing more on the hotel guests rather the party atmosphere - at least Sunday through Thursdays.I am planning on staying here again for business trips as the savings are worth the small issues. I also think Marriott is missing the boat on business travelers. Many of us just need a place to sleep and don't want to drop $400 - $500 per night in Manhattan and/or don't want to stay in New Jersey to save a few dollars. Focusing on business travelers mid-week and younger travelers on the weekend seems like the best of both worlds. Mid week (Sunday - Thursday) the music should stop at midnight. Otherwise the location, nightly rate proximity to Penn Station and trendy vibe make for a good place I plan on staying at in the future.","Sacramento, California","TravelTripin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",36,4.0

It is a hotel with a party vibe and the decor is very hipster. We got the room with 2 double beds and it was sooo comfy. The room is quite small but I don’t think it needs to be bigger as it adds to the coziness. The only reason we noticed is because we had a lot of luggage.The hotels location is flawless, easy access to anywhere with Subway and Uber. Of course it’s within walking distance of Times Square too. The roof top bar is also a bonus, I got the alcoholic cupcakes and they were HUGE for the price.The free drinks tokens were great. Play about with the in room phones and they give you phrases to say at the bar for free cocktails.The only major downside to the stay was that our shower was was faulty meaning it was dripping quite loudly all throughout the night. They tried to fix it but it was still broken. As our stay was so short it wasn’t even worth moving rooms.I would highly recommend this hotel to young travellers but its draw may be lost on the older generations.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","StaceyMichelleSmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",16,4.0

We arrived at Penn Station and were able to easily walk a few blocks with a large suitcase each. The checkin process was fast and all the employees were helpful. The lobby is full of oversized games like connect 4 and Jenga, but the lobby air-freshener will knock you out. I got used to it after a few days. The room was tiny, but functional. It was very tight ,and because my pocketbook is the size of a small duffle bag I had to hang it in the shower (see photo). There are no closets in the room, just hooks. The side table and chair are collapsed and hung on the wall because there is simply not enough room (see photo). The video we uploaded on FB was absolutely hysterical of us trying to move around in this tiny space, but we powered-through. I must say that the shower was THE BEST shower ever! I know that sounds crazy, but it is literally all we talked about at breakfast with the other folks who stayed at the hotel. The water pressure was unbelievable and the rainfall shower head was the BEST. There is a very large common area in the center of the building that is very comfortable with lots of great seating options for groups and loners. The bar is also located in this area. At night, this place is quite the little hot spot. Good music and cool people. I really enjoyed the people watching during out stay. This floor also has prepared food available, which includes one of the best fruit salad I ever had. Seriously, everywhere I went in NY had the best fruit. We didn't get an opportunity to visit the rooftop bar because it didn't open until evening and there were private events every night we stayed. That was a little disappointing.The elevator was annoying. You must press your floor before the elevator arrives. Then the elevator tells you which door to use (number 3). We missed the elevator several times because we were quick enough. At times I felt like I was on a hidden camera show. lol Overall, I liked this place. It is not a luxury hotel and we knew that going into this, but we felt like we were getting a real NY experience. I loved the convenient location in mid-town Manhattan. Everyone staying at the hotel was nice and I would be perfectly comfortable staying here again.","Annapolis, Maryland","usherjodi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annapolis, Maryland</strong>",18,4.0

Check-in was smooth and we found all of the associates we dealt with to be very friendly and professional. The lobby had a very fresh, updated look and was very user friendly. My room was on the 7th floor. I liked the unique layout of the room – 2 double beds end to end against one wall. The bed was super comfy. There is no closet or dresser. Instead there are hooks on the wall (evenly spaced – it’s a nice design feature) and underbed storage. If you are the kind of person that likes to unpack and settle in, this might be awkward, but I was living out of my suitcase, so I was ok with it. The air conditioner was very loud, but I didn't mind that as it acted as white noise (I didn't hear any street noise or noise from the bar upstairs at all). However, there was no additional chair or small table in my room - I thought that there was supposed to be. I wasn’t in the room much, so it didn’t matter, but if there had been others with me, it would have been nice to have that chair. The bathroom in my room was HUGE! I liked all of the space, but I would have appreciated a bigger counter in the bathroom to put my toiletries. Also, the 2 sided mirror was a nice touch, but the lighting around the bathroom sink was terrible so I could not use the mirror for putting on my makeup. The window shades in my room did not go up, so I was unable to get any natural light. And I was a little freaked out that the deadbolt lock in my room did not work. These were all small things, but they did add up to raising my annoyance level a bit. I really liked Bar Moxy. It's a great space to hang out, with big comfy lounging areas and some games (jenga, a foosball table, etc.). Went in the evening and got the “welcome” cocktail. Also ate there for breakfast. Service was a bit slow, but the staff was very friendly. Overall I liked the hotel.

As it’s located on 7th Avenue the hotel is perfect for a short walk to Times Square and lots of other iconic attractions. The hotel it’s self is super trendy; there are 6/8 kiosks instead of normal hotel desks, there was great music being played and the staff (crew!) were very friendly. You are given your key card which you put into the elevator and using a touch screen select which floor you are going to, the screen then displays what elevator you should use which is either P1, P2, P3 or P4 (they are all right next to each other in the lobby) we were on the 3rd floor in room 325. The room it’s self was very small (but not small enough to put us off returning) but had everything; double bed, floor length mirror, shower, toilet & sink. The sink was outside the bathroom it’s self which was strange but fine! There was a flat screen TV on the wall facing the bed, there was a fold away table and 2 fold away chairs which when not being used were hung on the wall (very quirky and space saving!) there is no drawers or wardrobes, instead a few hangers from a pole on the wall. The bed was pushed up against a wall and was the full length of the room which meant if you were sleeping on the far side, you have to crawl over the other person to get out of it but again, not a huge hassle. We never made it too the roof top bar, there were massive queues to get into it both nights we were there. You do get two coins at check in which you redeem at the bar inside for two free cocktails; the bar itself was lovely and the barman was really friendly, even making us cocktails that weren’t on the menu! A few other reviews commented on the noise, we must have been luck because all three nights we never heard a thing so we didn’t even need to use the ear plugs provided! Wouldn’t hesitate on returning but just be cautious that the rooms are small so not much room for movement but who stays in their room for any great length of time in the city that never sleeps!

We stayed here before flying to Europe, we had 2 big check in luggages you and it was a struggle packing, we had to pack our bags one at a time and use the bed for extra space. The room is not ideal for anyone who likes to 'settle' into their hotel room i.e use the wardrobe or lay out toilettries as there is no space. The bed in our room was wedged up against 3 walls, it was impossible for a person 5'10 or taller to sleep in this bed as they would not fit end to end .We booked a twin room, at check in the receptionist informed us a twin room could not fit 2 people as it only had a single bed. Why would you call it a twin room if it can only host 1 person? This misleading and confusing description needs to be revised. Also we were hyped up about the roof top bar which supposedly had views of the empire state buildig. Our venture up to the roof was completely a waste of time, there was no view of the empire state building. Further we were told by staff we could immediately get into the bar being hotel guests this again was wrong information.

Some of the hooks were so close to the sink that the danger of covering clothes with water or toothpaste was fairly high. Other hooks were over the TV and mirror so not particularly practical. Beds super comfy, bathroom lovely and clean and toiletries were nice. We did hear music from the rooftop bar but had taken our own silicone earplugs so it wasn’t an issue. The cheap ones provided were t great so I’d advise you take your own.Public areas were lovely and the staff were all extremely pleasant and willing to help. We didn’t eat in the hotel but the cocktails we sampled were tasty if a little expensive ($16 each).Check out was swift and they store luggage at no charge in a special area in the basement.Lifts were quick.

I am always looking on the outlook for the best possible room, in the perfect location and an amazing price. Moxy Times Square checks off all the boxes. Checkin-in was easy and the staff were very welcoming. The feel of the hotel is innovation mixed with rock & roll. It's how I imagine where the cool kids stay in NYC. The room was beautifully done, the perfect size and creatively set-up. They use every inch of the room to make it easy to use and fun to hang out in. The decor of the hotel is fun but also elegant. There is a bar that is open most of the day to serve breakfast, lunch and with the help of a DJ, amazing drinks at night. There is a room deck that is just plain fun with amazing views of the city. We had cocktails and food which were perfect and service spot on. And the location of the hotel coudn't be more ideal. South of Times Sure and not far from Hell's Kitchen which is full of great places to eat and hang out in. Overall, I loved this place. My ONLY complaint, and it' a big one, is the parking garage next door. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The staff running the place are the definition of how bad customer can really be. The price ($70 a day) is expensive even for NYC. Once they take your car, you are not allowed to see it again until you leave. I needed to get to my car twice and they made it seem like it was the end of world for them to help me. I do understand Moxy does not own or run the garage, but they do list the garage as part of their website. I will either take the train next time from Boston or park elsewhere, irregardless of the inconvienence. I love this hotel and everything it's about.

Probably not - see belowValue rating based on price paid: FairThe Details:Hotel Design Location and Layout:Location (8/10 – Met Expectation) – Located conveniently between Penn Station and Times Square you are just minutes away from tons of options, but not in the thick of the crowds.Hotel Lobby/Common Areas(8/10 – Met Expectations) – There were multiple common areas available, all fairly well appointed. Seperate check in desks made for a smooth and fast checkin. Not sure about the games down there like Giant Jenga as not really a good place to play them, I considered them more visual than practical.Hotel Amenities(8/10 – Met expectations) – The candy cart in the lobby is a nice touch. The hotel offers several dining venues and a pre-made food selection at reasonable for NYC pricingRoom:Design and Layout (5/10 – Met expectations) – Did I say the room was small? I knew the Moxy had smaller rooms going in, but this was pretty tiny. But that's manageable. More important is the tiny space means less than usual storage space and not in convenient locations. The only place to put a larger suitcase away would be the bathroom. The score would have been lower but the bathroom was comparatively spacious and well designed. Lack of any form of a desk or chair will be a negative for a business traveler. They do provide a lap desk. Only plugs in room are above the beds (the little shelves for phones there are nice, but the plugs themselves are not convenient if you need to charge a larger device like an ipad.Comfort(7.5/10 – Met expectations) – This would have been 8 except for one thing. The room I had was back on a courtyard so was mostly quiet. I say mostly because even on floor 3 I could still pick up the bass from the lounge. The one on floor 17. I was very glad the staff at check in decided to put me on a lower floor.Condition(7.5/10 – Met Expectations) – Condition as expected for a brand new hotel, except the design of the bed left a huge gap between it and window. I almost dropped something down there and when I looked I could see debris and dust buildup on the floor.Amenities(7.5/10 – Met Expectations) – Towels were nice and fluffy. Not a big fan of the combo body wash and shampoo (I know they are basically the same thing, its not that, this was just a very thick and creamy and heavy shampoo). The retro style phone with pre-recorded bedtime stories was a cute touch, but no clock. Clothes steamer in the bathroom also appreciated. Do not disturb light and blackout curtains a plus.Staff:  Front Desk/Service(8/10 – Met Expectations) – Check in was fast and efficient, and the agent immediately advised me against my higher floor preference because of the club noise.Housekeeping (7.5/10 - Met Expectations) - Only a one night stay so did not interact but room was properly prepared.Other Staff (NA)Food Service:Paid Dining:Restaurant/Cafe (NA) – Room Service(NA) - Complimentary Dining:Breakfast/Reception (NA) - Other Areas:Frequent Traveler Program: (Applicable Status) - Marriot Gold - no particular benefits at this hotel beyond standardClub/Lounge (NA) - Special Perks(bonus point) - Other:Internet Speed Test Results (from Room via Oookla): This was tough. When the net worked it was fast but had a tendency to drop out for a minute or 3 and come back up. I switched to cell data just to finish some tasks.Family Friendly: No. Rooms are too small.Pet Friendly: NoNotes: First up, I am very aware that I am NOT the target market for this hotel as a middle aged business traveler. And I know millennials look more on rooms as a place to sleep. But the design of the rooms here felt just a little claustrophobic. It was ok for one night, but I couldn't do an extended stay here, not when there are so many other options in the area. If you were looking to dance the night away and collapse into bed, this might be the place for you, but I can see even partygoers having issues hanging dress clothes and putting on makeup due to the very limited space. Of course, there may be other rooms more suited to different types of travel. The staff I interacted with were great, I love the decor and the general vibe, but overall not for me. Also note - the elevators are the kind where you request a floor from a central panel and are told which one to use. A lot of people had trouble with this even though the front desk took pains to explain to me as I am sure they had with others.Even though the average was 7.4 and I did score it a 4 overall, I almost went three because of design issues.About my system - All scores are based on expectations, where 7.5 = met expectations, 10 is highly exceeded, and 1, well, something went horribly wrong. Expectations take into account a number of factors, such as price paid, brand, and location. They will vary greatly from the Waldorf Astoria to a Super 8. All scores are averaged and translated to a score out of 10. 1 Trip Advisor dot applies for each 2 points, so 4 dots is the most likely scenario.","Marlton, New Jersey","Loonbeam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marlton, New Jersey</strong>",131,4.0

Moxy NYC ticks all those boxes in spades; you walk in to find six check-in desks, behind which are four elevators that appear immediately; the wifi connects instantly and the style of the room is retro New York meets glamping.

The first time was ok as it was only for a day (thank goodness) I must admit that regretfully I am not a huge fan of this place. If you are staying for maybe a day or so, then that is fine, but it is WAY since it is a boutique type of hotel, staying for a week is a NO GO. (I had to stay here as it was a place that my work picked as our staff hotel)First things first, checking in is fine and the girls are sweet. The first thing I dislike about the hotel is their elevator set up. Once you select which floor you are going to, the ""trendy elevator"" lets you know which bay to go to and then you wait for the said elevator. You usually have to wait until about 5 other people are also going to be in the elevator before it finally shows up to go to whatever floor you have chosen after making umpteen stops since you had to wait for others before a bay would even show up. Some would be like, why is that a big deal? When you are tired, you just want to get on the elevator and go to your room, not have to wait for like 5 other people to show up before the elevator decides that it will make the trip.Next is the room itself. I am lucky to have had a room to myself because I am not sure how those that had a double survived, seeing how small the rooms were. There are no closets or drawers in the room. Only pegs for you to hang your clothes and few cubbies under the bed to store a few items. You have to be strategic on how you hang things as well as store your desirables and luggage so that you are not tripping over everything.Having the do not disturb button on seems to not mean anything as they come in and service your room anyway (mega fail). Yes, I did report it and after that, it did not happen again. However, it should not have happened in the first place. You are either going to be freezing or burning up as the thermostat is not consistent. Also, the TV is on some weird timer and it will give you a warning that it is about to cut off. Even when you press ""ok"" for it still continues to countdown and then shut off. Annoying, especially when you are in the middle of watching a movie. I highly doubt that I will be staying here again unless it is absolutely necessary.

But everything else about my room was just not suited for people looking for comfort after a hard day of work on the road. I checked in after taking an early AM flight and working a full day, and reached my room to find it basically empty except for a bed. This is because all the furniture is collapsable and hung on hooks on the wall -- like going to an Ikea in Hell. There was not even a surface to drop my wallet, phone, etc, without first having to assemble furniture. I could only figure out the little tiny side table. There's also the world's most uncomfortable little folding chair. Useless.Bathroom: the shower was great, but the toilet was a dinky european model (that clogged twice without being actually used). The sink is in the main room, not the bathroom and may as well have a been a pitcher and a washbowl for how useful it was while shavingI understand NYC hotel rooms are small but this strategy for utilizing space did not win any points with me, personally.

At first I was hesitant in choosing this hotel because of the room size which is small compared to other property I'm considering within the price range. But I opted to try it out because of its very convenient location. I was not disappointed at all, its walking distance to some tourist spots, shopping area and train station. The staff were accommodating but don't compare it to the usual 5-star Marriott Property. The hotel has a character, it was previously an apartment for immigrants, but the way they converted the rooms made it look modern with things you don't normally see like bean bags instead of usual seats, folding furniture like a small chair and table hanged on the wall and you just open it when needed. The hotel has two bars, one on the 2nd floor and the other one on the roof deck, I tried the one in the roof deck and it was great, I passed by the one the 2nd floor it also looked ok. The one in the 2nd floor also served food during day time which I only found out on my last day where I had a light breakfast.

I read the reviews before travelling and was worried about the noise that everyone complained about so made a point of requesting a quiet room on check in so we were given a room on the 12th floor which turned out to not be quiet!! Well after a 7 hr flight and queues at JFK and then an hour slog to the hotel we entered reception with Maroon 5 booming and the staff at check in in party mode.(not what we wanted when we were tired!) I had to shout over the music to tell the member of staff my details, she swiped my credit card (didn't know what that was for) but as i checked my account the following morning i found i had been charged £42 and a sum of over £300!!! My hubby went down to sort it and the girl at check in had charged us for the room when it had already been paid for!! The money was reimbursed! Good job i checked! My advice here to the hotel would be to maybe turn the tunes down and instead of playing massive Jenga in the foyer maybe provide a better customer service at check in and then maybe stupid mistakes like this wouldn't happen???First impressions at the lift area was how pretentious the hotel felt and didn't like the whole party feel. I'm not boring by any means but i like a hotel to be a hotel and not a nightclub.We loved the room and the size didn't bother us at all. Our only complaint would be that there were no tea and coffee making facilities. The shower was amazing and the bed was so comfy.We were prepared for the noise and we did experience some but it was the Sunday night we were woken by the DJ singing and loads of clapping and shouting etc from the rooftop bar! We popped our earplugs in and they did the job! Monday night, we didn't hear any music so had a great sleep!!I preferred the feel of the hotel on a morning, we had a lovely breakfast and the staff were very welcoming at the bar area.We didn't visit the rooftop bar or the bar on the evening so i can't comment. We had free drinks tokens which we used on our last day whilst waiting for our lift to the airport. It wasn't very nice! So i bought a malibu and coke and nearly choked at the $16 it cost!!!All in all the location was great! and the room was quirky, clean and comfortable it's just not our cup of tea as a hotel and the charging of my credit card made me really angry and really shouldn't have happened if the staff had been concentrating on the job in hand instead of partying!!","Trimdon Village, United Kingdom","Claire F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trimdon Village, United Kingdom</strong>",0,3.0

The staff was all super friendly and helpful. Some reviews stated the noise was loud but I honestly did not have a problem whatsoever.

I took my 10 year old daughter to NYC for her birthday and she took a friend. I loved the double bunk beds allowing us to all have our own space to sleep. The room was slightly smaller than I anticipated, however, it was fine because we weren’t in the room much anyway. I’m not sure I would recommend this hotel for families only because the kids can’t go to the rooftop because it’s only accessible for 21 and over. My girls were a little disappointed with this but it was all good I understood. The beds were comfortable. The hotel was very clean. Great staff.

The location is excellent I can't fault that and staff were nice and helpful I just had a couple of things that I wasn't happy about. So when we booked this which was through a travel agent I had looked up on the website for pictures of room types and I did read some reviews and I understand the rooms were going to be small bit my god was my room small. The bed had a t.v which when we lied down out feet kept hitting off it. The bathroom was a good size probably bigger then the ""double"" room we booked. It was so small we didn't really have anywhere to store our luggage which was annoying because we had to live out of our case because we only had 6 places to hang stuff between two people there was hanging space at the end of the bed but thats where the t.v was so we could avail of that space.We were on the 15th floor with a view noting only corridors and windows and every night there was a DJ playing on the rooftop which was extremely loud it didn't bother me too much because of all the walking you do in NYC we were wrecked at night but one or two nights it was a struggle going to sleep as the music went onto about 4am.I did mention it to the staff that I felt like the room was a bit small and noting like the pictures on the website and it was noisey and I was told that most the rooms were like that. Then my mam and sister checked in two days later and were given a queen suite room that actually had space to walk around in this room was more like the photos I seen.It had a very cool kind of vibe and the lobby and the second floor where people were meant to hang out was very loud too not really a place to relax in. The day before check out a member of staff mentioned they could booked transfers to the airport which was great so I asked could I have late out so they gave me 1pm we were getting picked up at 2:30pm so I asked could I maybe have the room until 2pm to which I was told no because of the availability yet my sister and mother were given their room until 3pm I was told I could put my bags in the luggage room and hang out on the second floor which I thought wouldn't be great because of the rustle and bustle of that area wouldn't really be relaxing. Overall my stay was ok bit I dont think I would return to the Moxy Hotel just because the experience of it just isn't for me I'd rather somewhere to relax and have a drink after a busy day and be able to get a good night's sleep which isn't possible at the Moxy Hotel.","Dublin, Ireland","Sarah L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",2,3.0

The rooms are tiny but smartly laid out, and I get the trendy lobby/decor/attitude. Fine. But blasting EDM music from the rooftop at 2:30am on a Sunday night/Monday morning is not cool. I figured Fri/Sat nights, OK, I get it...but then Sunday was even worse! I finally called and requested a room switch from 14th floor to 3rd floor (I was wary of low number floors because the lobby was blasting music at check in). The staff was nice enough about switching me. But ultimately I ask for a nice room and a good night's sleep and the latter is nowhere to be found here. Buyer beware.

Room was newly furnished and price we paid at $185 was cheaper than other Marriott properties. Public work space on the second floor is large and comfortable. Bed reasonably comfortable. Cons:One of the smallest NY hotels I have ever stayed in. Less than 200 sq feet. The hotel/dorm room is designed to appeal to the 30 something crowd with the silly nonsense of a funky lobby and hotel room identifiers. So what you get is a single person dorm room with a bed shoved up against a wall and a one foot window to the back side of another building. My first reaction is the room on the 6th floor was a trap if a fire broke out because of the tiny window.The bathroom combo toilet/dorm shower worked but if I see another stupid cool hip design marking in a hotel room I think I will throw up. In this case it was the tile word “no diving”. Barf. Everything in the room including your table and single chair is hung up on hooks along the wall. Oh yes and there is again the stupid but absurd unrealistic bean bag in the corner which doubles as a second chair? The sink was outside the bathroom much like in a dorm and as we were shaving the sink backed up. We notified the front desk and someone did show up without a plunger and watched the water fill up and whose english was so poor that I still am unsure what his explanation meant. I think he tried to say it was the air in the pipes but who knows. Sink still fills up while brushing teeth or shaving.As a platinum Marriott member the standard benefits were not offered part of this hotel. The more boutique hotels Marriott markets the less the standard benefits are provided. The Marriott upgrade to our room was from a “double bed” to a “queen size” bed. Now if we had not been upgraded it would have been two 6’ ft people in a tiny double bed! Really? There were no rooms with two twin beds when we checked in and once we got to our dorm room we knew why....there was no room for two beds.For a single person on a tight budget in an expensive part of the city and if the price is right then this would be a good option. But give me a standard business hotel any day.,"Sarasota, Florida","SFjoe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sarasota, Florida</strong>",264,2.0

The staff was gracious and accommodating at all times, and the hotel is in a prime spot to get anywhere you're trying to go around the city, as you're right near Penn Station. There's a lot of great food options in the area as well, and honestly, I couldn't have enjoyed my stay more.

A lot louder than any of the previous nights and a much heavier bass that thumped down the walls. I rang Reception at midnight complaining and got told that it was a private party going until 3am.......... Tried the ear plugs and you could still hear it but was a bit better and finally managed to get some sleep. Spoke with some people in the lift the following morning who were also annoyed by it. We also had the fire alarm go off in the middle of the night but this stopped after a minute so we didn't need to evacuate.Didn't try the food there although went for a drink in the bar one night before heading out. When we checked in we got a token for a free ""special"" cocktail at the bar so though we'd redeem this. This was horrible and we only had a few sips each before leaving.We had to confirm our transport pickup time by phone 24 hours before our flight and the receptionist was very obliging in doing this to take us having to use our foreign mobiles.PROSA++++++ ideal location between 7th and 8th. Short walk from subway and Times Square.Room appeared to be clean.Decent electronic safe in the room which was ideal to store laptop, cash, passports etc.CONSVery noisy room top bar - avoid high floors.Noisy aircon.Quirky room - make sure you know what you are booking beforehand.","Saint-Malo, France","U9790POandrewl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint-Malo, France</strong>",6,3.0

Firstly the smell in the lobby was gorgeous and the shower gel provided smelt the same. Rooms are small and there are no drink making facilities, wardrobe or fridge. But the rooms are incredibly clean and the small space has been used well.Upsides are: modern, fun, excellent location near Times Square. Lots of breakfast places nearby can recommend the diner Andrews Coffee House. You get a free drinks token on your first night.Downsides: this hotel is for young people wanting little sleep and lots of fun. Didn’t suit us as we spent our days very busy so needed rest at night. We were 2 floors down from the rooftop bar and basically got very little sleep as it closes at 4am. They provide ear plugs but they were not very effective. Also fire alarm went off at 6am, we started to get dressed to leave then it went off. Went off again at 10pm, again got ready to leave then went off. Complained to staff but they couldn’t have cared less. Couple of female staff were nice and attentive but most of the staff are very young and need to work on their customer service skills. A modern fresh young hotel our 12 year old loved it ( free candy in the lobby) but if you want rest after a busy day sightseeing don’t stay here.","Bracknell, United Kingdom","kellieaa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bracknell, United Kingdom</strong>",16,3.0

It's modern and fun. The rooms are small, but that is what makes them really reasonably priced. The beds are laid out in a fashion that maximizes the space in the room. The bathroom/shower have opaque glass, so you have to be comfortable with the other occupants. Although you can't see clearly through them, it is a bit personal. The room was clean and they provided a steamer so you can freshen your clothes. FYI - no coffee maker. Sort of a bummer, but Starbucks is really close by so no biggie.There is a bar on the 2nd floor that is really loud, but has lots of energy. The sound of the bar floats down to the lobby (open ceiling) so if you are looking for a quiet little hotel, this isn't it. This place gets hopping as the night gets underway. We could hear it from our room (4th floor) but we weren't surprised by it. They kindly provide ear plugs for each occupant of the room in case you are having trouble sleeping. Honestly, its the city so you should expect quite a bit of noise, especially on the weekends. We didn't need the ear plugs. The beds are comfortable and the heater/air conditioner is very responsive.The location is great! It's basically equidistant from 2 metro stops on the 1 and 2 line, providing us easy access to all of uptown and downtown. The kids loved that the candy counter was open in the afternoons. They could stop off and grab a few bites of candy to take to the room or around town. They also have a foosball table in the Moxy bar which the kids enjoyed playing. You can't count on this being available, but we stayed the weekend of April 7 and they had no problem playing a few games both nights (around 7 each night).The bar menu/drinks are rather expensive, but that is probably normal for the city. The only negative I would add is: we lost one of our keys and it was in the original holder with our room number on it. Obviously I didn't want anyone to pick it up and go try the key on our door... so I asked the woman at the front desk to re-key our door. She was happy to oblige, but she didn't ask me for id. So, could I have taken my key to her and asked her to re-key another door and walk in? I didn't see her swipe my original key, and without id, I don't know how she would have known I was the true occupant. The price was really good and the only reason we would actually debate whether to stay again is that the beds were doubles and my kids were sharing a bed. One is a roller.","Centreville, VA","Elizabeth M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centreville, VA</strong>",9,4.0

You are close to subways and it is easy to walk to all the major attractions. The bar and roof top bar are very cool.However- the rooms are tiny. The hotel does try to use the walls for storage etc which is good. BUT you feel like you are cramped in a prison cell. Also we have never experienced the noise the ac generated. It produces a loud bang when in use. When we queried this we were told that’s just the motor working. We were really shocked and disappointed with this, especially the price we paid and being part of the Marriott hotel chain. Furthermore the tap (which is in the main bedroom) was constantly dripping and was very irritating. We asked to get it fixed & the engineer said he would come back and fix it- they never did.

The location is very central for main attractions in the city but the compromise is it isn't the nicest surroundings in midtown. The hotel is let down by the service and rooms unfortunately. I didn't experience the noise issues that other guests have described (I was an outside room on the 5th floor) but finding that I needed to store my clothes and toiletries on the floor was not the best start. I understand they're trying to be minimalist and the rooms are small but there is scope for shelves, cubbyholes or drawers on the walls above the hooks and the sink area badly needs a shelf for toiletries and makeup - a real miss given the targeted demographic for the hotel. I was also bitten 3 times in the room by something so being able to store clothes and toiletries more hygienically would clearly be preferable. It's great that you can stream to the TV but my TV stopped working half way through my stay. I called reception when I got in (around 11pm) who wanted to send someone up then, I said no as I was going to bed and tomorrow would be fine but no one ever arrived. When I checked in, I asked about booking transport to a trip I'd organised and was told the hotel could pre-book me a car. When I then phoned down to do this I was told they couldn't and then had to spend half an hour going back and forwards between different people explaining myself again and again.The staff also wanted to continually remove my credit card from my possession. One of the Ts&Cs of a credit card is that it remains within your sight / possession, however, on multiple occasions the bar and restaurant staff wanted to take it away for 30 minutes plus, leaving the customer open to fraud.Ultimately, if I returned to the city, as funky as the public areas are, I wouldn't choose to stay here again.","Scotland, United Kingdom","JLPScotland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scotland, United Kingdom</strong>",25,3.0

First, we were ""upgraded"" to a ""better"" room that completely disregarded my and my husband's age. I had to crawl over him to get into bed. While doing so, I realized that with the bed tucked into a corner of the room, it must be a nightmare for the custodial staff to make the bed, much less change the sheets! It probably takes them half again as long to change the sheets if the bed was positioned away from the wall. In addition, there is wasted space in our room to the left of the side table where some type of storage bin could be placed for one's clothes. While I am perfectly capable of getting on the floor to put my clothes under the bed, it wasn't fun or convenient at all. Trendy, yes, perhaps, but not user-friendly. The sink did not drain well at all. We had to swirl the water around the drain to create a vacuum to get the water to drain. This is because the floor of the sink isn't tilted enough to get the water to flow in well.I did love the toilet/shower arrangement and the water pressure was phenomenal. Our sons were in a room with two double beds, and they said their shower head was tilted, permanently, toward the wall, making it difficult to shower well.The elevator situation was awkward since there were only two places to press the elevator call buttons. When people congregated around the pad, others couldn't get to it. In addition, since the elevator numbers were always lit, you had no idea if your elevator was there unless you stood directly in front of it, and sometimes the elevators arrived and left before you could get to it. Could you also post signs somewhere educating younger people that those who are on the elevator get to LEAVE the elevator first before you get on it? At least twice, I had to force my way by people to get off. This is a safety issue, as well as just being rude.The fitness facility is large, with several ellipticals and treadmills. I wish all workout facilities were either kept VERY cold or that a fan could be turned on while I work out.However, the beds were very comfortable; our room was exceedingly quiet, it the hotel's location was perfect being just off Times Square and close to Madison Square Garden. We will be back, but would prefer a different room set up, like the one in the video when you turn on the TV.","Springfield, Illinois","Mary Beth S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Springfield, Illinois</strong>",14,4.0

As soon as you walk in the hotel has the coolest vibe. It has a couple of simple podiums where you check in with the staff. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful. We got drink tokens to get their welcome drink at Bar Moxy which is on the second floor. The drink is terrible. That’s really my only issue. One reviewer complained about the elevators. They are so simple. You touch the screen, select bedroom floors and put in which floor your room is on. It will tell you to go to elevator P1, P2, P3 or P4. It’s quite simple. There’s no getting in the elevator and then selecting your floor. It takes you right to your floor. We had a queen room. It was small but comfortable for two. We had a view of a brick wall ne t door. We didn’t spend much time in our room so that was ok. We were able to bring our fire stick and plug it into the smart tv. You can watch Netflix on it either way. The furnishings are simple yet cool and sufficient. I was surprised st how much I liked having hooks instead of a closet. It worked for us. We had a comfy bean bag chair in the corner. It was high quality and not your typical bean bag. We had a table as well. We were given ear buds by the bed but we never needed them because we heard nothing in our room. Many have complained about excessive noise. We didn’t experience that. We were on the 8th floor. Maybe that’s why. We checked out the rooftop bar. The first night the dj had a pre recorded mix that wasn’t great. The second night, a Saturday, it was so much better. It might have been pre recorded but it was great. We attempted to go to the new club Show a few blocks away but the lines were ridiculous so we left and went to Moxy’s rooftop. It was the best decision. It was great being able to do everything in your hotel. The drinks are okay no great and of course over priced. Right across the street from Moxy is a liquor store. It’s clean and has good prices and a large selection. We went there before we checked in and got a bottle. It saved us a lot of money. For lunch we went to Los Tacos in Times Square. It was amazing!! Dinner were at Katz’s Deli and Pio Pio 8. Katz’s is open 24 hours. Get the cheesesteak! Pio Pio 8 is Peruvian and the best chicken rice abs beans I’ve ever had. Not very eoehsuve. Strong drinks. I loved this hotel. We’re already planning another trip. The location is perfect and close to everything. I’ll never forget the view of the Empire State! Don’t listen to the negative. Try it for yourself. I did see some kids not many. This is great for boys or girls weekends or if you want to be out and busy and like to have fun.

Everything about the hotel was perfect. Our room on the 8th floor was very clean and spacious. The beds are so comfortable and we slept perfectly for the 4 nights. We didn’t experience any issues with noise and didn’t need the ear plugs provided.

After reading some poor reviews on Trip Advisor I was keeping my excitement levels in check but I’m glad to say the stay was really good. As another reviewer suggested, I asked for a quiet room on check in and I got one. 1639 gets more noise from street level 16 floors down than from the rooftop bar 2 floors up. Sadly my friend was not so lucky with her room but she is a better sleeper than me and was only really disturbed on one night by noise from the roof bar. Great check in crew. Always welcoming and friendly but never in your face. Very helpful whenever asked and the free storage of luggage on checkout day was a lifesaver. The free sweets on departure kept me going all through a long night flight home The room was exactly as the many pictures portray so no surprises there, but it was very clean and tidy, warm (perhaps a little too warm - never did get the hang of the heating) and attended to every day. Fabulously comfortable bed. Can’t add anything to the rave reviews regarding the shower that hasn’t been said already. Didn’t eat breakfast in the hotel but I can recommend The Bread Factory Cafe and Andrews Coffee Shop both very nearby. We did eat in Legasea. New York prices and New York portions, it was good but not exceptional. There are many better places to eat all around. This is a super quirky hotel. TA reviews sum it up pretty well and the only reason it didn’t get an Excellent from me was because there is absolutely nowhere in the hotel’s public areas (that we found anyway), to sit back and chill with a drink at the end of a long footsore day. From 17.00 onwards the music is relentlessly loud and it is impossible to hold a conversation without shouting. Great cocktails, though don’t expect much from the free tokens handed out at check in. The “champagne cocktail” came from a pump and was a very long way from France. Better to offer one token for a properly made cocktail at half price perhaps?Would I go back? Yes - promised improvements to sound insulation should sort the worst of the issues from the roof and the location is fantastic. Would I recommend it? Up to a point but do research, read reviews and take a middle line through them. If you want a peaceful country club vibe, this isn’t the place for you. But if you like a hotel that fizzes along then go for it and you won’t be disappointed.",,812christinew,5,4.0

We arrived from Scotland just after midnight to be put in a room on the 17th floor . When we arrived in the room it was very narrow & compact & also loud music from the rooftop bar . We went down stairs to be told that was the only room available but someone would be intouch with us the next day to see if it was possible to move us. This never happened so needless to say another night of sleeping with earplugs in . When I went downstairs in the morning and explained the situation again I go a very rude girl on reception who told us nothing could be done till after half 3 .After we came back in from the day we went to reception and got a really nice gent who appoligised and put us on the 12th floor . A better room and we could still the music but not as loud. I wouldnt recommend this hotel unless your a person who wants to be awake till 1 in the morning.

When I booked the room I mentioned that this was the occasion and asked if they were able to put anything in the room as a little surprise, I was not expecting anything big. They replied almost instantly saying that they would 'Hook us up' and they certainly did. Room was covered in balloons and had a huge 'Happy Birthday' sign across the top which was a nice touch. Location wise it's a 5/10-minute walk from the centre of Times Square and just around the corner from Madison Square Garden, we felt that everything we wanted to see was within a reasonable distance. If you're looking for a diner for breakfast there is 'Andrews Coffee Shop' one block down that was great, be ready to queue for a table though. Some reviews have mentioned that noise was an issue during their stay. We stayed on the 10th floor and did not have any issues with traffic noise, cant speak for rooms that may be lower down but the hotel do leave ear plugs in the room.Every staff member we came across was great and more than happy to help with anything. Before we checked out I inquired about how best to get to JFK, thinking we would either have to get an uber or yellow cab. Turns out that the hotel offer transfers to JFK, ours was a fixed rate of $75 and we were picked up in a big SUV which was nice.The room itself was clean, spacious and had a really nice shower. We were able to sign into my Netflix account through the smart TV in the room if we were feeling a bit lazy and wanted a quiet hour or two. Wifi was great (make sure when you first connect that you select the right amount of days that you will be staying there). We did not have any issues with noise from the corridors or neighboring rooms throughout our stay. Oh, and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. Cant really fault this hotel at all, they also have a free candy station open from 3 pm - 7 pm in the lobby.Would happily recommend this hotel to others.",,Ross N,1,5.0

The staff were unapologetic - ‘this happens all the time’, ‘a booking only guarantees a room, not a room type’. Well what’s the point of booking a room type then?! They told us they would try to change us to the room we booked the following day and to leave our stuff in the room in the morning and they’d move us during the day. We got up after an uncomfortable sleep in a tiny bed, repacked our stuff and went downstairs to the Lobby. We let the staff here know the situation only to be told we couldn’t leave luggage in the room and they weren’t allowed to help us move it. So essentially we need to remove the bags ourselves, check out, and can check back in sometime after 3pm. The service and attitude provided by the staff has been so poor, it’s really made an awful start to our New York holiday which we’ve been planning since last year. Worst, we are stuck here for another six nights - let’s just hope we actually get a room later and things improve.

The location is perfect!Upon entering the hotel, I felt the urban, modern vibe right away - loved it. My room was very clean, right down to the corners of my bathroom (which is very important to me).The room was fairly small, but I still enjoyed it and I was really glad to find that my room actually looked like the picture advertised by the hotel. If the view from your room matters to you, I would advise requesting a view of the busy streets of NY prior to booking. The view from my windows were of tall buildings - no action (however, I did not mind this...just something to be mindful of). The service at Moxy was excellent. The staff were friendly and genuine - I really appreciated their manner, especially on the phone. They were very professional and polite! The bed was very comfy and any requests I made were accommodated quickly.I recommend packing an extra light (like a small bendable lamp or a book light, if you plan on doing any reading, or doing your makeup to go out during the evening). Also pack hangers if you are staying for an extended period of time and would like to keep your clothes out of your suitcase...there is not much storage space. As for any hotel, I would also advise packing an extension cord.I rate the Moxy NYC 5 stars. I especially liked that guests have the option to keep their bags at the hotel (free of charge) after checking out. This was an added bonus for me because it allowed me to explore the city sans heavy luggage before catching my evening flight.I will definitely stay at the Moxy again next time I am in New York. I hope to checkout their rooftop bar the next time I am there.Overall, great experience! :)","Whitby, Canada","chantellebish0p2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitby, Canada</strong>",0,5.0

Would rate this as one of my favorite hotels in NYC (having stayed at more than 15 different ones) - it does not have the largest room, may not be as elegant as the W, but has character, and is interesting, beginning with the sculpture in the lobby, to the non-traditional check in counters, to the utilitarian rooms with tiles, metal and knobs to hang clothes. The location is great, yes but there are more than 2 dozens hotels in the vicinity. One can draw inspiration from the decor and the furniture, and the sitting/working area on the 2nd floor is fantastic. I like Egghead, the inhouse breakfast joint, and had lunch at Legasea (so-so). The gym is in the basement, and pretty sad. I feel a little claustrophobic in the dark wood-paneled elevator, and the hip music makes it a little better. The bed is comfortable and the heating flows upwards to the ceiling, rather than blasting into my face, which is a plus. It is a little noisy, even though I was on the highest floor, the soundproofing between rooms is not fantastic. They provide earplugs. Like the body wash/shampoo and the shower is very easy to use (I would not say that for 3/4 of the hotels I stay in). And it is one of the few hotels in the US where there are enough lights in the room for it to be nicely illuminated.

I really don't need to be overstimulated upon entering the hotel with loud club music, rowdy workers cheering one another on in oversized versions of Jenga and Connect4 and basketball.

How do you wow travelers and lure them into your new hotel in the center of the hustle and bustle of The City? the answer is: The Moxy Hotel. This hotel has the cool vibe of any higher priced hotel (owned by The Marriott after all) but at a cool lower price. From the moment you arrive, you are in for a treat--don't miss the candy bar where you can scoop out from an assortment of candies to take with you. The best part...it's complimentary. We also received two tokes for the bar to experience our ""welcome drink"" also complimentary...Be sure to ask upon check in how to use the elevator, they are very cool and modern but can be tricky for non techies. The rooms are also really cool, ours had two large single beds set up like a train car and I overheard a conversation about other rooms having bunk beds.

There are SO many places to stay in NYC, there is no need to choose this one. It wants so hard to be hip, but fails at the expense of comfort, sanity and normal hotel behavior. The whole place feels like you're crashing at your college friend's dorm room.Pros: Location. It is in a great location. The staff is very pleasant, if someone lost about what is going on. It's as if it's everyone's first hotel job. They WANT to be great, but they don't know how to do it. The elevators that send you (mostly) to your own floor are very cool.Cons: So many. Housekeeping. I don't know what they did other than make the bed, because in three days there I never had towels or glasses replaced. The first two days I sought out Housekeeping and they got me towels immediately. The third day, I called the front desk and they told me that I just needed to go to the room that said ""Stash"" and get my own. Seriously? Why wouldn't they let me know this from day 1? The earbuds (so many sets in the room!) were an indicator of the noise level. Fortunately, in our room, it wasn't as bad as I heard other guests complain about. The room is tiny - I mean I could stretch my arms from one side to the other tiny. At the end of the room was the queen bed - no room on three sides. Do NOT sit up at night because you bonk your head on the bunk that's on top. The TV is huge - seriously huge - which would be nice if you weren't 3 feet (max) away from it. Worst is the lighting. That may sound funny, but you can't put on makeup or shave! The tiny light is directly over your head. It's not possible to see clearly enough to put on makeup. I cannot imagine who would come up with that design. The water in the shower is tepid at best. You don't need to turn the cold water nozzle on because the hottest it gets is tepid. Finally, I had some papers FedExed to me, but the hotel refused delivery because they ""get so many packages that they can't store them all."" What? Just accept packages for people who are at the hotel and put the packages in their rooms, if necessary. Instead, this new (month old) policy mean that my package was delivered ""2 doors down."" There was no store 2 doors down, and I never found the store where my package was supposed to be. I was off during the day did not have time during the store's open hours to look and find it. Of course, if I found it, I'd have to pay at minimum $5 to pick it up! This is relatively unbelievable for a Marriott hotel.

We had a room on the 5th floor, which was a double double room. The room was small and compact, but you expect nothing else in New York. The room was practical and the beds were comfortable. They have a safe in the room under one of the beds. They had several pegs around the room allowing for you to hang up your clothes. The bathroom was clean and the shower was great.

Inside the stash cupboard you have irons and ironing boards, additional towels, extra toiletries, toothbrushes, eye masks etc, which is a great idea.

This is a hotel very much designed with a minimalist European aesthetic and sensibility. The good news is it is a good, clean, affordable hotel in a good location in Manhattan. But, for those looking for all the standard American hotel chain amenities then you'll be disappointed.I like the room because it maximizes a small space. Unlike other higher cost hotels I've stayed at in NYC that have tiny rooms packed with too much furniture, this room feels spacious because it gets rid of everything you likely don't really need or rarely use. The hooks are great, though the lack of a traditional closet does limit how much you can really hang and if two people were in my room it would have been an issue. The bed is definitely not easy for two people as the person closest to the window had to crawl over the other to get in or out. Again, not an issue as I was alone but two people likely wouldn't have enjoyed it.I also really like the ""stash"" closet on each floor which allows guests to get extras without waiting for housekeeping. The self-service is more convenient and easier.It's definitely a hotel that does not encourage lounging in the room but rather tries to facilitate everyone getting out of the room to congregate in the common spaces. Definitely something designed for Millennial guests so older guests may not appreciate the lack of comfort in room.Breakfast at the bar was consistently good. Legasea was also very good, though I didn't appreciate the hostess essentially telling me they wouldn't sit a single person at a table even when the restaurant wasn't full and I had checked on Open Table that there were reservations available.

Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted and brought to a check-in station (not your traditional front desk). I was quickly checked in and given two free drink coins that could be used at the second floor bar. I was also offered complimentary boxed water and grabbed a couple to take to my room. There’s also a free candy cart in the lobby—just help yourself! The elevators can be a little confusing to use at first, but you get the hang of it. My room was small—as I anticipated. Just big enough for the bed and bathroom. The bed was comfy. I requested a couple of extra pillows which made a huge difference. Love the shower—best water pressure in NYC! The room was neat and clean...which I appreciate. I was in room 1405 and did not have any issues with noise—quiet nights sleep!I deducted one point for the following that I felt were missing from this hotel experience:-There is no coffee maker/Keurig in the hotel room. Love a cup of coffee when I wake up-No iron and ironing board in the room (they do have a handheld steamer in the room was it didn’t quite work well)-There’s not a closet, just hooks to hang clothes onI would recommend Moxy as a comfortable hotel with small rooms—if you just need a place to sleep and shower this is perfect.For a business traveler looking for more—may not be for you.","Minneapolis, MN","TravelingGuys2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, MN</strong>",10,4.0

The room does not come with complimentary water. Just reusable plastic cups. For something that is supposed to used consistently, plastic is not the way to go. I still filled up the cup because I was thirsty and I got a cup with gray water (see pic). Went look my for ice and soda machine and did not find any on the floor above and below me. I then called the front desk and they told me that they do not have ice or vending machines and that I would have to go to the bar on the 2nd floor (staying on the 15th) to get either. Being in some sleep ware, I now had to dress up and go into a packed bar so I can have a glass of water. CRAZY! After that fiasco, I crawled into bed and realized they only place 2 flat pillows (I am a side sleeper and need at least 2 for myself) on the bed and they do not use a sheet. Just a duvet with blanket inside. For a Marriott hotel, I feel that this is just unacceptable. The TV placement in my room was also horrible (see pic). It took up valuable space under the hooks and it does not allow you walk at the base of the bed, which screws the 2nd person in the bed against the windows. They literally have to jump over the 1st person to get out of the bed. Also, when I was laying in bed, my feet are a little over a foot away from the tv and in the view.

We were headed to see Sponge Bob the Musical and wanted a reasonably priced hotel convenient to the theater district, but didn't want to be in the center of things as we were in December at the Doubletree Hilton Times Square. We loved this location and as a bonus there is a parking garage literally next door (where we made an advanced reservation for our minivan 'an oversized car in Nyc' using the app ParkWhiz). Check in was perhaps the friendliest I've ever experienced anywhere and as a nice gesture guests are given drink tokens that can be cashed in for signature prosecco drink for adults and Shirley temple for kids. We had a room with 2 double beds that were situated end to end in the shoebox shaped room. The decor is modern and trendy with a fun: We got a kick out of the ""Leave me Alone"" button to push that lights up outside your room instead of hanging a boring ""Privacy Please"" tag on the door knob, the bath room has a swimming pool theme that was fun--plenty of counter space and a terrific rainmaker shower head. There's no wardrobe or closet, but rather about 60 peg/hooks where you stash your coats and clothing which for a short stay was not a problem and kind of fun. We were on the 10th floor overlooking the interior courtyard. Our room was not noisy--no loud base music that I have seen referenced in other reviews--we did not use the earplugs that were supplied. Only minor negatives were that the air handler in the room was noisy and the bathroom door doesn't seal shut so you can hear noises from bathroom in the bedroom--the door closes tightly, but there's a gap at bottom and hinge side so noise travels. The second floor of the hotel is a real gem for families or groups staying in separate rooms. There's a large bar that is family friendly, several large square game tables in side rooms and board games to play, comfy couches in a variety of arrangements for groups large or small, a foosball table (free) and a light fare snack menu and grab and go food area as well.

The Hotel has only been open since September of last year. I was lucky to come across something about it on Instagram. The great thing about the hotel was it offered bunk beds since there is at least 8 of us going this was an amazing option (Also a great price). The hotel is very trendy which we all loved & you can even play jenga in the hotel lobby. The rooms were very comfortable and fit everyone's stuff. The hotel staff was so friendly! The 2 bars at the hotel definitely had different vibes at each. The rooftop bar called The Magic Hour was very cool but, at 2 they close off the carousel bar. The other side of the roof is very nice but, not exactly what we were looking for. We tried the bar on P2 (Not sure what the name was). We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartenders they were super friendly & one even did to magic tricks for us!

It was exactly as expected since I researched online beforehand. Price was very reasonable and good value. Very small rooms - but it is NYC after all. I'd rather have a smaller cool looking space than the usual two queen, dull textiles & ho-hum furniture - particularly for a quick trip to this city. My daughters liked being in a trendy and more hip space. Location is really the garment district but Times Sq. is totally within walking distance - as is Bryant Park. No closet - but everyone has warned you about this.They could def use a few more hooks in the bathroom IMO. I don't think we received maid service but for a short stay was no big deal. Fun atrium lobby, meeting spaces, bar on 2nd floor. I never hit the rooftop bar. Our room 422 was quiet. It was a single loft over a queen - facing inside alley space. Fitness room on basement level was fine and empty although at one point - it took elevator a while to get down there and made me think for a minute I might be stuck. Candy bar was a nice touch. I think the check in area needs some improvement - there seemed to be no rhyme or reason - who was checking in - checking out etc. Maybe a velvet rope might create a queue? I was waiting for help while other guests would walk to another desk and be served. Also a bench in the 1st floor lobby would be welcome - was pouring and cold outside and would've been nice to sit near window while waiting for uber etc.","Boston, Massachusetts","Angelina617</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",30,4.0

The space is tight but reasonably well arranged IF you don't need to spend time in the room other than sleeping or dressing. The queen rooms have more room than the double queen rooms, and have furniture such as chairs and lap desks hanging on pegs on the wall, which is also where you put your clothes. The double queen room has two beds end to end and a companionway about three feet wide running the length. One issue was that the toilet in the bathroom was directly in front of the head of one of the beds and the sliding glass door and lack of exhaust fan didn't offer any privacy. That being said, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was sufficient and the shower was hot with good pressure. There are 2 restaurants in the hotel and the second floor bar serves breakfast and has a 2-go bar for food to take with. We didn't eat in the restaurants but did have a nice breakfast in the bar. The rooftop bar got a lot of hype but wasn't really all that special as far as I could see but half of it was closed in the winter and apparently that's where the carousel is, which could be quite fun. When we went up to the rooftop to just take a look, all the tables already had ""Reserved"" signs on them so I don't know that that was all about - I asked but didn't really get an answer.The location of the hotel is good and the prices when we were there were quire reasonable.","Saint Helena Island, South Carolina","happyfeet51</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Helena Island, South Carolina</strong>",48,4.0

We arrived late having been travelling all day and our first impressions were not good...loud, like really loud music in the dark sparse reception area, coupled with a unique aroma which you can smell from the approaching street akin to a cheap perfume or fabric conditioner did not fill us with optimism. It reminded me of walking into a hollister or Abercrombie and fitch ..low lighting, young hip trendy staff and aftershave overload. The young gentleman who checked us in (pink hair) was very helpful and our room , whilst very small and minimalist , was immaculately clean and comfortable. There is no wardrobe or drawers for clothes, but the quirky hooks provided an area for hanging shirts and jackets. Not a lot of space for storing suitcases , but we were in the room basically to change , shower and sleep so it fulfilled its purpose for us. We did not encounter any of the internal noise problems described on other reviews, but did hear a few complaints from guests who were on lower floors 3-5 and higher floors 14-16. Our room was made up daily and we received daily clean towels and the room had the most fabulous shower ever. The bar area on the 2nd floor and the roof top bar were both great. We found the staff throughout the hotel friendly , helpful and polite and overall we enjoyed our stay. Probably wouldn't go back as we've been home in Scotland for 2 weeks now and I still can't get the cheap perfume smell out my nostrils!

The rooms were ergonomically designed and offered great storage options, considering there was no closet. Instead the bed had shelves underneath to store your luggage and shoes, and there were hooks on the walls to hand your clothes. The bar inside, and the rooftop bar, were equally impressive.

This is a clue to a MAJOR problem that hopefully is being resolved now.Imagine rehabbing a historic hotel and bringing up to modern standards but then leasing roof top to a disco without any regard to the impact of its noise on their 600+ room hotel. The present reality is that the disco operates to after 1 AM without any noise constraints and severely impacts most (all?) of the hotel rooms. The hotel appears to be in the process of replacing all the room windows with more soundproof versions, starting at the top floors. Will it work? Who knows? But unless you can confirm the upgrade was successful I suggest you avoid this place unless you have certain sleep disorders that let you sleep through any noise or which prevent you from sleeping until 2 AM any. Or unless you are a millennial who intends to party until 2AM EVERY night Just scan some of the bad reviews, an unusually large percentage, and you can see this is a bad problem. Otherwise it is a very promising hotel at a good price point. The rooms are small but well designed. It is a convenient location for visitors. Make sure you understand the room size, but the website is clear. We reserved an upgraded corner king size room, not the minimal size room and found the price reasonable.There was some mixup. The day before we came we discovered we needed a medication requiring refrigeration. We called the hotel and discovered that if a refrigerator was needed for medication, it would be provided for free. (Room has neither refrigerator nor coffee pot - unless most rooms these days.) But while we we assured at checkin that the fridge would arrive ""in 5 minutes"", it required 30 minutes and 2 more calls to actually get it!! Also considering how small the room was and the fact we only needed about 2 cubic inches, it was a rather large unit - a few cubic feet.In summary, a promising hotel. Most of the problems noted in earlier reviews seem under control, but unless the disco noise problem is solved quickly the big bucks spent on the rehab will go down the drain. A quick look at preview reviews shows that Marriott is now rapidly alienating many of its most loyal customers with this situation.

A few off things: The bartender was perturbed when we brought the drink tokens, and literally poured a splash of prosecco for us. We tipped her well, and are sure this had to be as a result of ALL the tipless drink tokens she received daily. On our first night, the pipes next door burst, causing the elevators to be down (luckily we only had to walk up 8 flights of stairs), but also caused the fire alarm to go off at least five times after 11pm.

The room is very small and laid out more like a dorm or hostel. There is no closet, but a row of hooks with a hanging folding table, chair and 3 hangers. And although the shower was large, the toilet was located in the same shower area with no separation. Finally, there is no desk - this is definitely not a business hotel. And just in case you were wondering, its certainly not a romantic getaway either. Its simply functional and funky.All in all, I enjoyed the innovative spirit of this hotel and I'm glad I tried it. But the noise levels, small rooms and lack of business amenities discourage me from considering a stay here again with so many other options in New York.","Saint James, New York","Joe6strings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint James, New York</strong>",253,3.0

Lobby, halls and rooms were different from pretty much any hotel I've stayed at. Hip vibe throughout which worked for me but might not appeal to others. The rooms are real small yet well laid out and as others have mentioned plenty of hooks yet no closet. Everything is brand new. The cost of the stay was rather reasonable for NYC yet something has to give in return. Maybe the noisiest room, from the private carting trucks (garbage trucks) outside that I've ever had in my life. Faced 36th street. They kept coming from 11pm-12:30pm one after another to the different businesses adjacent to the hotel. I did ask for a quiet room when I checked in. Guess there is a reason they have earplugs in the room. They need to do something to soundproof the rooms from the outside and I live in an urban area. The 2nd floor bar and the lounge on the top were rather nice and the food above average with the drink tokens being a great touch.

We were greeted with a cocktail token and shown where everything was, mainly the bars which was excellent, we had a double room that faced out over 7th Avenue, with good blinds so people in the building opposite couldnt see in! We had a alre shower and a quirky bathroom area, the only drawback was the lack of closet space but they had a lot of hooks along the wall which we used. The rooms were cleaned every day, the hotel is in a smashing location and the staff couldnt do enough to help (including extra cocktail tokens when I was cold). the bar on the mezzanine was great and had a cool vibe and the rooftop bar was amazingly weird, we sat on a merry go round for about 4 drinks, and whilst the terrace area was closed due to it being winter I was still allowed to have a nose around. I would recommend this hotel, although perhaps not suited for people who like to be neat and tidy as chances are you will only have the hooks in your room and not a wardrobe. Great stay.

Yes, the rooms are not huge and no, this hotel isn't a haven of peace and quiet, but it's New York - get over it!The room itself has all you need, whether it be for a couple of nights on business or a getaway to the big city. Space isn't the hotels selling point, but you soon get over it when appreciate how clean the hotel is and how great the location is. The shower was particularly pleasant, which incorporated the generally appeasing interior or the rooms and hotel alike. Fresh towels were provided daily, bedrooms redressed too. It would suffice to say that our expectations were exceeded for what was a 3-night Christmas getaway. Other highlights of the hotel included the bar area, of which you receive tokens for a free cocktail at the beginning of your stay. Again, keeping up with the trendy vibe of the establishment, the bar served as the perfect area for a drink or two before heading out to dinner. This must not be confused with the roof-top bar that is available to guests, but at a premium. We were quoted $100 entry per person, which we concluded was a hefty price, but saw the appeal had we decided to immerse ourselves in the local night life.In conclusion, we had a pleasant stay here. The Moxy Times Square is a cosmopolitan flare in very busy area of Midtown New York. It's simplistic, it's trendy, it's very a la mode. If you want serenity, a turndown service and a mint on your pillow then go and stay in Central Park - or maybe just don't stay in New York at all. It doesn't take a genius to figure out whether this hotel is going to be for you or not before you stay here - it's why reviews exist.

In the many situations where it went off during my stay (4 AM, 10 PM, 11 PM, 12 N) they were all false alarms. It would probably been advisable that they explain this prior to check-in so that you know not to start fleeing the building when you first hear it If you are thinking of working from the hotel not all rooms have a desk. Mine had a lap desk that you could use in the bed. My stay was unexpectedly extended due to the Blizzard of 2018 and the hotel was kind enough to offer a reduced rate of $99 for that one night.

HOWEVER, this was every night. I am a light sleeper and I have not had one full night sleep yet- whether from the lack of glazing on the windows (also makes it freezing) that amplifies the noise from outside of whether it’s the fire alarm that went of 5 times during our stay. The last 2 times the alarm went off no one reassured us that there was no issue. No one was clear on the instruction over the fire alarm- stupidly dangerous considering we are 14 floors up. Thank goodness we have no children is all I could think.We are a young couple (what the hotel is aimed at) and the quality is not up to standards. Although the shower is powerful, it’s luke warm. Sink water is hot- so they’ve obviously turned it down to save costs.

Staff do not where uniform so it's a guessing game of who works their and who doesn't.- no wardrobe, no mini bar, no room service (not even for water), very small rooms (quite cosy and reasonable clean) - rubbish view of the building opposite for majority of rooms (always a cold breeze by the windows)- I'd recommend sleeping in your coat as the heater in the room is unbelievably loud, and wakes you up every 2 hours (unless the fire alarm does which occurred 3 out of our 6 nights here) let's just say I'm glad it was a false alarm as relying on the staff here in an emergency situation is scary as they had absolutely no idea how to handle it.. or stop it ! - beds are quite comfy, only one pillow, however when I rang to ask for our sheets to be changed the unhelpful lady informed me that the hotels policy is to change bed sheets and towels every SEVEN DAYS ONLY. Never stayed in a hotel with this policy, and alternatively you can go to the store cupboard and sort it out yourself ...- we booked this hotel as the New Years package on the roof top looked good, however when trying to purchase tickets no staff members could help. When any issue arises staff members fob you of from one person to the next person to the manager to the third party.. so on and so forth.. we were told we had to pay $250 each, plus VAT, plus $60 ticket fee, when we later found out other individuals paid $110 each. Hotel members should have supposedly got 10% off these tickets, however this didn't happen. Matt and Zach, probably the only two helpful staff members in the entire building eventually, after 3 stressful days got us tickets at $195pp. We also never received and confirmation from the hotel regarding check in or check out or any hotel information at all.Ultimately - I understand this hotel has recently opened, and they may still be finding their feet.. if you just want to solely sleep here, it is more than adequate, but for any assistance what so ever, research other hotels.

Instead of her helping me she said I needed to go down to the front desk and they will give me one. I left breakfast and went to the front desk. They told me I would have to go down the block and try and find one as they don't have papers and I should just use the apps! December 30th I stopped in the lounge to reserve a table and seats for the 4 of us for a New Years Eve event. I was told by the bartender to find the manager and he would help me schedule it. She didn't call the manager or help me find him just told I would have to find him. There was nobody at the bar... I found the manager and he told me that the bartender was wrong and I needed to contact a third party across the street to reserve a table for the event. Instead of him calling his contact he had me go get a pen and paper and he got me the name and number. I called the 3rd party across the street and they told me they don't handle reservations for that event and I had to discuss with the lounge and manager! Dec 31st we went down and asked to get car service to LaGuardia Jan 1st at 9:30am. The gentlemen that handles that brought out his binder with fee schedules and on the front of the binder in bold it stated LaGuardia was $55 from the Moxy. A large van cab was $35-$40 so no big deal. We agreed on $55 and booked it. The car service showed up on time and we loaded up. The driver said he would be right back and went inside the Hotel. He came back out and said the price was now $65. I stormed in and got the guy and his binder. We opened it up and saw our reservation. He had taken a pen and changed $55 to $65 poorly. My wife was right behind me and she handled this one as professionally as she would have at this point. Someone was just getting an extra kick back of $10, no big deal, but it was for some reason to us.i would never write anything like this but I am writing a letter to Marriott corporate and Bill Marriott himself. I don't know if he will ever get it but I am compelled. I stood in the little lobby full of new people checking in and told the manager this was not a Marriott and in no way do they reflect the values and culture or what Marriott is. I would strongly advise picking any other Hotel to stay at.Scott FairmanBettendorf, Iowa","Bettendorf, Iowa","Scott F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bettendorf, Iowa</strong>",9,1.0

In an effort to make certain I understood the ethos or vibe they were going after, I booked 3 nights with my kids. This in my mind would represent a “worse case scenario” trial. Here is my take away from the 3 nights. First a quote from Bill Bullard so people understand that trip advisor, when in the wrong hands can ruin a business. ...”Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge… is empathy.”Yes this is my lowly opinion.I now know for certain, that despite whatever psychological studies have been done about lobbies, second floor lobbies, making the transaction part of the stay less memorable and the lobby more memorable by separating them on two floors is just a pile of bla bla bla. When you enter a hotel that is chasing that hipster dollar and trying so hard to be different, you still need a door man. Someone to open the door. Period. No name tags, I get the pragmatic approach but at least introduce yourself at check in to customers. First impression... I now get the weight of that concept. Walk in, there is no bell man, door man or lobby for that matter. The cool and warm lobby is on the second floor...which you will miss if you are a normal human being that wants to shower after getting off a flight. From the ground floor straight up to the room is generally what I witnessed. The tokens they give you at check in I suppose are meant to lure you back down. I stayed all over Europe and struggle to understand why a youth hostel is cool now. In a hostel, the bathroom is in the hall to save space. I would not have ruled that option out completely here. Yes, it was unbelievable how noisy, yes the windows seemed to somehow amplify the noise into your room. It is true, room comes with earplugs; even as a 20 something university party goer...I still slept. So don’t tell me I’m too old to stay here, if I was 25 and out till 2 I’d still need to sleep at some point. This place seems to pride itself on its party theme and the hotel that never sleeps. Success if that’s what they were after. The HVAC in the room is totally and completely absurd. It is ether a total ice box in the room or a hot mess. There is a brief ten minutes in between where you will find comfort as it “automatically” cools and heats to find the temperature you’ve set it for. The room:The entire hotel seems to have ripped a page out of ikea. There is a point where pragmatic, or utilitarian becomes sterile or useless. The bathroom sink is in the room to cleverly save space...so you can watch your wife brush her teeth. The shower and toilet are combined, so she can watch you void the days edibles. There is room for a partition between the shower and the toilet which would have been terrific. Here’s why...The shower head, which is an incredible rain type fixture that distributes an amount of water that would make Noah nervous. HOWEVER, the temperature maxes out where infants are safe. Technically warm, but arguably so. Therefore, had there been a partition rather than a 50 square foot shower-toilet...you wouldn’t shiver while using the body wash on your hair. (Yes, no shampoo, just body wash-shampoo in one) Things like that, and no hangers for certain sweaters and shirts I now know will only make people angry on a different level. The room is totally hard surfaced and in the absence of a top sheet on the bed, just makes for a cold experience outside the temperature connotation. Alex the manager gave a nice tour, seems to be someone my team would love to work for. Very approachable and affable guy. In the world of social media and data crunching and VIPs and all that cool manipulation of the herd I can only make one suggestion for you. As a manager, look through the eyes of a customer. Read all the terrible complaints about the noise and see that your cut and paste form letter response is read by the average customer. Hotel goers don’t read the sterling reviews, they read the terrible ones to see what to look out for. What customers are seeing is that you are running out of things to say and you’re busy. I can assure you people, I got a good read on this manager, he cares...but when there are this many complaints and the construction is done, he doesn’t get paid enough to take this many bullets for his crew. Marriott should give Alex a raise or move him on up, he has paid his dues.",,Sterling N,7,2.0

Looked amazing for a young couple but sadly I was mistaken. Start on a good note, the staff were really friendly & upgraded us when we arrived which was really nice. The room was spacious, we were upgraded to the Queen room. Great location aswell, 4th time in New York so know my way around but this was in the perfect location for newbies! However there was no storage space, no cupboard or shelves only coat hooks and a small hole under the bed. So sadly had to live out our suitcases the whole week, which was messy and took up the floor space. The windows were far to thin, the draft coming through was so cold & the noise from the street was like you were standing on the sidewalk. Not to mention we were woken up with the music coming from the rooftop bar early in the AM, we were on the 7th floor so would have hated to have been further up. The fire alarm went off at around 10.30pm & I feel the staff should be trained on how to properly action the announcement advising they were investigating the alarm, it was like they didn't know how to work it and it was more frustrating than the actual alarm. It then went off again 2 nights later at 4.30am & the same again, most frustrating situation. End on the only other good points, the bed is very comfortable. Sadly wouldn't stay again, I am 24 and really thought this hotel would have been amazing but unfortunately not & even though New York is the best city in my eyes, I couldn't wait to come home to get a good night's sleep!

I chose the Moxy because of the location (ideally situated between MSG and Times Square), as well as the fact that the hotel offered the unique option of a room with four bunked twin beds (which allowed our kids to not have to share a bed, a big treat for them for a hotel room). We arrived to a nice but fairly minimalist lobby where friendly staff greeted us, and checked us in at small podiums. The whole hotel is brand new, modern, and clean, and has a nightclub feel to it. We arrived about an hour before the standard check-in time, so we were encouraged to head up to the 2nd floor bar/lounge area to relax while our room was being prepared. There was comfortable seating and some games to pass the time. The first odd hospitality experience came when my wife and I decided to order a drink while we waited... my wife ordered a Moscow mule, and I ordered the IPA on tap, and we were told that they were out of both ginger beer as well as the IPA, so they couldn't serve either drink we ordered, which was odd for a bar to be 0 for 2. We also noticed that the large cushion on the back of one of our chairs had sex scenes pictured all over it, which I didn't personally care about, but wasn't appropriate for my kids to be staring at.When we went to our room, along the hallway, we saw several nearly nude mannequins posed in a holiday scene in the center of the building. (Again, not a huge deal, but a little odd to walk the kids by.) When we arrived in the room, it was nice, had some really unique design, and was on the small side but not unheard of for NYC. The bathroom/shower had a glass wall separating it from the main sleeping area, which didn't seem terribly private. The biggest issue was that the room was frigid, blowing cold air from the A/C, and the thermostat was not allowing us to heat the room. We made multiple calls to have it fixed, and were told each time that help was on the way, but after not getting any help, they finally moved us to a similar room on another floor. I later had to request extra pillows to elevate my leg due to a knee injury I was traveling with, and we again had a lengthy wait and multiple calls before someone arrived.I did not experience the noise issues others mentioned, but I did see that earplugs were provided in the room, so it may depend on room location.Overall, the good:+ Great location+ New and clean+ Good value, relatively reasonable cost per night for the area+ Unique design+ Friendly staffNegatives:- Spotty service (will hopefully improve as hotel is more established?)- Theme is more adult-oriented, and while fine in general, obvious that they are not catering to the family/young kids crowd",,Ozzy1218,4,4.0

Woman who checked us in clearly had better things to do - no explanation of elevator use, facilities, wifi or anything important we needed to know, really. Arrived to the room which had dirty sheets. It’s okay, my partner and I said to each other - we’ll let this one slide, and then the next day housekeeping will come in and fix it. Housekeeping still is yet to appear.We are actually staying here right now - our third night of seven while in NYC. It’s important people see reviews while guests are actually staying there - not after stay after thoughts. We have approached reception staff twice to complain about dirty sheets, no housekeeping for three days as well as towels that need to be changed (among other things).The first woman couldn’t be less helpful - no apology, didn’t even break a sweat at her desk. The second man was very apologetic and said he would look into it. After the second man looked into it, around 20 minutes later a member of staff came with one fresh sheet, an extra blanket and towels. “Can you please change the sheets?” we asked - “No, I’m only doing the delivery. We only have one housekeeping person for the whole hotel. She’s very busy”. Busy doing very little it seems.What we then came to realise was that housekeeping actually HAD come to our room. We knew this as we checked out the trash can in the bathroom, which had been emptied (and definitely not by us). Please check the photos we have attached to show you her bed making skills.The ‘hot’ water in the room is not ideal, especially when it’s -10C outside. The air conditioner could wake up a hibernating bear, and we really didn’t appreciate the fire alarm going off at 3:30am on our second night there, to then be bombarded with ridiculous voice overs from hotel staff who clearly (a) had no idea what was going on, and (b) have no idea how to manage situations like this. Fire alarms happen, but the way it was handled was a joke.This is not a cheap hotel (unbelievably part of the Marriott chain) - and my partner and I have both lived overseas for a long time, as well as travelled to numerous countries. There’s a difference between error and incompetence. Clearly MOXY abide by the latter.Do not stay at this hotel - NYC is a big place and I’m confident another place will appreciate your investment into their business much, much more.",Male,"trip20111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Male</strong>",9,1.0

We chose this hotel because 1)it’s a Marriott and 2) my kids saw the bunk beds and begged to stay here. We were there for a week. The location was great. Just a few blocks from Times Square, Bryant Park, and even Rockefeller Center. The subway station was just down the street. When I was researching, I saw alot of reviews on how small the rooms were and the noise level. So, I was trying to prepare myself. First, I am a super light sleeper, so anytime we travel and stay in a hotel, I always sleep with earplugs, so this part wasn’t anything new to me. However, I was worried about my kids being able to sleep, so a few weeks before our trip, I called the hotel and told the lady (she was super nice and accomodating, by the way) my concerns and she said don’t worry, I have already booked you a corner room in the middle of the hotel and have already issued you a room number. And, sure enough, she did! I was able to sleep fine every night without any noise issues. My kids were also able to view the street below from our room, which they enjoyed, especially on the day it snowed. The staff was also very friendly and accomodating. One of my kids pushed the do not disturb button by mistake, so one day we didn’t have clean towels. I went downstairs to ask for some and they had dropped them off before I made it back to the room. My kids enjoyed the little candy cart they set up in the lobby for a little while each night. The room was quite small, the other reviews are pretty accurate on that. We had 2 big suitcases and 3 carry ons (because winter and a weeklong stay). It was pretty tight with all that. I tried to hang as much as possible on the hooks. Our suitcases took up all the space in the little entry nook. I stored our shoes in the little cubbies under the beds. But, there just wasn’t much moving around room. We were basically only in our rooms at bedtime, so we managed. One thing that I did not like is that the bathroom isn’t very private. The doors are sliding frosted glass doors. I could see anyone who was sitting on the toilet (not like regular glass, but pretty well). I wish the bathroom would have had solid walls for privacy. However, I did LOVE the shower head! I wanted to stay in there forever! One other thing that was disappointing was that there was no refrigerator, so we couldn’t bring back leftovers. I knew this beforehand, so it was just something we dealt with. Overall, this was a fun and pleasant hotel. We had a great experience here and would stay again (maybe not for a week, or maybe during warmer months where we don’t have so many clothes to pack). My kids loved it!

If you are looking for a hotel that is in a central location close to everything then this hotel is perfect! It is on the doorstep of Times Square, Empire State and Madison Square Garden! We walked everywhere and even down to Battery Park which was a brilliant walk that took about 1hr 10 Minutes! There is a subway station only a few hundred yards from the hotel. We were so glad of the location being slightly away from Times Square as it's just pandemonium there! The hotel - is a new hotel and only opened September 2017 and that is apparent through the hotel as everything is new and clean. On approaching the entrance to the hotel there is loud music being pumped out onto the street which I still cannot understand the reason for! As you enter the loud music continues in the lobby however you are greeted with the most amazing smell which turns out to be Moxys own scent that's blown through the lobby. There is no reception desk, it's six white stands where the staff book you in on a laptop. The staff are very welcoming on entry but none of them wear a uniform it's just their own clothes! Check in was simple and we were given a Queen Room facing the front of the hotel on the 10th Floor. The lift key operates the elevator for security so even if there is a waiting lift you can't get into it without pressing your floor and scanning your key as the lifts only stop at the floors where keys have been scanned! It's very simple to do but can be a nuisance when you are carrying things and your key isn't always handy! Room - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY if you are booking this hotel! If you are travelling MORE than 1 person and have more than 1 Bag DO NOT book a standard double room it is TINY! The Queen Room was only big enough for 2 of us as we were there for only 4 Days and only had 1 suitcase! There is nowhere to store your suitcase in the room and only enough room and hangers to hang up 2-3 pieces of clothing on the wall! Our room had a massive bean bag in the corner and to be honest we would rather it wasn't there so we had somewhere to put our case rather than it being in the middle of the floor! The sink is in the room outside the bathroom. The shower in the room is the best Iv ever been in, the rain shower pressure is just amazing and after walking about all day it helped the aching muscles!! I said I feel that is hotel is confused, well here is why...... We are both in our mid 30's and on arrival there was loud music being played out to the street??? I felt like I was approaching a city centre Night club in the 2000's and that's also what the sign outside looked like! On entry to the lobby it was like entering a nightclub, we liked it but could see others entering wondering what they had just checked into! There are men standing about the elevators in black coats exactly like you would see in a nightclub so again it feels like a niteclub experience every time you enter and leave the hotel! We were able to hear the music being pumped outside the entrance to the hotel in our 10th floor room till about 2-3 am AND the nightclub on the roof till about 4am! Moxy there is no need to be playing music out to the street after 8pm as you should be considering your guests who may wish to relax in their rooms, yes there may be traffic noise from the street however we expect that in NY! The night club on the roof is also having an effect on your guests with the noise till 4am and mostly being attended by NON hotel guests.The Moxy is a fabulous hotel and lovely inside however in my honest opinion guests getting a good nights sleep is clearly not high up on the list of the hotels prioritys and that's why I say that this hotel is confused as to what it is supposed to be. It's simple things that need to be addressed to be more guest focused rather than making the place a party Palace all the time.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","MJM2629</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",115,4.0

This newer hotel has a great location (7th Ave and 36th St.) for anyone wishing to be near Macy's (1 1/2 blocks away), or near Penn Station which provides Metro or LIRR service. You are only blocks away from 42nd St and Times Square. Loved the location. Our room was very small with a lofted bed for the 3rd person (steps to the lofted bed are very steep and that bed was hard). The double bed was pretty comfortable but because the head of the bed tucks under the loft be aware that you may easily knock your head if you are not very careful! Rooms have different configurations from the one that we chose ... We needed enough space for 3 people and as I said the room was really small. There is no closet but many hooks on the wall. There is no frig or microwave. The sink is located within the room (not in the bathroom). The bathroom was ok and the shower was hot (watch your step into the shower as it is a definite step down). There is a room called ""the stash"" where you can go to get extra linen or towels, etc. which was nice. You need your room key card to access the elevator from any floor including the lobby which is an interesting safety measure which I did get to like (no buttons to push in the elevators). 4 elevators were very quick. Staff were young and personable and very happy to help. This hotels has a rooftop bar area which opens at 4 pm and stays open late -- definitely attracts the under 50 crowd! The second floor of the hotel houses a large lounge area, a bar, a restaurant and food available for purchase.

My hotel room was adequate although the bed, boxed in on both sides, was a clear meter from the back wall which made it very difficult to close the blinds which were behind the bed head (and was a rather strange waste of space in a reasonably small room). I had to almost fall over the back of the bed to close them down. Checkin was very straight forward and in fact they let me check in early which was kind. It is a reasonably modern place - a bunch of mini desks with staff sort of milling about so it’s difficult to know where to wait before getting someone’s attention. Also, I did have an interesting exchange about there location of a place for breakfast - clearly there is no place within the hotel for breakfast but despite asking several times, this was not made clear until the third request! It’s fine, just say so and point in the right direction for the closest diner.

Really disappointed that there wasn’t really a Christmas decoration for our entire stay (we left on Christmas Eve...), but I can get over that. The bed was amazingly comfortable, though the first night sleep was disturbed by a lamp under the bed on a sensor which I managed to turn off for the second night as it kept randomly coming on. The room is cosy and it was exactly as expected - we had a queen room and loved it! Loved the whole feel of the room itself! One of the reasons we booked was for the rooftop bar as it seemed really appealing - but as per my review for the bar the staff were so rude it left a lasting impression on the Moxy brand for me which is quite bitter. The location is good (there’s a Dunkin Donuts right next door too!) and even though it’s not the quietist (but where is in NYC?!) the sleep was great and there are ear plugs provided if you want them!

Also I sent my cleaning in the first night (19-21 Dec) and asked where it was the next evening only to find out it was not sent out. The manager said she would clean it herself (it was my uniform) and she did but the pants are now falling apart since she washed them in a machine. I was trying to sleep early and could not because of the noise and eventually had to move to another room. It was better without the DJ in my room from the rooftop but still a lot of street noise.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the strong smell (wasn't bad), just a strong fragrance that hit you. You get a free drink token on check in, (doesn't have to be used for an adult beverage, although we did). Overall feel of the hotel in general was modern, and trendy. The access to the rooms with the elevator is secure using your room key for access. The rooms are really cool, but on the smaller side. Didn't really matter to us, cause everything you needed in a traditional hotel room was there, and made the most of the space provided. The only draw back is that it could be noisy, but it's expected when you're on located on 7th Ave. in NYC. They do provided ear plugs in the room as well.

There is a terrific bar area on the 2nd floor where you can have drinks and snacks while lounging in comfy sofas. The location is a prime spot in midtown, walking distance to the Theater District, Times Square and 34th Street shopping area, without being close to the grittiness of Port Authority. The staff is friendly and helpful. You can get a room with 2 sets of bunkbeds, which my college-aged kids liked a lot.But this is not a typical Marriott property. It seems to be Marriott's answer to minimalist-style hotels, such as The Pod and Yotel. The rooms are very small. There are no closets or dressers. You'll find some drawers under the bed and hooks lining the walls, as well as a beanbag chair, and a trendy folding table and chair. There is no coffee in the room. If I had been here for business, I would have been typing in my bed. The bathroom door and shower wall are glass with some kind of screening within the panels to obstruct a clear view. Even so, my kids did not feel is was sufficiently private (and the slider to the bathroom did not fully close, leaving a small crack - maybe a half inch - that others could see through).Our room was very noisy due to the combination of the rooftop bar (which Marriott can help) and the street (which it can't). The Moxy brand, in general, tries a little too hard to attract the Millennial crowd.

No complaints. It did try to be a little to hip for my liking but bear in mind I am about as un-hip as you can get. The rooms were smallish but nice, the shower was bigger than most I've had in New York and I did like the tile work. The thing that scared me a little was there were ear plugs on the nightstand next to the bed. We ended up really needing them. My complaints are really about New York more than this hotel in particular. First off, they have no parking - which is OK - but neither do they have an arrangement with a local garage - which is not. I was expecting to pay about $55 for my one night stay. Well, the rates were $59. Oh, and its $12 more for an SUV. So the guy tells me $71. When I went to pick up the bill is $128. $71 plus $46 for one hour extra and $11 for 3 minutes over the hour. Sure, my fault for not reading the small print but that's why most hotels have arrangement with garages - so their customers don't get taken advantage of. I'm a lifetime Platinum and I still get taken to the cleaners like this on occasion and it is very frustrating.Secondly, the hotel was $400 per night. I know, New York is expensive. (The shows are expensive, the food is expensive, the shopping is expensive.) That's the going rate. But if I'm gong to spend that kind of money I expect something exceptional. Well, at least better than average. And the fact is you need to spend a whole lot more than $400 per night in December to get an average hotel that would be below average in most other big cities.

Management and customer service are horrible - they do not care, rather than treat you like a guest, they treat you like an inconvenience. HORRIBLE Experience.I actually dig the small rooms, and the art museum feel. I don't mind the loud music, and like the boutique feel. However, customer service is still the back bone of the hotel industry, and Marriott prides itself on treating it's guests (and members) first class - THIS HOTEL DOES NOT!","Dallas, Texas","jayfinnigan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",3,1.0

We checked in and went to our room to get ready to go to dinner. First thing we notice was that the room was an oversized closet with no actually closet. Then the sink was clogged, but we were excited to be in New York and left for dinner. We informed the front desk that the sink was clogged. We returned late that night and observed security screening the elevator to the rooftop bar. We proceeded to the guest elevator where you have to program your room number and it tells you what elevator to get in. While waiting in the lobby my husband saw a young lady avoiding security and get in our elevator. She sneeked into the elevator and rode It up to the 17th floor and started panicking and texting whoever she was meeting. I’ll let your imagination figure out what she was doing there. The point is that the hotel is more interested in the rooftop bar than their guest, anyone has access to the guest rooms.Now back in our room the sink was still clogged overflowing clogged. While taking a shower we noticed the water warm and no hot water. The shower would not shut off completely and we listen to the drip of the shower the entire night and morning. Being a rewards member we asked to get a late check out, but they said the hotel was full and denied our request. We’ve never been denied a late check out at any Marriott hotel full or not. We gave the two stars because the employees were pleasant and they stored our bags while we waited to transfer to another hotel to another Marriott.We advised the PM supervisor and AM supervisor their response this is Marriott new concept not for everyone. But Customer Service and follow up on maintenance issues has nothing to do with the new concept..In conclusion, we read other reviews about the noise, but it did not bother us. The hotel knows it has serious problem when they supply/issue earplugs to hotel guest in the rooms.The hotel should be marketed for young people or backpackers, who don’t care about the traditional or customer service hotel, but if Marriott did that, the hotel would be empty. What a waste of 40,000 reward points for us.On the Marriott website we gave our feedback but Mr Murphy sent back a generic response about our concerns.

I sat in my window and people watched every day. If you don't like noise, don't stay in the heart of Times Square.- Not really for a business traveler. I would say it's more for leisure and fun! There's no writing tables or chairs to work in.

Personally, I found it to be a fine place to sleep, but not spend much time in the room, that was tiny and, in my particular case, a small window faced a brick wall 15' away. But it felt and looked clean and new, everything seemed to work well (though the hot water, even on full hot, was a bit cool for a shower). Breakfast Naan was lackluster, but the other to-go food choices seemed nice. My room was away from the street and so apparently a bit quieter than others. This was great value in central NYC for $100-$150 but if the price creeps up, I think one would need to consider other properties.

I had the pleasure of staying at the Moxy NYC when it first opened up back in September. My friends wanted to stay here because it was new and because she liked the industrial feel to the rooms. What that means is that the rooms themselves, while not large by any means, are functional and get the job done. They have a million hooks (typical of a Moxy) and they believe in having chairs that can fold up and be hung, rather than take up space in the room. Like I said, very functional. I'm more of a standard hotel visitor - I like my space, my chairs, etc. But my friends loved the hotel. What was a bit strange and funny was that I think they were trying to make it a sort of club experience. The door guys felt like bouncers, as did the elevator guys. The bar on the 2nd floor is pretty cool - as you feel like you're in a hip bar. The DJs play awesome music (think pop hits from various decades), so Moxy did a great job there. The location is near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The 1/2/3 subway line is like two blocks away, which made getting around pretty easy. There are plenty of eateries and delis and restaurants nearby as well. Really, it's a great location and you won't feel unsafe in being in that area, even late at night. They were working out some kinks so I'm sure the hotel is much better now than it was when we went. But even so, it was pretty great. The best - absolutely fantastic - part of the Moxy NYC Times Square? The staff. I can't say enough about Anthony who took care of us from start to finish, who never stopped smiling and being friendly. Emilio was fantastic too, taking care of whatever problems we had. At one point he got frustrated our tv wasn't working, and I think it's because he really cared about having it work for us. Really, an amazing staff. If you get either of those guys, consider yourself lucky. Anthony made our stay that much more amazing, so thank you Anthony.Overall, I very much recommend this hotel, especially if you're in NYC to have a good time. This may not be the hotel for business travelers, or families. But if you're looking to take on Manhattan with friends, you'll love the Moxy NYC Time Square.","Sacramento, CA","TheVyster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, CA</strong>",4,4.0

Loved the great location, the compact but unique/stylish rooms (which I want to copy now at home... especially the bathroom) and the irreverent and trendy nature of the whole place. If you're like me, you've stayed at hundreds of other big-brand hotels that have basically been exactly the same, save for the name, the location, and maybe a more comfy bed, here or there. Unless you truly value that Hikton/Marriott/Starwood sameness - or expect lavish treatment, staff fawning, sedate elevator music, and a luxuriously spacious room, you will likely be pleased with Moxy. If you even question if you need those things, don't stay here. (That means more room for ""us."" Thanks, in advance.)My wife and I (50ish.. somewhat over the target age, but lovers of design) couldn't have loved the hotel more - in town to visit our NYU senior (5 minutes walk to subway.. 5 minute train to NYU) and catch a show off nearby Times Square (5-10 minute walk)... From an unexpectedly ready room at 10 a.m. on Saturday - to a very quiet 10th floor room (save for a noticeably squeaky nearby elevator #3, mostly drowned out by the white noise we - and everyone - should be sleeping or anyway), to a surprisingly convenient location in a modest but lively area I have mostly cut through in the past) - the hotel surprised. (Unknown to what degree, if any, my Marriott Plat status played in room readiness or quietness, but I am guessing little in a big city hotel likely full of those with similar or higher status... which more uber-picky and whiney (see reviews below) frequent stayers ought to come to grips with...)Some positive callouts: Super room design w/wood(look) floors, sleek sink and little wasted space. Amazing looking, tall, shower stall with the best high volume waterfall shower head you will EVER use (water conservation types will NOT like... We loved.) Nice lighting choices and convenient outlets. Soundbar on wall. Glass in door to hall! (We adjusted shade to let just the right out of light in....) Great looking 2nd floor lounge and bar space with windows to street. Hard plastic glasses in room (vs glass or disposable plastic). Hooks on wall!The only minor things that I should point out, that some might not like but mostly are just different vs ""standard"" hotel: 2 pillows on Queen bed for 2 people and no more in room storage (we like more... And sure I could ask, but...). One combo comforter/sheet on bed. (A bit odd but worked.) Washclothes positioned right under shower head so they get soaked! An interesting but nice cream soap/shampoo combo (worked!) Under-bed storage that is useful BUT which juts out right at toe levle (ouch!!!). And in our room 1025, a headboard pushed out about 6 inches from wall, which gave no room for anyone to pass by on foot of bed/to window without climbing over bed. (Pictures of other rooms seem to show OK room to move at end of bed in similar rooms that ours did not have). Steamer instead of iron, but so what. One tiny wastebasket.. But those are nit-picky.All in all - a wonderful stay in a hotel WE loved and you may, too.

Pros: The shower is great! A lot of usb socket for charging your phone. The WiFi is free and the TV is great. You can connect your phone to cast on the TV using ChromeCast.Cons: The room is small, like all other Manhattan hotels. It is OK for this price range. There is a lot of noise, from the street.

The TV allowed you to connect your Netflix account to it and sound bar. Also the beds were extremely comfortable.

On Sunday morning, John and Yakima were kind enough to print out my resume and gave me a folder and a pen for my school event. They were very helpful and wished me good luck.

I'm young, and I don't mind going out and having a good time. I understand a hotel near times square is going to be noisy, and I understand space is a premium. The rooms are noisy and small, and that is not my complaint at all. I'm just sad that Marriott has their name on this hotel because it is one of the worst experiences I've had with the brand. I've stayed in much nicer hotels that weren't nearly half as pretentious. Staff going out of their way to make me feel bad for the way i dressed, or for asking for something as simple as an ice bucket. If you go to a Ritz-Carlton and ask for a bucket of ice, they ask what room you are in and when do I want it. Here, they tell me to go to the bar on the second floor but advise me it's kind of low brow and looked down upon. There is a grab and go snack and drink bar but no one to cash you out. You have to go to the bar. I asked to charge a sparkling water to my room,a nd the bartender asked if I had cash and said ""It's only 3 dollars ok"". What kind of service is that? I'm fine with helping make someone's job easier. There wasn't everyone there, but I'm sure she was busy with prepping for the night. Just ask it bluntly instead of trying to shame me into it is all I ask.Marketing in hotel brands has never made much sense to me. Starwood falls into this trap a lot trying to sell lifestyles instead of rooms. That's exactly what they are doing here. If all you want to attract are rich young partying millennials, they have better options than this too. The reason for 2 stars instead of 1 are the security workers who were outside the main lobby at 1 AM were very friendly and I was given a token for a free cocktail at the 2nd floor bar that was delivered and wasn't watered down or anything like that.","Boston, Massachusetts","BillA1777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",2,2.0

First impressions of the hotel were that it was really cool. The building looked ace and the pink neon sign was inviting. It was also very comforting on days of lots of walking to see it in the distance and know we were nearly home! It’s quite dark inside and even smells nice! I always said it smells like the lush shop when you walk in. The staff were helpful and always welcoming when you walked in. I will say it was a little difficult to tell who was actually staff and who were guests waiting in the reception. We were offered a lower or a higher room and we chose higher. We got the 15th floor. The room was small but we thought it was really cool. Very modern. Everything was hung on the wall, even the small table and chairs which were a nice touch. We were really pleased with the tv, it was of good size and had Netflix which we logged into my account and enjoyed US Netflix on quite a few occasions. There was also a sound bar but we couldn’t figure out how to connect our phones to it. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were also of good quality and always clean. As with the towels and toiletries, good quality. The bed however was on like a stand kind of thing which doubled as storage and to get in you really needed to go from the bottom and crawl up. Fine for us but something to consider. The tv was also on the right hand side of the wall and we felt it would have been nicer in front of us maybe on a bracket you could swing out from the wall. The toilet was funky decorations, clean and the shower was of good size and was powerful. Also provided was a hair dryer and a steamer to iron clothes which we thought was cute and did use and it worked well. There was a bar in the hotel which when checking in you get a free drinks token. We did go to have our drink and the bar area is really nice, very modern and sophisticated. The complimentary drinks we got unfortunately, were not very nice. The bar had lots of nooks to sit in and a foosball table which we had a shot of and enjoyed. The staff were nice. There is also a rooftop bar and a seafood restaurant but we visited neither. My only complaint about this hotel was the noise. As we were near the top I think the noise was coming from private functions at the rooftop bar and on quite a few nights I was woken or couldn’t sleep due to the thumping music. The hotel do provide earplugs however I already wear earplugs and could still hear through them. We met a few guests in the lifts etc and some were older and said they couldn’t wait to get out of the hotel and that they felt the hotel was ‘too cool’ for them. The rooms were always cleaned to a very high standard. Fresh bedding towels etc daily. You have to put a sign on the door if you want the room cleaned which is a nice touch if you want your privacy. There is also the traditional hanging door sign do not disturb but also a button you press on the door which changes the colour of the light outside the door to alert people not to disturb you. The location of the hotel is great and it doesn’t take long to get to many main attractions. We were just 0.3 miles from the Empire State Building. There are plenty of restaurants, delis and small shops near by. One thing we would have really liked was a small fridge in the room for keeping drinks in. We really missed this and bought ice a few times to put in our sink and chill drinks but it was a bit of a carry on to keep doing this. Overall the hotel was cool and we were happy. We thought it was good value for money especially at this time of year and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you.

It was our first and last Moxy. Despite personally calling the hotel 2 times the reservations were still wrong, and they were simple reservations. Was treated poorly upon arrival. When we would call or use the chat function for service there was no answer. The rooms are like the new Motel 6, all cheaply made and sparsely furnished. None of the amenities promised were available. There is no lobby so you have to stand while you wait for others in your party to come down, or wait for taxi to arrive, etc.. And there is almost no room to stand so you are in the doorway or in everyone else's way. Agents are sloppily dressed, without name tags, and do not greet you so you have no idea who works there and who doesn't. Rooms were very cold and no extra blankets in hotel. Could hear the noise of the bar to include conversations through the vent in the guest room, and then since the surfaces are all hard it amplifies as the bar sound bounces through the room. No door man to help get a taxi, no one answers guest requests. Hope you are strong because what little furniture is in the room you have to lift off the walls. The cut corners on everything, no top sheet on the bed, no shampoo, just a body wash, not enough hangers in the room, etc..

Moxy is the latest new brand for Marriott and is designed to appeal to the hipster/ millennium generation and want to be very tech savvy. I have stayed in Moxy's in Munich and Vienna and was treated like a Marriott platinum member so I was excited to learn of the Moxy opening in NYC and as a frequent visitor to the city decided to stay at the NYC Times Square property. Arriving on a Friday afternoon there was no greeting, no thank you for being a member from the non smiling check in person and was handed a room key with a enjoy your stay. When I asked about breakfast I was told on the 2nd floor and the bar transitions to a breakfast area. The room faced the street and was noisy and when you noticed disposable ear plugs on the bed stand you know you are in trouble. Yes noisy all noitw with a draft coming thru the windows or vents, no need to turn the cold water on in the shower as the hot water turned all the way did its best to provide luke warm water, the sink is on the outside and is in the small bed area and no hand lotion! Room is small, with only 1 access point to the bed, one can think trendy but very Ikea like with no closet only hooks. I thought about complaining but realizing this is not designed for a mature adult and given the non challant welcome I did not bother. Even on checkout no one asked did you enjoy your stay? The main feature of the hotel is a roof top bar with people lining up to enter at night and you begin to think the hotel portion is secondary to the rooms, I will return to other Marriot properties on my next visit.",Michigan,"schaefcand</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",51,3.0

It's definitely not a room designed for hanging out in...but you're in NYC, so why would you need to hang out in your room.

I was a bit skeptical at first because the scaffolding signs made it look like the clientele would be extremely ""hip""... which is not exactly me, but I decided to give it a shot since it's new -- and I'm so glad I did!During my stay, I ran into a good mix of people in casual attire, as well as people who seemed like they were there strictly for business. Yes, the trendy music and the overall design can be a bit intimidating to ""non-millenials,"" but it is new & clean, got everything you need, and in a great, great location!My highlights:- Second floor bar/lounge. At least for my Wednesday night stay, this space was super spacious. Had no problem finding a comfortable place to sit down, there was no pressure to order a lot of food/drinks, there was a somewhat more lively area (bar), more cafe-style area (near the atrium), quiet study area, and small group loungey area... - Rooms: I loved the rooms and the super efficient design. The shower/bathroom was spacious (cool bath products), and the bed was clean and comfortable. There were electric outlets AND a lamp switch on the wall next to the bed -- how did you know I never leave the bed for anything but bathroom? Ok, so did I need anything else? Not really. The bed had a nice headboard that worked like a sofa. I don't like sitting on hotel sofa chairs anyway (I think it's gross), so the bed with washed-linen worked perfectly. Also, I really liked that there was none of those magazines/welcome letter/etc in the rooms, so I didn't have to ""custom-reorganize"" when I checked in. - Rooftop bar: I just checked it out cuz I had heard a lot about it.

We’ve stayed at a different Moxy and numerous Marriott hotels in the past. Incorrect charges when we arrived and couldn’t check us in for ages. Three staff tried to figure it out and then the manager came out. She acted like we were a massive inconvenience and didn’t apologise. As it turns out I paid the full rate up front but lady on phone manually entered incorrect amount when I was paying. You guys couldn’t figure this for about an hour. Guys I pay to sleep in a hotel and that was just impossible!! The very basic thing of a hotel that you aren’t able to fulfill. It’s a joke. Noise was just utterly ridiculous every night we were there. It was Like sleeping in a night club. I get there was a rooftop bar and I was totally okay about the noise on the launch night. No issue with that. But zero sound proofing made it impossible to sleep every single night. The room would vibrate. And it’s not fair to come back with some reply like “the Moxy isn’t for everyone” which I’ve seen you guys say on trip advisor when people made same complaints. I’m young and like to party but this was just laughable. We even called reception one night to see if something could be done. But the guy on the phone apologised and explained you have no control over what the rooftop bar do. He explained he had slept in the hotel a few nights previous and totally agreed that the noise was insane and he got no sleep himself. He was super nice to be fair to him. Not his fault.To make it even funnier staying at the Moxy gave us no priority access at all to this Roof bar which kept up till 3/4am every night (magic room or whatever it is called). We were still made go out in the street and queue and the door staff were extremely rude. Also - there was only one towel to share between us when we first arrived (jet lagged and feeling dirty from a long flight). Despite it being clear on the booking that it was for two. We even told you guys it was our anniversary. Finally, we went down to the bar Moxy one night and ordered a Beer and a Prosecco. It came to about 22 dollars which my I signed for. Somehow my visa was charged about 42 Euro for this (converts to about 55 dollars) and then on checkout the staff tried to bill me for those same two drinks AGAIN. A couple of the Moxy staff couldn’t figure it out, and again like when we checked in the manager had to come, didn’t apologise, didn’t fix anything and mumbled about a refund for the over charge - which i still haven’t received. Generally the staff were really rude, with a couple of exceptions. I’ve never complained to a restaurant or hotel in my entire life, so I actually feel pretty bad/sad even writing this.Didn’t really mind the small rooms and thought the shower was great. Tv also worked great and had good channels. Trying to talk about the positives but that’s about it. ",,Sarahwhite3,8,1.0

Check in was super efficient and unlike most hotels where they wave you off to the elevator, the employee walked me to the elevators, showed me how the security worked and bid me a good stay. One of the best check in experiences I have had anywhere in the world. The room (421) was more spacious than expected with lots of hooks to hang clothes. The bathroom was very functional and the shower was fantastic with lots of water pressure. I did notice the air conditioner unit was a little bit noisy and like anywhere in the heart of Manhattan there was some noise from the street but these are very minor points in an otherwise great hotel.

Upon arrival we were given the wrong type of room. At first we were told there were no other rooms as it was the grand opening night and they were booked solid. Hours later someone finally helped us switch rooms -even though they were “booked” (it was the only help we had received.) Walking into the room was like walking into a tiny cubicle. If you like privacy taking a shower or using the restroom, this is not the hotel for you! The thin glass panel across the entire bathroom was a great touch to the small room with 2 beds end to end. We were given wrist bands for the grand opening for the bar and party they were holding. We were told many different times on when it would start like 4pm, 6pm, and 9pm. We made our way back from our plans early to check it out and everyone we asked had no idea what the wristbands were for, or even what was going on! Spent all night running around to different people that the previous person sent us to that would supposedly know what was going on. Did that for about an hour until we gave up and went to the rooftop bar where we sat for at least half an hour AT THE BAR front and center. No one acknowledged us sitting there, never offered to take our order, or better yet make eye contact. Finally when we flagged someone down, we were told she was sent up from the second floor bar and was no longer taking customers. We gave up and went back to our room where all you could hear all night was the party going on upstairs. Yes I understand it’s an opening party, that’s fine, but we should have been told in advance to booking. The following nights I assumed the noise level would stop.....NO! It was loud constantly from the rooftop and on the streets below. Thicker windows would have fixed all. We ended up staying here multiple nights and when we got the print out the prices were all wrong. Spent 2 hours between being on the phone with Marriott and at the front desk. The rates changed 3 times within 10 mins and have 3 physical print outs to prove it. This is the most unorganized hotel I have ever stayed at and not a single employee communicates with each other and have absolutely no idea on what’s going on. Management is no help and tell people they are too busy at the moment to help you with your problems. Any discrepancies shown they immediately go to help another customer. I understand and respect the customer service aspect of things completely but that also doesn’t mean you abandon the one standing and talking in front of you. Needless to say this was the worst part of the New York trip and if you’re wanting to be treated kindly like a human being, I would recommend another hotel. The next hotel we went to two streets over have a friendly staff and have their stuff together. The room is also quiet!",,kaylafaggans,8,1.0

The refined, streamlined modernity of this hotel did not skimp on comfort or customer service. Our hotel room (toe-to-toe double beds) was a trip. In a sense it was a blast from the past-- I felt like I was at the adult version of a sleep-away camp with all the adultish necessities (perfect for a girls trip). Earthy colors, a wool runner, and a heavy canvas window covering on the front door are just a few cool touches that brought me back to my childhood camp experiences. The beds were super cozy, the blackout curtains a major plus and the awesome shower made this hotel room a treat. Now about customer service--- honestly nothing short of amazing! Johnny and Jocelin treated us so well and we loved seeing them in our comings and goings, getting their suggestions and asking them for help with whatever we needed. They were so kind, fun and helpful. Erica and Erica at the bar (either for breakfast or happy hour) were so sweet and took great care of us. Francis and Samantha at the rooftop bar made great suggestions for food and dranks and made us feel as if we were their only customers.

Yes, this is midtown NYC so we weren't expecting a country retreat but we were really not expecting to be woken in the middle of the night by blaring music coming through almost paper-thin windows with absolutely no sound insulation. To add insult to injury on our penultimate night we were woken up by 3-4 false fire alarms - that's fine - but there was absolutely no explanation or direction by staff as to what was going on and so after each false alarm having been told to return to our rooms we felt nervous not really knowing if it was the real deal this time or not. I understand that this is a new property and there will be teething issues but I strongly feel that fire safety and evacuation procedures should be reviewed here as a matter of urgency.Pros: The employees were nice albeit perhaps a bit too blasè and indifferent to the needs of guests. The bedroom was funky with nice little touches. That said, the TV and speaker system was too close to the end of the bed. I'm 5ft '11 and every morning we found the speaker had been knocked off the bracket by my feet which was also partly down to the fact it had not been secured fastly. The bed itself was super comfy, just a shame we couldn't rest in it properly because of the incessant noise. The bar/s were cool and we appreciated that we were given priority access over non-guests. Summary: Overall, I feel there is a lot of potential at the Moxy Times Square but there are serious issues with sound/noise disturbance mentioned above and a worrying lack of attention to detail with fire evacuation procedures.","London, United Kingdom","DBNORTH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",17,2.0

They were clearly NOT ready to open. On the upside, the beds were very comfortable and the large shower were well done. But, after calling Marriott several times the month, a week, and then two days before arriving and being told it would be ready, we walked into full-scale construction, only several floors open, and no restaurant or highly-publicized roof top bar. We had problems with air-conditioning not working and high noise coming through the brand new street-side windows. We asked for simple things like bottled water and some extra towels and they never arrived. Our frustration after two days hit the max and we went to the on-site manager. They offered to move us to another Marriott property, but the job of packing up and moving ourselves further away from Times Square wasn't much of an offer. Upon checkout, they offered to put a few additional points on my Marriott Account (too little, too late) and then never followed through. Eventually I received an email from the 'Director of Happiness' (no joke) saying they were sorry my stay wasn't very good. They then signed off with a 'Stay Fab' closing. I felt badly for the on-site staff who were trying hard to make up for shortfalls that they had no control over. At a minimum, Marriott should have leveled with loyal customers like us who, when calling to see the status of the new property, should have been offered some type of honest answer and then either given a discount for being the new guinea pigs, or offered to be move BEFORE being subjected to such poor treatment. The Moxy brand is designed to be hip and the demographic is certainly for the trendy ... but, at the end of the day, the 'cuteness' approach (marketing) and loud music 24X7 in the lobby can't mask poor preparation.

The rooms are very well appointed simple and stylish - huge Flat Screen TV, fast wifi,lots of outlets for adapters, terrific towels and the bed is very comfy. There isn't a lot of room for storage but there are cool looking hooks all over below the bed is a large storage drawer. Rain shower in the bathroom was great and the custom ceramic sink was really nice. As a matter of fact all the ""finishes"" were nice including the hardware. There is a very hip bar on the roof - apparently its the largest outdoor bar in the city. It has a terrific view but it does get really crowed. Hotel guest have some sort of preference. Definitely worth checking out. On the second floor there is a bar and restaurant. and plenty of communal places to open u your laptop and work.They weren't serving full breakfast yet but they have a grab and go (fruit, yogurt muffins etc) which was fine with me. Workout room is nice on the lower floor.Will definitely be back at the Moxy!",Los Angeles,"STONECARAVELLE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",9,5.0

This hotel is definitely a hip joint. The hotel and rooms are stylishly designed and curated. Perfect hotel for those who are traveling light (no closets in the room, but plenty of creative storage and hanging options). Service was quick and courteous, the room was very clean and surprisingly spacious for NYC. We were given two drink tokens to be used in the second floor bar (tokens were only good for the ""welcome"" cocktail which was delicious). Rooftop bar is quite a scene and very crowded, but offers a spectacular view of Empire State Bldg. No coffee maker in the room, but I was able to get free coffee from the second floor bar (there does seem to be some confusion with staff about whether this is complimentary?). Because I need to know where my morning dose of coffee is coming from, I would suggest to Moxy that they go ahead and make this a complimentary thing for all or have a Keurig in each room or by request.On our last night, a fire alarm went off around 4am followed by an intercom announcement that we did not need to evacuate, this happened off and on for a while. We did express concerns to staff the next morning and they made some adjustments to our stay that left us feeling valued.

As Marriott Gold members, we typically stay at Marriott properties for special occasions. To celebrate our son’s 10th birthday, we took him to NYC and booked 3 nights at the Moxy. We entailed the concierge about making the stay special for our son to which we DID get a reply that they would “hook him up”. They didn’t..... they never mentioned it again until we brought it up at check-out. We arrived fairly late at night and things were fine.... the hip and trendy design within the hotel is super cool and our son was loving it.... my wife and I were too until we went to Bar Moxy for a late meal and a drink. My wife quickly noticed that the pillows on the seats had sexually explicit drawings of couples in various sexual positions! (If you don’t believe me, look at the pics of the Moxy website... first page, first pic. You can actually see one of these pillows in the pic!). One of the many reasons we chose this hotel was that our son was excited about putt-putt on the roof!! That’s what it says in the website! What it doesn’t say is that no one under 21 is allowed to go to the rooftop..... and I know why.... because there are large shrubs carved into the shapes of stuffed bears having sex in various positions! Don’t believe me? Another user has already posted a pic on this TripAdvisor site.... I didn’t take a pic for fear that my son would see. This is unacceptable. Like many others, I cannot believe that Marriott corporate allows sexually explicit material in public spaces at their hotels.... I understand provocative marketing and sensual visuals... but in both of these cases, the images and “bear shrubs” are literally people having sex. It’s just a really strange and unfortunate choice. It’s not trendy or cool... it’s in poor taste. I need to mention here that Marriott’s website (where we always book our stays as elite members) doesn’t mention that some of the hotel restaurants were not yet open. The egghead and Legasea were not yet open (which I just wish had been mentioned when booking). As I stated above, the rooftop was off-limits to our birthday boy, leaving us with only Bar Moxy as an eating choice. For future guests, if you are young and wanting to go to a hip rooftop night club in NYC that has some super cool rooms beneath it where you can stay, I sincerely think you would enjoy this place! I really do! We loved the room size and cool uses of space. However, if you are a bit older and have started a family, work hard for your money and are a very loyal customer.... you will not recognize this hotel as a Marriott property and you will be disappointed (if not offended). Let me end on a positive note... we spoke with Felicia upon check out about our disappointment with the hotel experience. She wrote down my comments and made me feel heard. She received what I shared with grace and apology. I assured her that my issues with the hotel were not personal issues with her and she thanked me for that. She made a bill adjustment that I felt was appropriate. Friends at Moxy, I’m afraid in your quest to be cutting edge and access a younger clientele with expendable income, you are a potential liability to loyal Marriott customers. We love new experiences and new design ideas (which you definitely have), but don’t forget to care for your customers who aren’t in their 20’s and looking to party. I offer this review respectively and in hopes that it helps the hotel, the Marriott corporation, and future guests.",,Ryan R,10,2.0

This hotel would be great for people traveling on business who need a place in the hotel to meet informally or semi-formally. This hotel would not be the place for people who bring several wardrobe changes, go to bed early, expect turn down service, in room breakfast, and a shoe shine. There are times I want these services and for those times, I would recommend another hotel.Specifically, I liked the efficient elevators, the minimalist design of the room, and the venues in the second floor living room/bar. The location simply could not be better - near two transportation hubs and not too far from anything.The couple issues I had with housekeeping were addressed by management immediately.Others have mentioned noise and I agree it is a bit noisy if you are going to bed early, but if you are staying out later it will not matter. The only consistently problematic area I noticed is the service at the bar on the second floor. They seem more interested in complaining about their jobs than serving customers. I noticed this 3 days in a row from three different bartenders at different times of day. My advice is this needs immediate attention.Otherwise, I would recommend this hotel for the type of trip and traveler I mentioned above.","Louisville, Kentucky","connectedkeith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",133,5.0

I booked back in late May. We are a family of 4, so we must have two Queen beds when I book hotels. It's pretty hard to find QUEEN beds in NYC! I was intrigued by Moxy b/c of the rooms with four TWIN beds. Perfect for us b/c one kid kicks and clings, and when we share beds, we generally don't sleep well. Four twins gave everyone plenty of space and no bumping/kicking/clinging!! Things we liked:4 twin beds!!Very clean bedding and roomNew finishesLocation was so easy to walk to Broadway (Wicked on 51st) through Times Square for the full NYC experience. Also close to Penn Station (Amtrak) and Subways.Easy check in and check out. (I don't know what that other reviewer was thinking showing up at 11:00 and expecting to check in! Nobody does that.)Quiet room! We did not request a room with a view -- which worked out great b/c we had a room that faced a courtyard! Which meant it had NO street noise. The air conditioning unit does make noise (as is the case at every hotel), but it was better/quieter than any other hotel I've been to. Some hotels are so loud I can't sleep at all. This one was sleep-able.Ledge/light/power for each bed! Loved having the ledge to place my phone on. Loved that the adults could have a little light (lower bunks) while the kids went to sleep with their lights out on the upper bunks.Motion sensing floor night lights! Cool. When you step out of bed, a ring of light around the edge of the floor comes on. Things that could be improved:The music in the elevators was a bit too ""adult"" for us. By that, I mean it is very ""club"" type of music. There was a song playing when we first got in the elevator where the lyrics said something about ""F-word"". They didn't actually say F--K. The lyrics were ""F word."" And the next time it was the song about ""I like big butts and I cannot lie..."" So, I would prefer a different type of fun music. Our kids are 11 and 13, but still, we would prefer Adele or Michael Jackson or Pharrell or something.The sink in the bathroom was slow to drain. I told the person when I checked out. Not a huge deal.More HOOKS needed in the bathroom! We liked all the hooks in the bunkbed area, but there is essentially ONE hook in the bathroom and you need to put your towel on that for the shower. There is a long wall that could use 3-4 hooks on it so that you can put your pj's on a hook while you are taking a shower.Shower door has a design flaw: First, the shower is mighty powerful! So that was good. The design problem is that no matter how your put the door after you get out, the water on the door (from when you were taking a shower) slowly runs down the door and creates a puddle on the bathroom floor outside of the shower. We put the mat down and it was soaked when we came back. Water needs to stay INSIDE the shower. Again, this was not a fatal flaw.Shower design: Inside the shower there was a metal bin holding two clean washclothes. That was great, except that it is directly below the soap/shampoo dispensers and very close to the downpour of the overhead shower. So, once you use the shower, those two clean, dry washcloths are going to be wet and look used when they aren't. Who puts the clean dry washcloths right next to the soap and the shower spray? Poor design. Again, not a huge deal, just dumb planning.A/C unit must have had condensation leaking under the wood floor and coming up between the slats of the floor. Part of the floor near the A/C unit (and the run on the floor) was wet. The A/C was working hard, but I think there is a problem with condensation or leaking that needed to be fixed. As this hotel has only been open 2 weeks or so, there are bound to be some punch list items that are discovered and need correction. Overall, we were very pleased with the concept of the rooms and the convenience of the location. We are definitely not the ""hip"" crowd, but it still worked for us. (We never turned in our drink tokens, but it was nice that they were offered). My daughter is a fan of the ""Tiny Homes"" show on HGTV and she loved staying here. It was clean, quiet and met our needs. Price was also reasonable (although that may be because we booked so far in advance).

I never saw the need to write a review for a Marriott, considering it would just be another five star review on top of the thousands already posted. That all changed when we were unfortunate enough to stay at the Moxy. I think horrific is an overused word, but I don’t know another word to describe our stay there except to say it was horrific. The one thing I can say for sure is that the employees at the Moxy don’t give a s**t about anyone staying at that hotel. They don’t deserve to be in the Marriott family of hotels. I would never stay there again even if it were free. It was the worst Marriott experience I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m embarrassed for Marriott for letting them treat customers the way we were treated. I won’t go into all the detail I would like to go into, because this would turn into a novel. I will only state the truncated version here. Let me start by saying that I’ve never had a bad experience at Marriott and that’s why we are long time members of their elite rewards program. That all changed when we went to the new Moxy on 36th in NYC. My wife and I were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary and chose the Moxy after Marriott emailed us about the new hotel. It was going to be a convenient location for us and we were excited to see a new hotel in the city. We were very early for check in, so we just wanted to drop off our bags that morning. A very nice woman gave us a ticket for our bags and said the room would be ready at 11:00 am. So far so good. We came back at 11:00 and a very angry gentleman told us that the room wasn’t ready and that no one would have told us that the room would be ready at 11:00 since check in wasn’t until 3:00. So at 3:00 we returned to the hotel. This is when the real disaster started to happen. We waited about 5 minutes or so for anyone to show up to one of the kiosks (there is no front desk). The woman waiting in front of us argued with the staff member that finally showed up that her packages were indeed there and she had confirmation numbers to prove it. He was incredibly rude to her and left several times until he finally came back and said that no packages were ever delivered. She got out here email and showed him that two packages were absolutely delivered for her and someone signed for them at the desk at the hotel. Magically he finally came back with the packages. This should have been our first sign to run away from this place. We were then “helped” by a very rude young women named Yvette (I don’t know the spelling since no one wore a name tag). She told us that no room was available. I explained that we were already there twice today and I had a confirmation number. She told us to hold on and then came back and said that no rooms were ready yet. Again, I explained that this was our third trip to the hotel. She asked us to hold on again and went somewhere. Upon returning she magically found a room. I asked her if there were any upgrades available. She gave a scowl and told me that I wasn’t entitled to an upgrade. I didn’t ask her if I was entitled to one, I asked her if one was available. It should be noted that she never mentioned our gold level status, nor thanked us for being members, which every other Marriott in the country does. I then asked to speak to a manager and she rudely said that no manager was available. She gave us a room on the fifth floor. I asked if we could have a room on a higher floor, and guess what? We were nastily told nothing was available. She could not have been anymore unpleasant. We went to our room. The room was a joke. The humidity was so high in the room the mirrors were steamed, the walls were wet with humidity and the bedding was so damp from the humidity that we couldn’t sit on it. At this point we called the Marriott rewards number. We spoke with Sean who was more than understanding. He informed us that there were upgrades available and what we were experiencing was nothing short of ridiculous. He then passed us on to his supervisor, David. David was very helpful, but said there was really nothing he could do, except have a manager from the Moxy call me. A manager did call to tell me that no upgrades available, and there was really nothing she could do except to give me rewards points. (We could see the empty suites across the hall by the way and they stayed empty until we left on Monday, so I believe rooms were available). I expressed my complete disgust with Yvette and said more than once that she should be fired. My concerns seemed to fall on deaf ears.We had a horrible night with NYC traffic noise and a bed so wet, even after running the AC for nearly eight hours, that we had no choice but to try to sleep on top of it. I would have had better customer service at a Motel 6. When we checked out we weren’t asked how our stay was, we were merely given a copy of our bill and sent on our way.

From the minute you walk into the reception area you are greeted with young, smiling faces and a spectacular atrium with a bear mobile of sorts - you really have to see it.We chose the Moxy for our trip because of it's unique room styles. As four ( 2 male and 2 female), unmarried or partnered to anyone in our group, we were excited to find a room which provided two sets of bunkbeds...it was going to be an adult sleepover. However, upon our arrival, this very specific room we had books, was unavailable. We were not happy, but the hotel kindly offered us two queen/loft bunk rooms which were very nice and allowed the girls to bunk together and the boys to bunk together.The rooms are what I would describe as tiny-house chic. Furnishings fold and hang from the wall and the small space is utilized for the largest feel possible. I truly enjoyed the room.The 2nd-floor lounge/bar was filled with multiple unique seating areas allowing for intimate conversation and group focused environments and the coffee was phenomenal! With the venue being new, I believe there is room for training and growth in the staff, but all in all, it was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning.Shout out to Samson and the front desk gentleman who made me laugh at 3:30 am on the morning I had to check out!",South Dakota,"chouckadventure</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Dakota</strong>",59,4.0

We were intrigued by its proximity to MSG which we liked because of some tickets we had and the claim on its web site that it had the biggest and best rooftop bar in the city.We arrived and learned that both the hotel's restaurant AND the rooftop bar were still under construction and not open to guests!Then we checked into what was clearly the smallest ever hotel room we've ever been in.The one tiny table and single folding chair were actually hanging from pegs on the wall. There were lots of pegs which also reflected the fact that there are no bureaus or closets to be used either.The TV was on the wall at the foot of the bed so could only be viewed while either lying down or sitting on the bed and turning awkwardly.the list goes on... even shaving or my wife applying makeup is difficult because there is no light above the mirror above the sink. No refrigerator, too and you need to crawl across the bed to operate the window blinds.some minor changes would help... better lighting above the sink; maybe a larger table that folds up against the wall might help. the tv need either re-positioning or you need to be able to pull it from the wall and pivot it. And maybe some notice when we booked our room about the incomplete construction!!We made the most of it but this is not a room for a couple or for anyone planning a stay of more than a day or two.The staff was all friendly and tried very hard but it was clear that a number of them needed some more experience... we're great Marriott fans and won't let this change our minds.
