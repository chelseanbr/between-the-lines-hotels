The hotel had actually upgraded us from double to king which was nice, but when we saw the room we were a bit disappointed. Alot smaller than the photos look and the windows dont open, we even had a sticker covering the window so we didnt actually have a view at all. Air con from outside was very loud especially during the night but we soon got used to it. Onto the pros, bedding seemed to be changed daily which is a massive bonus but we stayed during the Corona virus outbreak so not sure if they do this normally. Room tidied every day. Rooftop ""bar"" is a complete joke. It's hardly a rooftop at all its tiny and the roof wasnt opened. The rooftop and the downstairs bar both closed during our stay due to Corona virus. Did not get to try the downstairs bar so cannot commend but it looked nice enough. Front desk staff were lovely and friendly. The biggest plus for this hotel is the location-its perfect. Right opposite a shopping centre, star bucks next door one side and subway the other. Few mins walk to central park if that. Right by the subway which is super handy for sight seeing. All in all a nice stay just not as 'swanky' as we were sold and paid for. It was our first time in New York tho so maybe alot of the hotels are like this, small and dingey. We enjoyed our stay and due to location would probably stay here again. NYC was very quiet compared to normal so would love to come back to experience it, once the corona buggers off!!!

The hotel is across the street from the 59th St subway station for the A/B/C/D trains (as well as Time Warner Center) and around the corner from Central Park. I arrived early and Franklin was super friendly and was able to get me checked in before 11! The hotel is newer, but you can tell that the building is a bit old. This doesn't bother me personally as this is pretty typical with NYC hotels, but definitely something to note.

This hotel had the worst service of anywhere I’ve stayed. I tried to contact them before we arrived but they don’t list their phone number on the website. I filled out the “contact us” form a week before we arrived but they never replied.I googled a phone number and called. The person who answered was unfriendly and unhelpful when I asked for a room with two beds. When we arrived they had a note on my reservation about my request but had reserved that room to someone else anyway. I’d have to pay an extra $70/night, or for $40/night we could have a cot.The room was clean but cluttered with all sorts of stuff to buy. It took up half the desk. The fridge was also completely full of beverages to buy, but none of it was cold. There was no space to store our own items.I tried to use the microwave but it wasn’t plugged in, and the cord didn’t reach the outlet. The only option was to pull it partially off the shelf and hold it while using.There are no ice machines on the floor. The front desk instructed us to call room service to have ice delivered to the room, but they don’t provide you with a phone number. We tried to call the front desk for help. Unfortunately they don’t answer the phone - on two different days we tried four times without success. We ended up walking down to the desk with our bucket and asking for ice. (It was filled promptly and delivered to our room.)If you have an iPhone 4, the 30 pin charger on the room’s iHome will be great for you.

Great rate, great location. Hoped for a new spot for frequent future business travel. BUT Service and room quality were a disappointment. This midtown location not up to the standard of this hotel group's other properties or hotels with similar 4+ star ratings. The Details:Room - small even by New York standards. No desk or usable counter surface. This was a bed, bathroom and TV. Workably basic. (Only space in the room besides tiny nightstands and armoire for clothing storage was top of minibar cabinet and it was covered with for-sale items). Cleanliness and Condition of Room. subpar . Dust bunnies in corners bigger than golf balls. Safe broken. On demand TV, down. Some miscellaneous paper garbage from prior guests still in room. Mid century furniture looks great in pictures but in person was chipped, worn and closer to IKEA items after a college student's move than quality furniture.  Service. The real disappointment. Staff was friendly but service quality relative to price point and rating was very very poor. Example: asked about a few hour late checkout....fully understanding it might not be possible if hotel was full. Staff 's answer was to offer to either charge for another night or suggest I use the lobby bathroom to change before travel. Clearly the hotel wasn't full since I could have had the room for another night - but they were not willing to extend checkout for a business traveler by two hours?  It's 90 degrees, humid. Would have been nice to be able to take quick shower and change out of business clothing from a last meeting before going to the airport. I'd have understood if they were full. I'd have happily paid an added fee for a late checkout if that was an option too.... My options were the dismissive choice between - the the lobby bathroom or pay for another full night. Very Disappointing. Final irritation: they charge an amenities/convenience fee of about $35-40/night on top of the rate but it's unclear they provide any such amenities or convenience for this fee. On my trip, Internet was listed clearly as either ""free"" or available at higher speeds for a separate surcharge, the rooftop bar was closed, there is no onsite gym, And no late check out. So that extra fee for Amenities and convenience?? Name what I was paying for, please?Given location and good last minute rate, I can't give a single star. it wasn't a horrible experience but nevertheless, disappointing experience.

Either size room would have been sufficient for the two of us, but with our daughter visiting from time to time the extra room in the suite was a plus. In the suite we had a microwave oven. We would have rather have had a coffee maker, but perhaps that is just a personal preference. C. O. Bigelow Body Wash, Shampoo and Conditioner in the bath was great. Read up on the history of C. O. Bigelow Apothecaries for greater appreciation. The two bathrobes were ""interesting"". Both the same size which I would say is small petite which was fine for my wife, but on me it would have looked appropriate for a SNL skit. Maybe a little more ""one size fits most"" would have been reasonable? This was our second visit to this hotel with a gap of 8 years between stays. The location to Central Park was wonderful.

Definitely felt homey and comfortable. The large picture windows facing the Time Warner Center and the park are a plus, there was a microwave in my room (no coffee machine, but there's a Starbucks next door to the lobby) and the location couldn't be better. Because I didn't have my suitcase for 4 days of the trip :( I had to buy necessities every day, but literally everything I needed was within a block.

He had certain hotels that were allowed per his company and 6th Columbus was one on the list. We have stayed in NYC 7 different times but had never stayed at this hotel & were excited to try it out. The hotel sounded & looked great online. A major selling point was the rooftop bar. However when we arrived on Monday it was pouring down rain - my husband & I were trying to get the suitcases out of the cab but the doorman just stared at us. We took the suitcases & proceeded to walk up the stairs as fast as possible to keep from getting soaked and neither doorman (there were 2) offered to help. We got to the check in counter where the desk clerk seemed too busy to even recognize we were standing there. While I stayed near the couches I noticed another man (I am guessing another doorman although it wasn't clear what his role was) just staring at me. The other 2 doormen were also looking at us which made me very uncomfortable as if we had stumbled into some kind of secret but were not in on the surpise - awkward to say the least. *this happened all 3 times we were at the desk (initial arrival, check-in, & when we left)* I am not sure what is wrong with those guys but as a woman who was going to be alone while my husband was at a conference during the day I DID NOT feel comfortable AT ALL!!!!!The desk clerk told us the room would be ready in an hour so we checked our bags & walked to have lunch. Once we arrived close to 1:30pm we were told that the computers were down so we could not get any keys to the room. The desk clerk also informed us he had no way to upgrade us to any other room even though it was our anniversary (FYI - the new hotel we moved to gave us the BIGGEST suite they had & made a point of doing everything they could to ensure a wonderful stay)A man named Louis ushered us to the room & I must say he seemed nice.When we walked in the room I nearly lost it. I am not easily upset & in fact am very laid back however this room was INCREDIBLY dark, dated, small, and only had 2 very small windows that overlooked another building. I immediately started having clausterphobia. I told my husband we needed to get out ASAP. He got on his computer immediately to try & find another hotel. *FYI: the Wi-Fi was awful in the room!When we went downstairs to check out we spoke to Nicole. We explained our issues with the hotel although I did not voice my concern with the men that made me uncomfortable because they were STARING at us! UGH! I wanted out of that place as soon as possible - it was awful. Nicole was nice enough & honestly we hope they can take some of these suggestions & make this a better experience for future guests.HOTEL OVERVIEW: lobby is very small and dark. The desk clerk was not friendly and seemed preoccupied. The hallways are a DARK blue with dark grey carpet. The room was a dark brown and blue combination. The halls are narrow with only a one person capacity. The elevators are SMALL & we had to share them with the employees (no service elevator) - there were 2 employees in the elevators with dirty towels and sheets as we were leaving which isnt a huge deal but is kinda of gross. Suggestions: If this were my hotel I would give it a total remodel and place white walls with white tile and light grey sofas in the lobby with accent pillows in shades of blue to brighten the place up. The halls need to be some softer shaded of light grey or light blue to reflect light and brighten the place up. The rooms also need to be brightened up - paint the wood pieces a white color and replace the dark carpet with something lighter. The bathroom décor was fine and I loved the dark blue tile. But honestly this hotel needs some work.",,Connorcolesmom,6,1.0

Though the location was convenient, the hotel itself was unacceptable on almost all aspects. The one star is for the accuracy of photos. The lack of any other stars is due to the misleading nature of the photos. Greeting: During a pouring rain, the front lobby staff opened the door but did not offer to help me or my companion with our luggage (up the wet steps). They did give us uncomfortable looks as they sized us up. I did not at all feel safe. The looks were whether we were worth stealing from or worse, assaulting. Check In: The staff was ok, but gave us a glance as though they were extremely busy, though no other person was checking in. Had they said they are wrapping up something and will just be a moment, I could understand the delay and cold shoulder. No apology, no thanks for our visit. No hospitality. Lobby: The area was dark and uninviting for a hotel. It would be great for a nightclub or perhaps an hourly hotel for one night stands, but not for a family or business trip. Elevator: The two of us and our luggage barely fit in the elevator with our luggage. Room: I could step from door to bed, it was that close to the door. The walls were paper thin. I could hear ever conversation of every person in the hall. I could hear every step and every door opening / closing. And, anything said or sound made in the room could be heard from the hallway. Again, if using the room for hourly purposes or a one night stand, it could do. But I'd never recommend this place for a family or business trip, you'd get no rest with the hallway noise and wouldn't feel comfortable having all your conversations heard by others. Value: This is a relatively expensive place to stay given the above. There are so many local and national options to this place. If this were the last room available in the city, I'd probably suggest going to a shelter - you'd feel more safe and not be surprised by the size and lack of privacy.",Georgia,"Craig A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Georgia</strong>",3,1.0

The room price I got was pretty reasonable (< $150/night) and I got a LOT of value for that. The hotel is pretty well maintained, the room was reasonable size, and had a nicely appointed bathroom. It has a rooftop bar, which was not open in March, and is attached to a Japanese restaurant, where you can get breakfast--a pretty good one, too!Pros:- Comfortable bed- Nice bathroom with tub and plenty of water pressure- plenty of outlets (see cons below)- Cooked breakfast with 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns, toast and bacon for $14.50--a great price at an NYC hotelCons:- The room is kind of dark, meaning the lighting needs to be improved- The desk and nightstands are not great quality and have seen better days- The bathroom does not have very good shaving light (this should be an easy fix, right?)- The outlets are all hard to get to. Each nightstand has an outlet inside a closed shelf, so you need a flashlight to see the outlet so you can plug into it. The desk outlets are UNDER the desk, so you need to get on hands and knees to get to them. In 2019 I expect better, but for the price, OK, I guess.The only other oddity is that when I checked in, there were no bath towels, so I had to request them, but they came promptly, so that was fine.Overall, I would stay in 6 Columbus again if I'm in the neighborhood.

The engineer got to my room in a couple of minutes and when that didn't work, he switched me rooms immediately. That was welcome with the 90 degree heat New York was experiencing during our stay! Everyone else at this hotel goes out of their way to welcome you with a smile, like Ceasar at the door. Even though everyone must be working really hard, they always take the time to say hello.

The staff was great, from room service to the desk to the Blue Ribbon restaurant. If I had any critiques, I thought the lighting in the room was a tad dark (though that may be because of my age), and since the window was adjacent to another building, there wasn't a lot of natural sunlight to help out with during the day. The only other issue I had was that, while there was a refrigerator in the room, it was filled to the brim with mini-bar items, so I could barely squeeze in some medications that needed to be kept cool (the desk was also cluttered with snacks, none of which were complimentary). I was almost charged for an item as well, but they quickly removed it during checkout, which was greatly appreciated. The location is great, just steps away from a major transportation hub, plenty of great places to eat, and, if you want to go to a great museum, check out Spyscape, which is just a short walk away.I was also pleased that I was easily able to add an extra night to my stay on short notice.

Our evening started out by showing up to the hotel and being told that our reservation was not entered into the system. The man behind the counter explained that when HotWire reservations come in, they need to be entered manually, and ours must have just slipped through the cracks (I booked three weeks in advance). He said it would just be a few minutes, which was fine, and the manager came out a few minutes later to offer my fiance and I each a free drink at the hotel bar, which was very nice of him. We happily accepted, and our room was ready within about 15 minutes. Unfortunately, that was the high point of our stay.The room itself was tiny. I'd be surprised if it was even 10x15. The bathroom was also very small, and the bed was only a full size, which I had no idea was even an option in hotels in 2018. I understand that it was “hotel chooses bed type"" because of how I booked, but had I known anything less than a queen size was an option, I wouldn't have booked. I'm 6’5”. I can barely fit myself on a full size bed, and had to share one with my fiance in an allegedly 4.5 star hotel.Secondly, we had absolutely no view, our room faced out into the narrow space between ours and another building. Which, again, I know isn't a given, but when I'm expecting a 4.5 star hotel, I expect a bit more than that. Also, our TV’s sound only worked about half of the time, and would cut out and in without warning, which put a little damper on our downtime in the room.Lastly, and most importantly, the facilities themselves were miserable. The walls, ceiling, and door were all paper thin. We got basically no sleep all night. There must have been a water pipe above us, so we were woken up by extremely loud rushing water sounds intermittently. No matter where people were on our floor, it sounded like they were in our room due to how thin the walls and door were. I can also corroborate the reviews of others that the cleaning staff makes a huge amount of noise from about 6 a.m. on for no good reason. And there were some very loud pipes of some sort above our room that basically never stopped making noise all night.Had I been staying for more than one night, I probably would have cancelled and found a different hotel for the second night. As it stands, I just sucked it up.I would also very much suggest that 6 Columbus have its star rating downgraded. The amenities and quality of the room were less than I've gotten in a garden variety Holiday Inn Express.","Hampton, New Jersey","Alex W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hampton, New Jersey</strong>",0,2.0

No view from my 4th floor room. Doormen were often AWOL, I had to stand in the street and (try to) hail my own cab.","Greenville, South Carolina","litespeedchick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenville, South Carolina</strong>",13,4.0

There is a whole Foods across the street if you want to keep some supplies in your room. We usually get a King Superior or King Deluxe room but they weren't available for the full two weeks we'd be there. The hotel gave us a deal on the King Suite instead. It was more than we usually pay, but having that extra room in the morning while my partner slept in was really nice. Next time we'll go for the suite again. In all the rooms we've stayed in, the bathrooms are adequate with enough room to store our things comfortably and not feel cramped. The shower water pressure is tremendous.

I did something spontaneous and used Hotel Tonight at the recommendation of my friend. The reviews were mixed but we weren't going to be in the room much. It seemed like a cool vibe for 199 dollars , I gave it a try. We experienced what some other reviewers complained of . No bellman was present when we pulled up to valet and when we found someone he seemed confused . Check in was ok though the attendant admitted he was new and wasn't sure what he was doing. Interesting ! The room was very small , wouldn't mind that so much but there was a a very small window that was an alley. I felt like I was in a closet . I get we received the lowest room due to the way we booked it but the hotel seemed scarcely occupied why not offer an upgrade ( even for a fee) to potentially secure a new client ? Oh well. The room wasn't as clean as I'd like but I have to admit that they had a very clever use of space from the mini bar to the free standing closet. One night tolerable but I could never stay for more than that. Points of contention were a mildew smelling shower curtain, old robes and dusty furniture .The location was great , which was the saving grace. We enjoyed time warner , shopping on 5th , Nobu 57 etc. very easy access to the subway if you need it and Starbucks and Argo Tea close by for morning drinks and affordable breakfast .

When I looked at the shower closer to inspect I felt drops of water fall on my head - they were coming from the ceiling. Nothing was done about this. The shower was ridiculously small considering three of us were sharing the room. Two people would not have fitted in that bathroom! Moreover after one of us showered the whole bathroom was soaking wet. Don't come here!

Unfortunately, I bought bus tickets on the street from a company called Top Ten and although my experience was ok, I will never use the company again as I saw customers treated very badly and people waited a long time for buses and in some cases missed their bus or cruise.","London, United Kingdom","Inaya7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,4.0

Not that it's a bad thing, it's not. We booked a superior King and got a suite out of the deal, and that means a lot to me. The room seemed fairly clean and is sporting a funky vibe. There's a good amount of space because of the living room, without which the room would be very small. There's no dresser just a wardrobe which held all of our 'hang up' clothes but there really wasn't anywhere to put underwear, socks, etc. Having driven to NYC, one of the first stops was the restroom, and this is where I noticed the first issue (not problem). The toilet handle was hanging off the toilet, so it was unflushable. I'd like to think that housekeeping would have noticed this and called it in, instead of me having to pop the top of the tank and manually flushing so as not to disgust maintenance. NOTE that I spoke to the front desk and this was fixed by the time we returned from our afternoon out. While showering I noticed that the light at the back of the shower was out and that the showerhead was leaking from where it attached to the pipe from the wall. More little things that someone should find upon inspection. Also, there were a few marks on the lightly painted wall, scuffs really. A magic eraser and 5 minutes work would refresh the room. Do these little things outweigh the overall experience...nope, not at all. BTW the restaurant is very very good, enjoy a meal there, and as far as the valet...for those who expect their car to magically appear in 5 minutes...get a grip it's NYC. 55 bucks a night is a good price. Call down for your car 1/2 hour early so it's ready when you need it, and if you are trying to beat the extra day fee, leave enough time.

Back in January 2017 my husband surprised me with Broadway tickets and a night away from the kids by booking a room at this hotel. We had a king deluxe room and it had a private deck. The tub in the bathroom was amazing and the bed was comfy. Last week when wanting to celebrate my 10 year anniversary i decided to call the hotel directly and see what they could offer me. I spoke to a very pleasant guy named Steven, he was very professional and funny. I explained that i wanted to surprise my husband this time and that we were celebrating 10 years of marriage. Steven assured me that he would do his best to make sure it would be one we would never forget. Upon checking in, a nice young lady who's name i cant recall, greeted me and advised me that we were upgraded to the Sixty loft. This is by far the best room they have, its a 2 floor suite and was more like an apartment than a hotel room. It had 2 bathrooms one with a shower stall and toilet and one vanity sink. The upstairs bathroom had a steam shower and double vanity, it was perfect. They have robes and slippers for each guest, a hairdryer, and lots of towels; not much to complain about. If i had to list a negative it would be that the furniture had nicks all over it and that there was no iron or ironing board, also it had recently snowed and no one removed it from the balconies so out of the three balconies i could only utilize one that i was able to force open by pushing the snow away myself, a little bit of an annoyance but nothing worth packing up and leaving over. We ordered room service for breakfast by filling out a card that we left on the door handle and they delivered it at exactly the time we stated on the card. The food was good, basic breakfast; eggs, bacon, potato and toast. It came in a cute bento box and the coffee was good. All in all we definitely enjoyed our stay and will never forget our 10th anniversary. Thank you to Steven for listening and making it happen, to the girl who checked us in for beign so sweet and to Brandon for checking us out with ease and smiles; he was very funny and personable. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the location and proximity to EVERYTHING that NY has to offer and also for its great accommodations and price.

I don't travel as much as I did a couple of years ago, I only make it to New York twice a year now, but 6 Columbus welcomes me back as warmly as they did when I used to go 5 or 6 times per year. From the management down to their employees, everyone is courteous and professional. There is a fine line between courteous, and too familiar, and too professional, that comes out too stiff, but they strike the perfect balance there. Their customer service is one of the best in the industry.The rooms are really comfortable. You have something for everyone. You can get a pod room, the smallest which is greatly designed to a suite that caters to more people, and a bigger budget. They treat all their customers the same, from the smallest rooms to the high rollers. They are represented on the app Hoteltonight which can come out to a great price. And to top it all off, you get Ceasar and Lawrence at the front door to welcome you back and chat with you a bit about your day!","Montreal, Canada","cricri7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",61,5.0

It was a nice surprise. The hallways of the hotel feel like an old townhouse but trendy dark and modern. I asked for a room away from the elevator and stairs and imagine if you had one close (which most of them are), sound could be an issue as it seemed to carry. The room was modern, and very clean, which is the most important thing to me. The only downside was the bathroom. It looked like a 60s chic but I think it just needed remodeling. The tile floor is extremely cold and the bathroom had a weird vibe to it. I can't describe it any other way. The bed was decently comfortable.

Let me also say that my husband and I never complain about hotels/service and usually just say everything is ""ok"" when asked. But this hotel was new to us and we decided to try something new given its great location for our reserved evening plans. We are very familiar with NYC and its hotel prices and usually know what to expect. We booked on the hotel website (NOT a third party which normally guarantees you an inferior room they cannot sell). We entered the tiniest hotel room we have ever been inside of and didn't say anything as we were only there for one night. However the room was exceptionally hot and we needed to put on a stand alone cooling system attached to the bathroom window that was placed inside the tiniest bathroom! The added cooling unit which stood upright (about the size of a human) completely blocked the sink and half the already tiny bathroom. I'm not even sure how a ""boutique hotel"" finds this acceptable? It was more like a cheap ""motel 6"" kind of fix. Again we didn't complain and thought it would just cool down the small room quickly. As the cooling unit was extremely loud, we shut it off after it cooled down the room and went out for dinner. When we came back from the sushi dinner at hotel (very good) to find the room excruciatingly hot. We knew that the weather was going down to 51 degrees for the night so we assumed the room would cool down on its own. After returning to our room, it was boiling hot again! We had to choose between putting on the cooling unit which was so loud we couldn't sleep, OR being so hot we couldn't sleep. Needless to say, neither of us got any sleep on one of our very few nights without the kids. Extremely, extremely disappointing. I actually wanted to just drive back home at 2:30 am so I could get some sleep. When asked the customary ""how was your stay?"" at the front desk when checking out, I let them know about the above and that I had never complained about a hotel in my whole life but this was beyond anything I had ever experienced. Room 64. How could they give someone a room with a clearly broken heating unit and a loud cooling unit? They said that a manager would get back to me but no one ever did. I had also emailed them about my experience the next day when I got received the customary email about your stay, but again, no one got back to me and this was two weeks ago. I'm really not sure why the hotel would place people in this room based on all the problems especially when the hotel was not at full capacity. But based on our very poor experience this hotel, we thought it deserved a warning to others especially since we tried to give the hotel the chance to rectify, remedy or at least explain the situation to no avail.","New York City, New York","pam4us</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,1.0

The second time, we were placed in a room that was absolutely tiny, with a tiny ""full"" (I'd consider it not much bigger than a twin) bed. It was certainly not big enough to fit two adults at all comfortably. When we went to ask the front desk for a different room, they said they had plenty available but we'd have to pay a minimum of $50 per night to upgrade the room. This was extremely unsatisfactory since we were supposed to have a room to fit two adults when we booked, and the hotel wanted to blame it on Hotel Tonight, and Hotel Tonight wanted to blame it on the hotel, so no one was able to help it out and we were stuck in our super uncomfortably tiny room. I get that maybe this wasn't entirely the hotels fault, but at the same time, they were not full and had a bunch of more adequate rooms available, so I really feel they should have waived the upgrade charge and moved us to one of those, and then dealt with the issues with hotel tonight.

Only drawback was the noise in the hallway. The doors are loud when they close. We were able to hear a considerable amount of street noise but that didn't bother us. Check In/Out was quick and efficient. ","Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania","31beechhurst</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania</strong>",10,4.0

There are restaurants within steps of the hotel, shopping right across the street, and you are literally only minutes to Central Park. The room was spotless, the beds and pillows comfy. The only nitpicky thing - the elevators are so dark, was hard to even see the numbers for the floors. But, we never waited for elevators, so that was a plus.

It is across from Time Warner with all of the shops and across Central Park. The subway is right across the street so it is convenient, it's also not far from Time Square if you take the subway. I stayed here on business so I was rarely in the room. The room is very dark though and I didn't open the shade because the window was facing apartment windows and I could see people in the other building. Even with the shade open the room was extremely dark. The room is small, but it wasn't so small that I felt cramped for me the size was fine. The side I stayed on was quiet, wasn't facing the street so that was nice. The issue for me was that the bathroom was made for a very tall person. I could not see in the bathroom mirror, whoever put the mirror up must have been like 6ft tall. Even standing on my tippy toes I barely saw my forehead. I am petite, but I would have thought I could at least see in the mirror! Luckily there was a retractable makeup mirror that I could use. There is also a long mirror but it was so dark I didn't want to use it for makeup and risk looking like a clown. The water pressure was on super high, my skin didn't come off but it was rough. I tried adjusting it but it was either a trickle or high intensity. Because it is so high the water also goes everywhere. It is also very loud, I could hear when the person next to me was showering. The faucet also was strange, I didn't know which way was hot or cold, so I had to let it run for 3 min to figure it out. The sink area is small but there is a shelf above the toilet for all my things. The bed was ok, the AC worked good. I did have a lamp next to the bed that wouldn't shut it off, I would turn it off then I would wake up in the middle of the night and it would be on, it was dim, but odd that it would just come on. There was additional storage under the bed, it had draws which I thought was nice. There was no iron in the room, but I called and got one. There are two elevators, one is small the other is big. I checked in pretty late so for me check in was fast. I checked out early and it was fine also. I did go up to the roof top and it was like a cute covered patio, it wasn't really outside, it was covered with windows, it was cozy and had a nice ambiance. Overall for business not bad, if you aren't going to be in the room much, it's fine. If you're visiting NYC you shouldn't be in your room anyways. Rooms are small, but wasn't crazy small, I stayed in smaller. There is free wifi and paid wifi too, pick free and you get it for a certain amount of hours.

The A/C is powerful and provides a nice buffer if people are talking in the hall. It was very quiet - no street noise. Yes the rooms are tiiiiiiny, the whole place feels a bit shabby and there are no frills to be had here. There's this giant clock-radio thing with an iPhone adapter .. circa 2008. It's not suitable for phones past the 3G. So your dinosaur phone will work but not a current one. Want some ice? They send a bellman to your room and will return with a few cubes. What? Water is free but whatevs.. The bed also is tiny - a ""full size"" mattress, not even queen-sized. If you're tall your feet are going to hang off the end and you and your spouse will need to make adjustments if you're used to lounging in your big ole king size bed at home! A few more shelves would be handy since there's so little storage (plan to stack your suitcase on top of the small wardrobe to save floor space). The rooftop bar was not operating when we were here but it was a nice place to go sit and read the paper. Also: there are bathrooms on the top floor, in case one of you is hogging the bathroom to take one of those luxurious showers!

We did not pay for it, but I am aware of the price of the rooms. This is my 4..5 trip to NYC and my room at the Fairfield Inn back in Jersey would have been preferred in ""some"" cases.I would recommend it to people who want to be near a shopping area and who are not visiting on business. Pluses: the rooftop bar was really cool...drinks kind of expensive.. 12 bucks for pineapple juice with a shot of Cognac, the mini mall across the street including the whole foods, proximity to Central Park and the Starbucks next door. Also the bed was comfortable, the shower was amazing. Loved the tiled walls and heated floors. Free wifi.Minuses: the room was VERY small. My view was dirty inter workings of the air system I believe. No coffee, microwave, refrigerator (one was there stocked that was ridiculous expensive) accessible in the room. Also no iron/board you had to get it from downstairs, the bathroom had no ventilation..thank God for the small window to let the steam out. There was no business center with computers and printers that you could work on, nor gym (you could use one across the street). So thus my title...depending on your expectations...its ok. I've stayed at the Fairfield, the W, the Marquis etc...so I may be shaded. This facility just has a little more work to do to market to my genre...but perhaps I am not the target customer.

We stayed here for one night while in town to see Hamilton (worth every other experience on the trip!!), but were a bit disapointed given the previous ratings and promotion as a luxury hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and ready on time. However, the shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom were not entirely filled which was odd, and the shower had such a slow drain that within a minute or two you were ankle-deep in wash water. The killer though was the sound of the central air unit. Closest approximation is the noise of a small jet engine. This woke us up multiple times during the night and I basically got only 1-2hrs of sleep because on top of this there was a tapping/rattling in the duct that sounded like a very loud and irregular clock. We reported this and the front desk said maintenance would take a look. In such an old building though not sure how much can be done. If we had stayed more than one night would definitely have asked for another room, it's possible that we were just unlucky with this stay. Other things to note: the room was incredibly small, and the view out our window was of a concrete building approx 1 yard away. Lighting is kept very very low, and there's no in-room coffee. If youre ok with small spaces, though, and are either a very sound sleeper or can get a room without the central air noise issue, the hotel is in a pretty good location and the rooms are tastefully designed.

The roof top wasn't open due to construction but we still enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and quiet but on the small side. I guess that's normal for NYC hotels. The bathroom was clean and a good size. There were two robes and hair dryer in our room. The mini bar was stocked but I think it's better to pick up snacks from near by places. Overall a wonder stay.

The rooms are comfortable but not cushy or busy. 6 is at the epicenter of our regular pastimes in The Apple: the Metropolitan Opera, theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, walking in the Park, museums,Frankie and Johnnie's Steakhouse at 45th and 8th., and Bar Boulud and P.J. Clarke's in Lincoln Square. The neighborhood has excellent coffee and hot chocolate meccas as close as a stone's throw. We walk to everything except East Side and downtown museums restaurants and friends. For these there is the subway and cabs are plentiful. Except when they aren't, of course, at which point an enthusiastic young door person races out and snags one promptly every time and assists. JALC, Bouchon pastries, and a magnificent cavernous Whole Foods are across the street, as is a convenient subway junction. Next door is a comfy neighborhood New York bar and grill, The Coliseum, which has WiFi, surprisingly good food, and a convivial bar.  We'll be back next February for, you guessed it, operas, plays, a jazz concert, and also the terrier trials at the Westminster Dog Show down on a midtown Hudson pier... The hotel bar is intimate but at times noisy and/or dominated by the ebullience of young high flyers and/or high flyers manqués. On the other hand the rooftop bar, ""this small rooftop lounge gets you just far enough out of the city to appreciate it once again."" notes New York Magazine is a gem. Overall: Nice job 6!

We didn't get the room/view we expected for the parade so I cancelled the rest of our stay and booked the remainder of our trip at the nearby 6 Columbus with less than 12 hours notice and little scrutiny. Based on how much money we saved I'd give it 5 stars just for that. Pros: the sushi place, which doubles as breakfast as well for those who choose breakfast option, was good. The hotel service was quick (more towels & ice). In and out access with ease. Cons - the rooms are small (although we had the middle of the road size), view was to a weird interior space and either the A/C was broken or it was just a fan mode...not sure, but it got stuffy so we opened a window. The whole place is dim but that seems common for boutique NYC.

The washroom however was designed by a man. The mirror was too high, the water splashed out of the sink every time you turned the tap on, the bathtub was a very high step up and in, but the rod the shower curtain hung on was too low causing the shower curtain the lie on the bottom of the tub. They also installed a glass shelf in the wall of the shower head causing the water to splash off of it and out of the shower. We got a good deal on the rate, but would not want to pay full price.

Small, cramped spaces with tacky design that uses an overdose of black and dark accents, are passed of as 'hip' and come with a hefty price tag. The standard rooms are tiny, the window sill is used as a part of the minibar, the corridors are small and smell strangely of stale food, the grey walls, low lighting in the room with dark curtains make the room morose and dull. The bathrooms, in black tile with low light don't give the impression of being clean. On the plus side, the location is fantastic. Right in front of Columbus Circle Stn. So getting anywhere in Manhattan is easy. It's literally at the corner of Central Park so a pleasant walk through the park - to The Met, if you want.

I had made a mistake and making my reservation, and showed up a day early. These guys could easily have shown me the door and told me to come back tomorrow. But they went out of their way to accommodate me. They went above and beyond the call of duty to help me as I arrived at roughly 3 AM. I had an extremely difficult trip, and these men could see it in my eyes. They took care of me, and made my arrival experience wonderful. Without these two men, and the hospitality they afforded me, it could've been disaster. It's employees like these that guarantee customers will come back for repeat business.  This hotel is located directly across the street from the A,C,1, B, D subway trains. That me if you can get anywhere in New York City by walking across the street in jumping into the subway. You cannot beat this location. It's across the street from the Time Warner Center, which has a Whole Foods in its basement. It's a 45 second walk to Central Park, where horse and carriage rides or bicycle rentals await you.  The rooms are clean, and the custodian in that cleaned our room was a wonderful woman. The doormen are extremely friendly and helpful as well, even at 3 AM.  If I return to New York City, and I plan to do so, I can't imagine staying anywhere else. I've stayed here before, and they continue to earn my repeat business.  And don't forget the wonderful sushi restaurant located downstairs in this very hotel. It's called blue ribbon sushi, and it is absolutely stupendous. I can't get this hotel a better review. If I have one recommendation, it would be to put micro refrigerators and microwaves in each of the rooms. And I guess one more suggestion, I would put a curved shower rod in the bathrooms as the showers are quite small, and the curtains blow in and take up half of the shower space. A curved rod would eliminate this problem.  Thank you for a great stay, and please recognize Matthew and Brandon.

Toilet paper holder is positioned directly outside the shower so if you didn't hold the shower curtain shut, the toilet paper got soaked. Heating system was antiquated, it took several tries to get the appropriate temperature for a 70 degree spring day. The bathroom had heated floors, which honestly was the only true amenity in the room. I requested a room away from the elevator and was assigned a room directly adjacent to the elevator. The final straw was calling for my car, after being assessed the valet parking charge, being told 5 to 10 minutes, and having to wait almost an hour.

Also, it popped up at a good price on the Hotel Tonight app, influencing my choice.First, just a clarification. The hotel is not on Columbus Circle. Rather, it's at 58th and 8th. That was a little confusing and it took me some time to find it. Because I booked through Hotel Tonight, I was given a ""pod"" room, which was quite small. There was room for a full-sized bed, two narrow end tables, and a small desk with a TV over it. That said, it was fine for one, or even two if you're not planning on spending much time in the room. Perhaps their other rooms are larger.The bathroom was really nice and featured a lovely stall shower with a showerhead that offered lots of water pressure. Yay! Everything was very clean and smelled fresh.I have two small complaints: For some reason, there was no top sheet on the bed. The only cover was a comforter. I checked a few times to see if perhaps I was sleeping on top of the top sheet, but that wasn't the case. So, when it got hot overnight and I wanted to remove the comforter, I had nothing thinner to cover me. Also, every time the air conditioner fan would come on, it would click two times first. Then it would do the same when it was ready to turn off. That became quite annoying through the night. Extra kudos to the front desk staff and the bell hops for being very nice. They were talkative and friendly and always smiling. Nice!",Pennsylvania,"pat221</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",46,4.0

It was not subtle that they might be professionals of the evening perhaps, so I really did not want to create a cat fight at 4am, so I did not get out of bed to call security.

Our room had a very comfortable bed, mini bar good TV, plus a street view but I think some rooms haven't been updated so be sure to ask when you check-in. We found all the staff friendly and quick to respond to requests. One note is that the heating/air conditioning, while efficient, isn't all that quiet, although it is built in, not one of those aw afoul window boxes.

It's a no-go. I stay in NYC quite a bit and I can honestly say it's the 1st time I have had to pay to get WIFI on my phone, in my room. UGH. When I pick up my latte from Starbucks next door, I'm soooo posting this. I am not a scathing review kind of person. I generally have a great experience just about anywhere I visit...unless it's rotten. Ok, it wasn't ROTTEN but is IS 24 hours of my life and $200 clams that I can never get back. We had tickets to The Met and this location is great. Although note, midtown pretty much closes up shop post-theatre. We chose this hotel because of it's proximity to Lincoln Center. Usually, we bank up at the Soho Grand and it's a palace compared to this place. The only reason I make reference to the SG is that the room rates are similar when not booked on discount.We booked through the Hotel Tonight app and clearly that is not cool. Check in welcome was both condescending and rude from the male and female staff at the desk. The bartender at Blue Ribbon Sushi was also rude when we ordered a cocktail ($24 for two drinks btw). She was clearly behind on side work. But I believe ""rude"" behavior is probably a requirement to work here. This Beaux-Arts style building boasted smaller than average hotel rooms for NYC. After the front desk clerk unsuccessfully tried to put me and my wife in a room with double beds, we were ""upgraded"" to a queen superior with a city view: rubbish under a tarp, building wall, and a view into someone's apt. I think it was my tweet that landed the upgrade. Decor is somewhat contemporary but falls short of hip. Black and white laminate, cobalt drapes and a pair of Z. Cavaricci jeans in the wardrobe. Opened in 2007, and touted as ""futuristic"", this black hole is showing signs of age.Pros: We DID NOT have working heat. How is that a ""pro"", you ask? After an hour of cold air blowing of us (NYC temps were in the single digits that night), we called the desk. A tech was promptly sent up and provided remedy within minutes. YAY!Cons: It was 2:30am and they didn't offer a late checkout. BOO.The old adage: You get what you pay for, don't stick here.

The service was great. The staff at the front desk to the doormen were all helpful and very friendly. The restaurant is blue ribbon sushi and its great. The bar on the roof top is also pretty cool even though not many people were up there. Ok, so we first had got a POD room which is a room with a full size bed. I'm 6'3 and did not want to crush my girlfriend so we upgraded for $50 to a king size bed with a ""view"". We were on the 9th floor and our view was an office inside the time warner building. The room was very bland and beginning to look a little outdated. The floors must have been treated because they were so slippery that we kept on falling and slipping in the room. The bathroom was very small and the shower was average to say the least. Needed a water late at night and all they had was an $8 bottle of Evian in the room. I think a complimentary water would have been a good touch rather a rip off of a water. The bed was very low to the ground and semi comfortable. Practically little to no space to manoeuvre around in the room. Overall the hotel was Average and that's why I rated it 3 stars.

But there were some little things that just shouldn't happen at a hotel stay that are preventing me from doing that.I'll start with the positives.1) Location. This is really in a great area! So close to Central Park, Broadway, Times Square, etc. Really in the center of it all. 2) Decor and atmosphere. Very modern, very clean, very posh. The rooms are cozy - don't expect anything large. With the king bed, a chair, me and my suitcase - it was a full house.3) Staff. Employees were great, friendly and helpful.And now to the negatives...1) The room keys only work some of the time. My business colleague and I were down at the front desk about once a day to get our keys reprogrammed. 2) It's FREEZING! I had the heat in my room cranked up the whole time just to be comfortable at night. I slept bundled up in a robe b/c there weren't extra blankets that I could find in the room. I heard other guests complaining about this too.3) The shower didn't work or drain properly. My day there I couldn't get the shower to turn on. A maintenance man had to come up and use some elbow grease to get it to turn. But then it wouldn't drain. I stood in water up to my calves every time I took a shower. My colleague had a similar problem.Again, I really want to give this hotel a higher rating.

Never been happier to check out of a hotel...and we have stayed at others in NYC over the years as well as hotels in Europe, Asia and the Pacific Rim. We do not expect or seek opulence for which we do not pay for, but we do expect to receive the value promised or portrayed. We have experienced better stays in NYC for a quarter of the cost. Maybe it's just me, but I do not think convenience is defined by being close to a coffee shop to run out to for morning coffee as opposed to in-room coffee makers of any style. But then, considering this hotels many failings, in-room coffee does seem a little petty.","Muskego, Wisconsin, United States","Jeff S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Muskego, Wisconsin, United States</strong>",3,1.0

We stayed in superior king room for 3 nights and let me tell you - these were 3 nights more than we needed to. This hotel has 2 good things about it - location and the bed. Everything else is not what they sell to you. 1. The room is so small you cannot put a chair against the table to work or do anything. 2. Everything is old, carpets are worn and dirty, light fixture was torn. 3. No natural light comes into the room. 4. the thermostat is probably 40 years old. 5. You can hear any noise in the next room as if you are literally there. When someone opens a tap in the shower you feel like you are standing there, this is how loud it is.Overall for 300 bucks a night I would not recommend it to anyone, there are plenty hotels in NYC that are really renovated and nice to spend time in when you need to.

The price was good (for New York), but there were some housekeeping issues. The first room I was given had dried urine on the toilet seat, and the sheet on the bed had a small hole in it. I went downstairs and asked for a new room. The second room I was given had a used bandage on the floor by the bed, and the toilet ran after being flushed. I had to change rooms a third time before receiving a room that was clean. All this changing of rooms took some time, and I had arrived fairly late in the evening, so by the time I actually got to bed it was pretty late and I was quite frustrated.The upside, and why I have given this hotel a 2 and not a 1, is that the hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating both times I asked to changed rooms. And they were apologetic about the condition of the first two rooms I was given. That made the situation easier to deal with, but overall I was quite unhappy and frustrated.

I have conflicting feelings about this hotel. As a travel critic, I am very fair but strict and feel everyone deserves a second chance but I look at check-in to be the beginning and most important impression. This can make or break your stay. Adriana, front desk helped with a reservation and was fantastic. I cannot say enough about her she is warm, welcoming and just a perfect. Flo is also accommodating and very nice. Unfortunately, on the day of check in, I missed Adriana and Felicia checked me in. Upon entering the hotel, Felicia was cold, unwelcoming and just not interested in accommodating me with any needs or questions, it seemed I was bothering her. I really felt like I should turn around and walk out, again first impressions are the most important. Flo was there but busy, however she smiled and seemed warm, so because of her I decided to stay. Our room key had difficulty with, it worked after several tries each time.I had a Deluxe Queen room, it was nice and clean. Lots of space. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice too. Love the shower, strong and nice bathtub too. Windows did not open but still nice, no real view. There was a mini bar that was very costly but nice variety. A bit noisy in the early mornings with workers. A very cute rooftop lounge, very small, but comfortable for a little out of room get away. As for my tests that I give to see how accommodating for my needs, like extra towels or pillows, they are slow, but ok. Front door staff and bellmen very nice! But understand that because of my first impression at check in I still have a bad taste in my mouth. In all honestly I do not feel that the rooms are worth more then the high 300 to 400 range I did find a special and paid under 300 and felt that was perfect. Maybe a little bit higher in price I would've went but again in all honesty did not find this to be a luxury hotel or boutique style luxury hotel like they indicate. But after all, this is New York City and we are right by Columbus Circle. I did meet with the sales manager and did advise her of my situation upon check-in and my feelings. Hopefully things will be better next time around since I always like to give second chances.I know the sales manager was shocked when I told her what I felt and maybe insulted but I had to be totally honest. I also did find that there is only one wastepaper basket in the room and I felt that was inconvenient.Bottom line, would I stay again maybe down the road for a really good price and hopefully I can reevaluate. Please note that they do not offer a business center only a very small laptop at front of desk to use.

From the windows of the hotel you can see one of the busiest subway stops in the world, but you won't hear a thing as people scramble every which way in hordes. The room was quiet, and the curtains solid enough to black out all the hubbub. You could enjoy a spacious and elegant room in peace for a while--even take a nap at evening rush hour. Then, when things quiet down, you could stroll out onto 59th street and be in easy walking distance of literally hundreds of restaurants, not to mention the theaters of Times Square and Lincoln Center, and the running paths of Central Park. Quiet, busy and completely safe neighborhood, even for the less than confident traveler. Or, for the more confident, hop on the 1 and go anywhere in Manhattan within 20 minutes. Then, retire to the bar in the Sushi restaurant downstairs to enjoy a nightcap, before going to sleep to start a day of exploring all over again! Staff is not only ostensibly personable, but actually recognize you and ask you friendly questions about your adventures, or offer gentle suggestions for fun to be had.

The decor is very dark and the rooms are dimly lit with no option of improving the lighting so it isn't everyone's taste. It is a very masculine decor but our room was fine or mostly fine except for plumbing issues.The problem we encountered was with one particular desk clerk who had absolutely no customer service skills. She was very attractive and I'm sure fits in nicely with the nightclub atmosphere so they may want to think of moving her to the bar area after they train her and coach her to smile a bit. We were charged an upgrade fee when I asked if they could give us two beds, or a queen with cot or a King. Most hotels in NYC try to accommodate and don't charge. Now it is annoying to be charged extra but we were myself, husband and daughter and we were given a room with a King bed. The room itself was ok but the toilet wasn't working properly and the sink wasn't draining. They should never put people in a room that isn't ready for guests. Upon reading further reviews I don't think the plumbing issue was the first of it's kind here. My husband spoke to the clerk and asked for another room but she ignored that and said she would send a maintenance guy up. My husband said well that is fine but we want another room, we were anxious to rest a bit after a long drive. The clerk sent the guy to fix the toilet, he was very nice and just went to work as we had to sit through the repairs. My husband called the desk again and asked for the room he had asked for, she was very rude and said she had nothing but a suite and she'd have to charge even more. My husband asked for a manager to call, 20 minutes later he called again to the desk and ended up getting some guy who said he was the manager ( we aren't sure if this was true) and he told him that he wasn't told he needed to call a guest. My husband expressed we weren't happy with this but were basically told that there was nothing they could do. He removed half of the charge from the upgrade fee but it was more about the lack of customer service and how much this annoyance took away from our experience. I notice that the manager seems to respond to the positive reviews only......this is never a good sign. Overall, the hotel was clean and most of the staff were nice, the bellhop, maintenance guy and other desk clerks were very friendly and more in keeping with what we have grown to expect from a nicer hotel in NYC. One more positive note, the shower was great....water pressure is wonderful.","Toronto, Canada","Karen_SB6344FF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",58,4.0

Only one chair was present, in the “hall” which was part of the room. The air conditioning was noisy, and it allowed the room temperature to fluctuate too much. The service people were very helpful, but it was not possible to get through to them by pushing the housekeeping or room service buttons on the phone.

I've stayed here several times for business and the main drawback in the rooms I've had is that they were all quite dark with views of machinery on top of nearby buildings or just walls of neighbouring buildings. I've stayed in a pod, a queen and an executive queen so perhaps if I'd stayed in a suite the views and light might have been better.The halls are also a bit dark and slightly rundown looking but the bedding is good quality and bright white and the bathrooms are very clean. New York is generally not for hanging out in the hotel room anyway. The hotel is just across the road from the Time Warner building that has a Whole Food downstairs and a great Bouchon Bakery on the top floor, where you can grab a coffee and look out over the southern edge of Central Park. It's steps away from Central Park and a 15 minute walk from things like the American Museum of Natural History or shops like the Bloomingdale flagship store.Like many hotels in NYC the prices go up and down considerably depending on the week but will definitely stay again for convenience. Not sure why it changed from being a Thompson Hotel to a Sixty Hotel. The front desk staff said it's still owned by the same company overall.

I stayed in one of the basic rooms on their 2nd floor and was quite disappointed with the experience.There are certain likeable features in the room such as the bathroom mirror lights, floor heater, and powerful air conditioning (which was perfect for a hot day in June). However, the carpet was dirty, the toilet broke down, and the design of the bathtub and shower curtain was hidicous causing flooding on the bathroom floor. While I loved how power the shower was, the water did not go down the pipe quick enough causing back flow of water accumulating in the tub. That was bad design.Also, there are handles on the bed-frame to open up drawers for storage; however, those handles had cut me a couple times while I was walking by or getting off the bed. I personally thought that was also a bad design.I suspect that the employees were underpaid and weren't well-trained since the messy janitor room/house-keeping storage units were left open, which indicates lack of care to customer experience.While the broken TV and toilet were fixed, the other complaints addressed to the the front desk at checkout weren't even apologized for - it didn't feel that the employee whom we checked out the room with cared about the issues at all.I do want to thank to bellman for allowing us to leave the suitcases with them for hours since my flight was late in the evening, hours after I checked out. They were courteous and professional.For a tourist, it may not be too bad of a choice if you just want to a convenient place to back to after a long day visiting New York; if you are expecting to stay in and relax, then the it's may not be the place for you unless you go for the upgrades.","Burnaby, Canada","178martink</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burnaby, Canada</strong>",17,3.0

The room was tiny, the carpet has seen better days and had stains all over it and dust was everywhere. We spent the day out and came back in the evening to find the floor of the 2nd floor completely covered in trash and a foul smell. The hotel lobby was very crowded because it hosts the entrance to the Japanese restaurant, which makes for some confusion as there's always people waiting for their table in the restaurant lobby (I've been to the restaurant many times on previous visits to nyc so this wasn't a surprise).Overall, the only nice thing about this place was the front desk, the valet service and a great Columbus circle location.

Firstly, this hotel is fine... but just fine. It appears as a 4 star hotel on booking sites, but I have stayed in many hotels and this is arguably nearer a 3 star hotel. I don't dispute they probably have more lavish rooms than their POD or Queen rooms, but ultimately this just means you get a 3 star room in a 4 star hotel if you select these rooms. Hotel lobby is exceptionally dark and I can't really understand the ambience that they are going for. It was easy to feel thoroughly depressed at the lack of natural light in the hotel so you would think that they would paint the walls a more neutral colour rather than black lobbies and dark blue walls in the corridors. Also, the room doors in this hotel seem to slam incessantly. You would think that in a 4 star hotel they would dampen the doors, but it was common to hear doors opening and shutting at the other end of the corridor during the nightFirst night we were placed in room 99, a pod room. It was a well appointed room and on first inspection was decent for the price paid (£100 per night on priceline). Given the price the room was acceptable, but would no way pay the rack rate that they advertise on their own website. My first impressions were quashed when the 10ftx10ft massive unit (air conditioner?) on the adjacent building kicked in and sounded like a jet engine stirring up every 30 minutes. Not exactly 4 star! We requested a room change, but the hotel was full and this could not be honoured until the following day. We were moved as promised the very next day.Nonetheless, hotel staff were polite and helpful. Location of this hotel is excellent and well situated for the subway and other midtown Manhattan hotspots. If you can get a good deal on this hotel it worth a look. But frankly, I could have had a deal for only £15 more a night at the Hyatt with a city view and I would probably go for that next time as a safe hotel bet.Not a bad hotel all-in-all, but only if you can get at a low price. Otherwise, there are better to be had in NYC.","Cardiff, United Kingdom","npatterson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",16,3.0

I'm not sure that giving away a reserved room to someone else on the fly is accepted practice, but it didn't seem right. Got upgraded for the remainder of the stay to compensate - very good corner suite - but disingenuous first impression already left. Also got charged for mini-bar purchases which didn't happen, no response at all to multiple emails to the hotel and only refunded when email sent to the chief exec of the company (not a massive issue, more the principle of it).

I love staying in proximity of Columbus Circle, because it is so convenient to Central Park, shopping on 5th, and dining/entertainment on the western half of the city (HK, Chelsea, SOHO). It is a very convenient location. This was my first time staying at 6 Columbus. I was impressed. I only stayed one night, so I was not able to use all of the amenities of the hotel. Coffee shops, drug stores, liquor stores, are all within a one block walk. Vibe: This hotel has a great look. I would not considerate it luxurious, but it is hip and efficient. It is small, and in the perfect location. The location of the hotel makes it. This is NOT a family-oriented hotel.Service: I walked into the hotel in the morning from a terrible flight into LGA. The front desk upgraded my room, and found me an available room for immediate check in. When I called for ice, I received a knock on my door within 5-minutes. The front desk/concierge team knows the area well, and is very helpful with recommendations. Security is excellent, and polite - there are not 200 partiers making a scene trying to get to the bar. The entire staff was wonderful.Room: Small, modern, and efficient - think a large cruise ship room. The room was larger than other hotels in the neighborhood. I was in a Queen. Fantastic selection of in-room snacks/drinks. Wonderful bedding, bath products, and bath hardware. The shower was amazing. Heat and water were perfect (January stay). No view, but I was not concerned with that. The hotel has a roof-top deck/bar. Immaculately clean room. High style.Common areas: The hotel is showing a bit of age, but it is not disconcerting. Elevators were fast, which is rare in this neighborhood. Some wall paper is tattered, grout dirty, paint scraped, etc. Most travelers would not notice it. Summary: I enjoyed staying at 6 Columbus, and look forward to staying here again. I would book this hotel for a one or two night stay, but not if I had a full week of meetings. The staff is superb and the rooms are in great condition. Many modern hotels in NY have been ""Rock Starred Out."" My room was not, and in perfect condition. I enjoyed my stay.

It's right opposite the Time Warner Building and there is also a Starbucks and supermarket right next to the hotel so it's good for someone like me who cannot be bothered to go out to eat sometimes after a long day of work. 6 Columbus used to be a hip and stylish boutique hotel but I guess after so many years since it's opened, it's kind of worn down and it's not that cool anymore compared to a lot of other boutique hotels in town. Their rooms smell sometimes and they are very small for its price (then again, it's New York). They use branded amenities which is nice and one would feel being pampered. Unfortunately, their housekeeping seems to have their own cleaning and restocking system - one day your amenities or mini bar get refilled, one day it doesn't. I tried to explain these situations to the receptionist a few times in separate occasions but since it had not helped so far so I just couldn't be bothered anymore especially after a day of tiring work. However, it also means that I'll have to spend extra time to check my bills every time I check out.The receptionist are not particularly helpful or informative either, but must say they are presentable appearance wise. One thing I must give to this hotel is that their bellboys are very friendly and helpful. Since I usually travel with big suitcases and have to meet different customers from one location to another, the bell boys have been super friendly and helpful fetching me cabs (it can be very difficult at peak hours), carrying my suitcases etc. I really think they deserve a raise coz honestly if not because of their service, I would have requested my company to change to another hotel for me long time ago!O, their bar can get quite noisy on a Friday night and weekend!

We were each upgraded for free to higher floors, which are bigger rooms, which was amazing as we were first timers to this hotel and to the Thompson hotels group. She was upgraded to the 11th floor (floor 11 has only four rooms) which had a large bedroom with a closet and desk and the most comfortable bed she had ever had in a hotel, and my mom has travelled all over the world. There was also a lovely big marble bathroom. Room was modern style but comfortable and roomy, and there were windows on both sides of the bedroom and one in the bathroom--it was on the back of the hotel and was super quiet. My room was the 12th floor two story Columbus Loft, which has an open plan kitchen/living room with a full marble bath off the kitchen, with a remote operated gas fireplace with a 60-inch flatscreen over it! the living room portion is double height, and there are private stairs up to the king bedroom and gigantic marble clad bathroom, with a steam shower big enough for even the most confirmed claustrophobic (with a window so you can watch the sky while you shower), a huge separate soaking tub, double sinks and the toilet in a separate windowed area inside the bathroom. The king bed was incredibly comfortable with high end linens and a flat screen perfectly positioned for viewing from the bed. The entire suite had floor to ceiling windows which were sparkling clean so as to be able to enjoy the views of Columbus Circle, the sky, and a peek of Central Park and the East Side beyond. For those who like a dark room to sleep, the room has been smartly appointed with easy to operate privacy screen shades and blackout curtains. There were three easily accessible and available outlets under the desk and there were several in the bathrooms and there may have been more, I did not bother looking. There are two Juliet balconies off the living room, too. As for service, I was incredibly Impressed with everyone I encountered. Three different bellmen helped us over the course of our stay, with luggage, directions, taxis, etc-- even going that extra bit to run us down one a block away and holding it there for us. The front desk was great with directions and quick checkins and checkouts--I saw them helping a traveler with his difficult checkin for a foreign flight first on a computer then making a series of phone calls to get the job done. We did not eat dinner in the sushi restaurant but we had drinks there Saturday night after the opera and the bartenders handled the hip (and hungry, dinner til 2 am) crowd with charm and aplomb. We were there Sunday morning for the delicious and very well priced breakfast. My only complaints were that the bottled water in the room was all part of the mini bar program, I feel in NYC a small complimentary bottle on the nightstand is a nice touch. On the other hand, there is a Duane Reade (a division of Walgreens) operating 24/7 just outside the front door, so this is a problem easily sorted out. In short, we had a terrific stay in a very clean hotel, we had amazing service and I highly recommend 6 Columbus.",,Laura M,7,5.0

The four of us had dinner at the sushi restaurant downstairs and it was great -- though noisy. Our room was clean and comfortable and we found the entire staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful at all times. My only issue with the King Suite is that it provides no storage. There is a very, very small free-standing wardrobe that barely fits in the tiny bedroom (you can't even open the wardrobe door without closing the bedroom door) and other than that there is essentially zero storage. We had four people and NOT ONE drawer (except for the tiny drawers of the bedside tables in the bedroom, which would accommodate a couple of hairbrushes). The ""living"" area of the Suite is, unlike the bedroom, quite roomy, and could EASILY accommodate a chest of drawers on either side of the fold-out sofa, or even another, larger wardrobe. The bathroom is also very small for a King Suite -- just one very, very small sink, and again -- no storage. Not a drawer, not a shelf, nothing. So the stuff of four people ends up on the countertop. With our two kids having to live entirely out of suitcases and my husband and I unable to put most of our stuff away, the drawback of the room was that we were constantly walking over each other's stuff.

Sadly it appears to be yet another one of those pretentious, trendy looking but completely unpractical hotel. I was in a Superior King room which is a mid to high grade room of this hotel. The room is small - which is fine - I've stayed in plenty of small hotel rooms in NYC and Tokyo as long as the design is smart and use the space effectively. Unfortunately, the design here is completely flawed. There was only one chair in the room and when pulled up to the desk, one cannot get through the room from one side to the other because it backs right up to the foot of the bed. There was no desk lamp and the lighting overall was so bad that it will make working at night impossible. I went on the website and looked at some pictures and noticed most rooms have desk lamp, so I called for one. They delivered a desk lamp that was so huge that it wouldn't fit on the already very small desk! The bathroom was very spacious but then again the design was flawed. The tub was so narrow and instead of having a curved shower rod which most hotels have these days to enlarge the shower space, it comes with a straight one right over the edge of the tub, making it simply claustrophobic to take a shower plus there is no way to NOT touch the curtain or the wall. The mirror over the sink was so high that I could barely see my chin, making it also impossible to see and blow dry my shoulder length hair. I'm short - 5'3"" - but THAT short. When I returned from dinner, the room smelled like smoke - apparently through the AC vent as someone must be smoking somewhere in the hotel. When I went to set my alarm, I found out that the clock was completely broken - no wonder the time on it was wrong! It was just one thing after another that made by typical,supposedly business-as-usual stay uncomfortable and unpleasant. The Thompsons Hotels website looks so intriguing that I was looking forward to this stay and was hoping that I would find a new, boutique hotel chain to love. But sadly this falls far below my expectations.","Boston, Massachusetts","GotLobster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",46,2.0

I reserved a King Deluxe room about a week before arrival and used the 10% off deal the hotel offered through TripAdvisor. I arrived a little early (1:30pm) and my room (#31) wasn't ready so I stored my bags and walked around midtown for a few hours. When I got back, the bellman brought my bag up and asked if I needed a luggage rack (I said no, but in retrospect I should've said yes). I ended up just putting my bag on the desk which was fine. I thought there was plenty of room to maneuver around the bed and never felt cramped. One of my favorite parts was the little sitting area (a couple chairs and table) by the window which looked out onto 58th street (across from the TW Center) - a perfect perch for people watching. The bathroom was fine as well, sized well for the room. The only nitpick was that the sink was oriented 90 degrees to the left, so that kind of threw me the first few times. Seriously, not a huge deal but I remembered it. I didn't have a water problem like other reviewers but it is a low ledge getting into the shower so if you don't have the curtain the right way, I could see where there would be problems. The bed itself was firm, the chairs were comfy and there was never really much noise coming from either the hallway or the street - a couple times I heard sirens & trash trucks, but I wouldn't really call that ""street noise"" and I was just on the 3rd floor.I look at NYC like I look at Vegas - if you're spending very much time in your room, you're doing it wrong. For 6 Columbus, the selling point has to be location and what I would call ""location-based amenities"". First off, there's a Duane Reed (24-hr drugstore), a Starbucks, a Subway & a Dunkin' Donuts within 100 feet of the front door. The subway is directly across the street and the Columbus Circle stop seemed to have all the major trains. I didn't partake in the Blue Ribbon Sushi in the hotel but the reviews made it out to be one of the best in the city - the heat wave just didn't give me an appetite for sushi. I did try out the rooftop bar, Above 6 Columbus and it was fine - moderately priced drinks (glass of Macallan 12 for $16) and there were indoor and outdoor seating areas. Even with the heat, the outdoor area was nice and provided a view of the Circle. All the administrative bits of the hotel, check in and out, staff responsiveness, housecleaning and overall service were all above par with my other travels, so no complaints there. When I come back to NYC I will for sure greatly consider 6 Columbus for my stay and I say that just because who knows I may want to stay in a different part of town. For the Central Park area, the combination of value and accommodations were perfect for me this week.","Monrovia, California","bigjohn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monrovia, California</strong>",1,4.0

This hotel is located at Columbus Circle and was relatively close to the church and conveniently close to the reception venue. I reserved a King Deluxe room about three weeks before my arrival. Upon my arrival (about 2pm), I was told the room wasn't ready as the room carpet was being shampooed. Checked in again later after 4pm and then again about 5:30pm and the room still was not ready. Finally, at 6:15pm I was given the key to the room. One of the bell men, Chris, helped bring the luggage up with us. We entered the room and immediately smelled an unnatural scent. In short, it was nasty (like vomit or urine). I went back to the front desk and spoke with the staff. They asked no questions and looked for another room. It took some time but they located another room. Unfortunately, there were no other king deluxe rooms so I was put into a queen deluxe. The room faced an interior area unlike the king deluxe which faced street. It was a little disappointing however still comfortable. But, the manager, Mark, made a concession the next day and was sincerely apologetic for the problem. Our stay coincided at the beginning of the HEATWAVE and the hotel AC worked perfectly. Throughout our entire stay, ALL of the staff were genuinely friendly.. When the concierge forgot to save me a Sunday NY Times newspaper (having my cousin's wedding notice), one of the bell men, Lawrence, set out and obtained one for me that evening.

We had a good view out towards Columbus Circle, but never heard any noise through the night. We used the hotel bar a few times, and although a little expensive, the staff were very friendly. We didn't eat in the restaurant so I cannot comment on this, but it did look to be very busy. The rooftop bar is an added bonus and is a nice way to spend a sunny evening. The only downside is the lack of fitness centre, although I can't say that we missed it that much! The location really is one of the best parts of this hotel - straight across from the subway station and easy walking to Central Park, 5th Avenue and Times Square. Throughout the week, we were left notes and gifts from the manager which was a nice touch too. From the housekeeping to the front desk staff, we were always greeted with a smile and a friendly chat. We can't wait to return to this hotel - we enjoyed every minute of it!","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Suzanne M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

The hotel was what I had expected from the Thompson group. Modern decor and friendly staff. They were very nice to upgrade us from a Deluxe Queen to a Studio King for $75 and it was worth it!. The rooms in the deluxe queen or king are very very small. Good for 1 person but not 2. The studio king had a terrace and a sliver view of the park. Given that I'm familiar with NYC- I didn't feel the need to spend $880+ for a 5 star hotel.

The wardrobe wouldn't be big enough for a longer stay, and I'd recommend if you're staying longer than we did that you get a bigger room or stay somewhere else.The location is what this hotel is best for - right opposite the subway, the shops at the Time Warner Centre were great and I'd really recommend Landmarc, a restaurant on the 3rd floor - we went just after we arrived after a recommendation from a girl on the front desk. It was packed when we got there, but we were served super quickly and the food was great. Right next to Central Park and not far from all the sights, the location was perfect for visiting all the sights.I think it's kinda outrageous that they charge $15 a day for wifi when you can get free wifi next door at Starbucks and at most restaurants and places around the city.The guys on the door were really helpful, going the extra mile to get us a cab etc.Overall, mixed - but definitely check it out if you're only visiting for a short time and to see the major sites.","London, United Kingdom","Emily C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,4.0

Internet connection was $15/day - and we were unable to use our cellphones to call locally unless we had paid the $15. There is no business centre to use a common wifi nor an excercise room ($45/day across the street). The upside of this hotel for us was that the staff were wonderful - friendly, helpful, efficient and knowledgeable.

The location is easy - suway across the street, Central Park a block away, MoMa 5 blocks....easy to get around. There is a Whole Foods in the mall across the street, so we could enjoy the veggie bar and hot foods buffet if we didn't feel like going out for a meal.

The bad: This hotel charges $15 per day for wi-fi in 2013! On top of that, they indicate the $15 is for 24 hours, but don't really mean that. We checked in around 8:00 p.m. on Friday evening and checked out on Sunday and were informed by a borderline hostile front desk person that we were responsible for 3 days because that's ""how they calculate it"". We had to switch rooms during our stay because the air conditioning didn't work in our room (taking a chunk out of our day to pack and move, not to mention the time we spent in a hot room before that) and suggested maybe they could comp the wi-fi as compensation for that inconvenience, but no deal. It was a little embarrassing.

We stayed 3 nights. There are a few things we enjoyed about this hotel, that are important to us, as travelers. First and foremost, the staff was very friendly and accomodating. We especially want to recognize Peter who was so attentive to our every need, always happy to help in any way he could and always inquiring as to what more he or the staff could do for us. Anything we needed, or any issue we had (1 minor, i.e. slow drain in bathroom) was taken care of promptly. We had a room with a king-size bed which was a little larger (not by much though) than the queen size the in-laws had. Many of the reviews here have comments about the size of the rooms...yes they are small and not much room for scooting by one another but we were out from early morning to late evening. If you are looking for a hotel room in which you want to 'hang out', then this is not it. If you want a nice, cozy, upscale room to come back to after a busy day then it's perfect. Tip: We asked for 2 of those little folding luggage racks to place our suticases on, as they were not items already in the room. This was more convenient than accessing the suitcases from the floor. Iron and Ironing board are also not in the room, but all you have to do is ask for them. everything was promptly delivered by housekeeping. This hotel gave us the feeling that we had our own private residence. Once we were in our room you didn't hear a thing. Yes the rooms could have better lighting, but again, it was very relaxing to come to at the end of the day. We never once heard a siren from the streets of New York...we slept great! The only reason I'm not able to give the hotel an 'excellent' rating is because of the experience we had at the rooftop bar, as well as the first floor bar and sushi restaurant. Although they may be seperately owned businesses within the hotel (we weren't sure) they are still part of the hotel 'experience' overall and we might have spent more time at each if the staff had not been as aloof and indifferent as they were. Much different attitudes than the front desk and concierge staff at the hotel.We would definitley stay here again, however.","Orlando, Florida","Gabby N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",1,4.0

I've been in plenty of Manhattan hotels and this is one of my favorites. I think it comes down to the smaller scale of the place. Because it doesn't have hundreds of rooms the vibe is cool. The guest doesn't encounter mobs of people there and because the staff doesn't either, service is top notch.The location is good--a subway stop across the street at the Time Warner Center(with shops aplenty), Starbucks right next door for beanheads, and Central Park a hop, skip and jump away.The rooms are comfortably chic, with New York minimalist style and form following function. Spacious, they are not, but pleasing nonetheless. They are decently sized by local standards.I had dinner in the hotel's Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill on an earlier visit and found that the meal was the winner that the name suggests.

The Blue Ribbon off the lobby is a great place, and seems less overrun than the downtown locations. The terrace off the Studio Suite I stayed in was a very nice bonus. The tub was large, as was the bathroom itself. Everything was clean. Bed and pillows were comfy. I think I would have been perfectly happy with this place if it didn't tout itself as a luxury hotel with unparalleled service. I have stayed at places like that and the property just didn't live up to those expectations. The Studio Suite was large, but neither a suite nor a studio. You could call the decor ""minimalist,"" I guess, but it just felt sparse, not stylish. The 350-ish-sf room had a king-size bed, closet, TV console/desk, a tiny short side table with 2 chairs...and a ton of unused floor and wall space. There's definitely room for a small loveseat (like you might expect in a suite/studio) or even a single comfortable chair/ottoman setup...there was plenty of seating on the terrace, though! Missing: adequate lighting (I hate harsh lighting, but even by my standards this was very dim, and the bathroom lighting via the round mirror is weird and unflattering. I also couldn't find any lighting for the terrace, which made it difficult to enjoy it at night.), a mirror in the room (only mirror is the round one over the sink the bathroom), a rug (hardwood is nice, but cold on the feet and also noisy), nice shower fixtures (tub stopper was broken, shower felt like stabby needles being shot at my back and was not adjustable), coffee/hot water maker, iron/steamer. I had trouble getting the room to a comfortable temperature -- only heat was available, no cooling -- but maybe it was too early in the season to turn on the HVAC, or maybe I'm just inept! The room doors slam, and do not block smells, sounds, or light. At night, the hallway lights shine through the gaps. I could hear everything going on in the hallway and in other rooms at all hours - I know this is a hotel, but here there was hardly any difference between closing my door and leaving it wide open. My whole floor (and sometimes the lobby) stank of cigarette smoke, and because of the non-sealing doors, the room stank as well. Management was informed of the problem several times but they couldn't get the situation under control. Service was average. No turndown service, though I was there for two nights, and both times I was out of the room during the expected ""turndown time.""To sum up, this property is in a wonderful location. My stay would have been satisfactory had my expectations not been so high (which I don't think is unreasonable given the advertised prices and amenities). I'd recommend staying here if you get a good deal below their advertised rates.","Durham, North Carolina","BiscuitKnees</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, North Carolina</strong>",14,3.0

Was here on business and it was close to where we needed to be. It is not a bad hotel, it is just nothing special. There are much better hotels in Manhattan. The rooms are very small. I was actually upgraded, which i was appreciative of, but the room was still smaller than others i have stayed at in New York that were standard. I would actually give it 2 1/2 stars but that is not an option. The staff is efficient and polite and the beds were actually comfortable, although is it too much to ask for a sheet or blanket with the comforter? The location is the best. Right off Columbus Circle and near the subway stop.The actual fixtures in the room looked worn out. My ceiling light had a piece of the fabric hanging down that needed to be glued back up. The rooms are very small, so that also means the bathroom are very small. Mirros are rather high up, and not big. So if you are a woman or shorter man you are going to have to stretch to get a good view.And the noise. I just dont know why there has to be constant door slamming by the cleaning crew and the fellow patrons. If you are by the elevator i dont know how you would sleep. Their website advertises Kheils products, which are great, but they actually do not carry them any longer. When asked why their site said so, the front desk said ""We need to get that changed on the webiste, it has been a long time since we stopped"". Uh ok. Elevators took forever. Just use the stairs. Bottom line if you dont care about sleeping late and just need to crash for a night or two, then this should do the trick. If you are there a prolonged period of time and in room often, dont bother. Much better hotels. Tip: Ask for a room away from elevators. My co-workers had rooms next to and said it was just awful. I had one away but with the door slamming it was not much better on the morning i could sleep in.","Dallas, Texas","DallasJD6189</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",24,3.0

The bathroom is adequate and I even managed to have a bath which sometimes in a NYC shoebox is impossible. Due to Hurricane Sandy the bar that faces Columbus Circle and Central Park was closed, which was a little disappointing as that would have been a nice experience. We went over to the Mandarin Oriental over the street for a great high rise cocktail. Very Nice.One odd thing was that on our floor just as you got out of the elavator, it stank of strong cheese or worse some sort of acidic sick concoction.

The pro's: staff was friendly and attentive, nice clean rooms is a good location. The con's: as is typical in NYC, the rooms can be a bit on the small side. The design is a bit dated, almost retro, but not quite. The first room I had didn't have a desk in it (a hotel room without a desk? even budget hotels have desks) so that was disappointing, they did however move me into a room that had a desk once it became available. In summary, this is a decent hotel and I'd have no problem staying here again.

We stayed here while in town for the birthday of a friend and chose this hotel because the dinner party held was across the street. We reserved a queen superior room for a very good rate $175, but even for New York it was TINY! Can I emphasize tiny. I can't imagine how anyone could manage in the even smaller pod room. However it was not the small room size that was per se horrible. The room completely reaked of cigarette smoke (to the point I was having asthma like symptoms), dark, dingy, and the only window that opened was to the inside vent shaft which was full of pigeon sh** and looked directly into the room of a naked, oversized man doing horrible things to himself. I am traumatized...but I digress.My husband called down and begged for us to be afforded another room. Management refused. We tolerated this room for a bit, but after another hour of us not being able to walk to the bathroom or the closet without stepping on each other, and my having an asthma attack from the smoke, my husband went down to check us out. At this point the manager offered us a Suite on the third floor which overlooked Columbus, the Galleria and voila, my memory of the creepy oversized naked man and pigeon doo doo wafted away into the air like New York sewer steam. God I love New York....But again, I digress...the suite was bright, airy, spacious, which a comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom, separate living room and although noisy being on the third floor and overlooking Columbus...was terrific. So - unless you book a room with a window that actually opens to fresh air or a room large enough for you and your partner...look elsewhere.","Toronto, Canada","emadanda</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",115,2.0

The Trump Tower and the Mandarin are out of my budget, and the Empire is simply a dive. I stumbled upon 6 Columbus via Priceline. I was skeptical, but needed a place. Since it wasn't flagged on bedbugregistry.com, I decided to take a chance. What a find! I booked a ""pod"" (small) room for $190.Greeted upon arrival by the doorman who took my bags, ""announced"" me to the front desk who was all ready to check me in. This is a small hotel. Small but comfortable lobby, small elevators, and my room was small, but I knew it would be. There was no view, which wasn't important to me. But it was no smaller--and the view no worse--than any room I've ever booked at the Algonquin for more than twice that amount. And the bathroom at 6 Columbus was quite big, relative to the room and beautifully done in navy blue subway tile with a full sized tub, spacious sink, and deep return at the window, so there was plenty of room for everything. (And the water pressure was fabulous.) This set-up may be a little tight for two people, but for me it was just fine.The staff were always courteous and helpful, always making the extra effort. One note about the attached restaurant/bar. A group of us gave an order of cocktails to our waiter that included a vodka Gibson, a gin Gimlet, and a vodka martini. The waiter had never heard of any of those drinks, and they all came back mediocre. So, while staying at 6 Columbus, you may want to do your cocktail socializing elsewhere. Also, your cab driver may not have ever heard of this hotel, so be aware, ""6 Columbus Circle"" is actually to be found on 58th St. (right across from the 58th st. entrance to the Time Warner Center.)I would definitely stay here again.

The location : midtown, 5' walk from Central Park , 15' to the Rockefeller centre, a very nice mall in front of the hotel. The staff : helpful & friendly. The design : nice and contemporary. The terrace barNow, the negative aspects :. The rooms are very small, even by NYC standards, and are not any cheaper than the average!. The soundproofing is poor, as you can hear people walking in corridors, and above all, the noisy vents from outside. The breakfast is nothing to write home aboutFYI, there are ca. 10 rooms per floor. if you're aiming at single room, the serie ending in 9 overlooks a grim courtyard up to the 8th floor. On the 9th (room 99, which I was first assigned), the window faces a huge and noisy vent on a rooftop... I asked to change room and was assigned 74, which is on the other side of the building and has a relatively clearer view, although vents can still be heard.

We had to tuck a throw pillow at the bottom corner of the bed to keep from hitting the bed frame, which worked perfectly. The room was filled with trays of snacks, which we promptly consolidated and stored, and the minibar stocked with drinks - we prefer an empty frig for storage. Spacious, modern bathroom was a big plus, as well as nice bedding with down comforter and the in room safe.

Not much damage in that area and we were able to find restaurants there that were open on the Sunday and Monday. Staff were very friendly and accommodating-especially Carolina and Lawrence! Unfortunately they charge $15.00 per day for internet and if it weren't for the storm we could have just gone to Starbucks next door for a coffee and free internet. When our flight was cancelled on Tues we were able to extend until Thursday with no issue. I don't know about pricing because this was covered by the radio station. All items in the minibar were well overpriced, but there was a store on the corner where you could get almost anything you wanted. Buckets of ice were delivered upon request. The room was clean and comfortable, although a little small. Bathroom was functionally fine, but quite small. Beds were very comfortable, and we spent a lot of time sitting there, as during the storm we were told to stay in. At night we did, but not during the day.

They closed the Sushi restaurant during the storm, but did offer room service.

We found a nice coffee and crepes place about 2 blocks away on 8th ave, near W57th or 56th St.. It was really busy because they were the only place open-even McDonald's was closed.

It isn't super posh. It is, rather, dark and slick and perhaps in need of a little bit of primping. The location, however, is phenomenal and the atmosphere is great if its what you want. There's an aesthetic for every taste in Manhattan. Along the same lines, if you are coming to NYC for a view, make sure you ask for one (and be prepared to pay for it). Many of us go through life in the city staring at elevator shafts and brick walls. The staff was very courteous and helpful, despite it being an insane week in NY given the storm and, I'm sure, running short on sleep and support. My only critique is that I would suggest that management fixes the VERY squeaky bed in the Thompson Penthouse, and that they make sure that all the little amenities are there (I was short some bathroom products, etc.). However, they get a pass because I'm sure things were a little off kilter due to the circumstances.","New York, NYf","toonces47</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NYf</strong>",17,5.0

It offers a host of unique benefits:1. LocationCouldn't ask for anything more perfect. The hotel is right across the street from the Columbus Circle subway station (ABCD and 1 lines), caddy corner from Central Park and a quick walk to a majority of midtown landmarks. Absolutely perfect for any travelers, be they businessmen needing to get downtown to the financial district, couples heading to a Broadway show, or a solo traveler looking to cover everything and anything.2. Comfort/Lack of NoiseAlong with tasteful, bit not opulent, furnishings and very comfortable beds, the rooms in the back of the hotel isolate you from any city noise whatsoever. In my room (68), I couldn't hear a single horn or siren. The air conditioner was a bit loud but was powerful and gave a strong, solid cooling through the night. The bathroom is perfectly fine is NYC with a strong shower and good hot water consistency.3. ServiceThe staff at 6 Columbus was attentive, polite and aimed to please the guests. The front desk answered any questions and offered help, the doormen gladly hailed cabs and helped with your luggage, and the maintenance staff were extremely kind and outgoing when encountered in the hallways or elevator. The positive demeanor of the staff and efficient service made an already pleasant stay even more enjoyable.For the prices you can find on tablethotels.com for 6 Columbus, one would be a fool not to stay here. Sure, it's not the Waldorf=Astoria or the Ritz, but almost any traveler to NYC would be happy they stayed here. I will be sure to go back to them for my next trip to the best city in the world.","Evanston, Illinois","nustudent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Evanston, Illinois</strong>",4,5.0

I often stay overnight in the City and often at 6 Columbus. The reason? It's a great location, it has some nice staff members and the adjoining restaurant, Blue Ribbon Sushi is overpriced but has solid sushi--and is deservedly favour (oddly) for fried chicken. They have a good saki selection, creative cocktails and... did I mention the Marrow Fried Rice? Fantastic. Most important, the restaurant closes relatively late--around 2 am, so it is a good post-show option. The rooms are spartan (watch out for the corners of those beds!), with Frette-style comforters and a revived mod-style. The mini-bar is small but diverse, though I have to warn that room service is limited, in both selections and service times (for those desperate, there is a Starbucks next door if you run into am problems). Also next door is Columbus Circle and of course Central Park. If you want a more upscale experience a drink at a time, go to Bar Masa or the Mandarin Oriental. THere's also jazz at Lincoln Center... in short, if you're looking for activities, research Columbus Circle because that has lots of possibilities, many iconic NY, and it is right across the street. Downsides: The decor and its concept is not to my taste, though I don't think it is wretched. The room service is, as I mentioned, spotty, the lighting is good for an orgy but bad for practical things like getting dressed for an am meeting etc. ALSO: do NOT stay at this hotel on New Year's Eve. It is a terrible choice because 1) their restaurant/bar/social scene shuts down for a staff party at around 8 and all the surrounding scenes are in hotels for the most part and around New Year's they won't let in those who are not guests of the respective hotels. The result? You're out in the cold, no place for a drink at 11:30 on NY Eve. Just say no.But, on the whole, this is a good value, good location, reasonable restaurant. It's not going to have the high service profile that caters to your whims like other places (go to the Mandarin for that), but it is a great choice if you're stopping in, need convenience at a good price.",New York,"LifeofThings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",40,3.0

Its actually on 58th which can be confusing for people who you tell to meet you there.I was recently at a W hotel which has improved upon the idea of boutique (see review of W in Boston). The reason for staying at 6 Columbus is its location. It is a typical boutique in style, which is dark, contemporary and lively, with an overall modern feel. I have been in some boutique hotels that have small rooms, yet they were very functional. I was in room 66 and it was small and very non-functional, Poor task and room lighting, a desk that is unusable and a bed that is sufficient, but with lousy pillows.Room: The room is cramped in a NY style kind of way. It has adequate power outlets. The TV was just okay with a poor selection of channels. There is sufficient (barely) storage, but it would be inadequate for two people. The view is not much to talk about. There is a desk with very poor task lighting and the windows let in very little light. The worst part is that to use the desk you have to sit on the bed and have your laptop sit in the drawer. It is simply unacceptable. The bathroom is small, but otherwise adequate. Location: If you are not staying at this hotel for location then don't stay there. The hotel’s location is near Columbus Circle a block from Central Park. Food: I only had a snack at the bar, but having stayed and dined at this hotel previously I was pleased with the food. The bar is small, but very lively and overall enjoyable. The menu is not expansive and is Asian in nature.rHotel Overall: The lobby is small, but has a nice seating area. The staff is young and friendly. I have stayed at other Thompson hotels and have found them to be better choices than 6 Columbus, though the location is hard to beat. For the money, if you don't have to have a boutique hotel i would recommend staying at the Le Meridien which is nearby.

For a weekend centered around the Tatzu Nishi Discovering Columbus installation and a concert at the NY Philharmonic, the Columbus Circle location can’t be beat. Hotel staff, from doormen to desk staff to houskeeping ladies were unfailingly kind and helpful. The room furnishings seemed nearly brand new, sharp (literally), spotlessly clean, and well maintained. The bathroom sparkled. Great water pressure and endless hot water. Towels were probably some of the thickest I’ve had in a hotel. Bed was comfortable and I actually used the bathrobe provided in the closet (stocked with a small refrigerator, various styles of hangers, a safe, and an umbrella.) And finally, something smelled really nice in the room. I still can’t tell if it was, perhaps, some sort of housekeeping product or if it was, in fact, my own hair from the shampoo provided in the bathroom. But man, it smelled nice!And now… The down side.I opted for the ‘pod’ room on QuikBook ($249 + taxes) and, in a way, don’t regret that choice. As the smallest room type in the hotel, I found the size itself to be just right for a single traveler staying for two days/one night. It was cozy and in such good repair, so to speak, that it was a pleasure to be in the room. an issue at all, and I’ve certainly stayed in smaller hotel rooms in my life.However. As the weekend continued on, I began to become increasingly bugged by having paid, ultimately, nearly $300 for such a small room. It started as I continually walked right into the edge of the platform bed, whose corners protuded into the limited walking space. I now have quite a large bruise on my shin from one such encounter, and I really am not a complainer.It continued as I searched for some surface area on which to rest my phone, wallet, book, and cup of coffee. There were literally no available spaces in the room on which to put anything. The night stands, while sleek and minimal, are so tiny that not a thing can fit aside from what the hotel has already placed there (a phone on one, a clock radio on the other.) What put me over the edge, however, was the space available on the window sill. While one quarter was covered by two glasses and a small ice container (perfectly fine), three quarters of the sill was splayed with outrageously priced chips, candies, mints, chocolates, water, and wine. $3.50 for a Snickers bar (that I have no desire to eat) and I can’t even find space to put my wallet down next to it and its over-priced companions. Finally, interrupted sleep was impossible because of the design of each and every room door on the 5th floor (and, I assume, throughout the hotel.) At first, I thought my neighbors could have taken more care to close their own doors more carefully, as I heard the consistent bang-banging of heavy wood and hardware. But in the end, it is impossible, even with the greatest care, to close those doors without waking up the hallway. As my ‘pod’ room was sandwiched at the end of the hallway between two other rooms, I heard this several times throughout night. Then, I myself created equally loud noise for the neighbors in the early morning as I went for and came back with my coffee. So while there is much to like about this hotel, I left feeling sort of ripped-off and taken advantage of. Like the joke was on me, actually. The larger rooms clearly offer more space, and perhaps have better sound insulation and offer a greater distance from the bed to the door/hallway. I felt that the price/quality ratio for my ‘pod’ was not in my favor this time around.","Cambridge, MA","MAWander</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, MA</strong>",55,2.0

But that is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel.My wife and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in mid September. I am amazed that there are positive reviews on Tripadvisor. It does seem that the hotel draws either very positive or very negative reviews. My view is firmly negative.The hotel is in an old building - presumably a converted old hotel. It should not be considered a new hotel. Thompson seem to have kept all of the narrow corridors and small spaces. It reminded me of the inside of a two star hotel in Paris. Poorly laid out and cramped. There is one normal size lift and then a tiny lift the size of a cupboard. The colors are all dark and the place looks rather cheap.We stayed in a king room the room was still very small - even by New York standards. There was no where to put the luggage bags and the only seat faced the door to the room. You could walk around the bed but there was no other space. The bathroom was very small and the shower was in the bath. The bath has to be the narrowest bath I have ever seen and it was an effort to not continuously stand on the plug. The bath was no narrow that your feet were partly on the curved sides.We woke up one morning to no running water in the room. Apparently there were water pressure problems on the upper floors. It was fixed a few hours later. But I think it shows the limited job which has been done by Thompson to create this hotel.The bed was comfortable - nice linen.There was only a curtain across the window - no sheer, so you had to have the room in darkness or the people in the adjacent building could see in.The room was poorly appointed. The only toiletries were soap and shampoo. No conditioner or body lotion. No ironing board. my wife could not believe the tiny hair dryer.Our room seemed tired even though the hotel is new. It did not appear to be particularly clean. There were several marks on the furniture and one light bulb was out. The air conditioning was very noisy.When I checked out I had to ask if the desk person was going to ask how my stay was. She seemed surprised when I told her how disappointing it was. I have stayed in other boutique New York hotels like The London and The Crosby Street hotel and 6 Columbus is a poor comparison. It is not worth $400 per night. It's rooms are tiny and the building is cramped. I would not recommend it. In hindsight, I should have more carefully looked at the website photos - tiny rooms with basic furnishings and a tiny lobby.

Nice little bar next to the lobby. Also a very cool little rooftop bar, which as of August 2012 was not yet open.We booked same day on HotelTonight and we got a Pod Room for $110/night. For that price any decent and clean room on Manhattan is a steal. So we were happy. Fair warning though - the Pod room is just about the smallest hotel room I have ever come across (though I haven't been to Tokyo yet). It fits a bed with barely enough space to walk around it. If you open a suitcase on the floor, you will have to jump over it to get to the bathroom. The latter is perfectly fine, and relatively not as cramped as the room itself. Props should be given to whoever planned out the room. The little space they have is used well and there is actually quite a lot of storage due to the drawers under the bed.I got a chance to see a Queen room, and it is significantly bigger.

Very good location for visiting Central Park and the Upper West Side or Lincoln Center and the theater district on foot. Good Japanese/Sushi restaurant. But for a pricey hotel , it is missing some basics that we'd expect to have in a hotel in this price range, or even in a somewhat less expensive NYC hotel. 1) No complimentary coffee in the hotel at any time. No coffee makers in the rooms. No coffee in the lobby at any time. Yes, there is Starbucks next door, but we want coffee right away in the morning, and in a hotel this pricey, it should be available in the room or at least the lobby.2) No hair dryer, no iron/board in the room. Does Thompson think people don't use these items enough to warrant them in the rooms? We use them. Yes, you can ask for them, but why aren't they available in the rooms?3) Concierge works very limited hours. She left at around 1 p.m. on both Sat. and Sun. After that, there is a sign saying to see the front desk for concierge serices. But front desk is checking people in and out, and they are not a conceirge.4) No courtesy bottle water in the rooms. Even the Four Points hotels in Manhattan give you a bottle of water. At this hotel, you must buy the Voss water that sits prominently on the desktop, along w/two solid feet of minibar foods and drinks on top of the desk.5) The doors to the rooms are very close to other doors to adjacent rooms (the rooms are clustered together on the floors) and you must pull the doors hard to shut them. This makes a very loud sound when closing the doors. So when your 3-to 4 neighbors go in and out of their rooms, you are going to hear it, big time. 6) No free internet. These are basics for a hotel in this price range, and in fact many lower price NYC hotels offer these amenities. I guess they think it is trendy to have to pay for water, coffee, and internet. We think it is lack of basic services for this price point.","Springfield, VA","eileend10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Springfield, VA</strong>",37,3.0

The Sushi restaurant is also quite good. The rest of 6C is quite disastrous :-( My wife booked a boutique so I wouldn't feel like another business trip. The elevators are slow, and the hall way narrow with tacky blue paint over. For $630 per night, the suite is modern but not functional. The couch & chairs were so uncomfortable we literally couldn't sit through the Olympics. Then came the disaster. The wireless internet did work. The front desk, the IT firm, etc. were ALL consistent about a) apology, b) promise of promptness, and c) promise of resolution. Well, none happened. I asked for an Ethernet cable and ended up going to front desk after 15 minutes. Apparently the PREVIOUS guest also had problem because he/she actually tried to disassemble the Ethernet cable-jack-box to make it work. Turned out the power in the Ethernet port wasn't even turned out. Anyway, I had to go to my one meeting unprepared.We eventually checked out of 6C & into Intercontinental. For $450, the room is much nicer and of course the internet works. But what really got to me was the professionally trained 6C staff who said all the right things but did none of it.

From Brandon and the boys on the bell desk, to the exquisite in-house Japanese restaurant and the simple, yet amazingly comfortable rooms, the edgy and homely feel of the hotel made my trip to New York City.I was at 6 Columbus for nine nights (split into two separate stays). The hotel rewards loyalty. Subsequently when I arrived for the second part of my stay, I got upgraded to a larger room and received complementary snacks throughout my stay.Despite not technically being located on Columbus Circle (really cnr of 58th and 8th), the location is perfect - close to Subway, Central Park, Upper West Side and a short walk to B'way etc. I have already recommended this to a number of friends and family and would not hesitate highly recommending it to anyone else looking for affordable luxury in the heart of Manhattan.","London, United Kingdom","Phil S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

I travel quite a bit and have never encountered a hotel with such great customer service. Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. Here are some of the great points for this hotel:*I am going to repeat it...the staff...they welcome you back warmly. From the bellmen, Peter and Cesar just to name two, and the front desk staff, Adriana and Linda who often give me upgrades, everyone is professional, courteous and efficient. I was quoted in the Zagat hotel edition as saying that the bellmen greet you like you are a 20 year old supermodel even when you are a 40 something high school teacher;-)*The restaurant...Blue ribbon serves incredible food and cocktails. Keith makes the best yuzu margarita but the others make incredible cocktails also. Everyone in the staff is professional and the food is great. I always have dinner there for the dumplings and the sashimi.*The rooms......I always book a pod room. It may be small but it is well designed and the beds are comfortable. There are not too many rooms per floor so it is usually quiet. I was upgraded quite a few times, even though I don't expect it I am happy when it happens, to incredible rooms. They are very clean which is important.*Location...you go out of your hotel and you have subway and bus lines just a few feet away.*Restaurants....many great restaurants in the vicinity*Cons.....I have to leave to come back homeI love going to NY for a couple of days and am lucky enough since I am able to do it a couple of times per year and I don't even consider staying anywhere else now!","Montreal, Canada","cricri7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",61,5.0

STAFF- We were promptly greeted by very friendly staff including the doorman and the front desk person. We arrived very early but they held our bags for us and when we returned later, promptly checked us in and notified us of an upgrade. We also had drinks in the bar and found the bartender staff to be very attentive as well. We also asked for some recommendations from the concierge and were given some great tips. THE ROOMS - The room was very modern, with excellent linens and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean and well stocked as well. the King Suite had an amazing living room with hardwood floors and a separate bedroom. The living room was very spacious even with a little table. Prior to checking into our room, we did look at smoking optional Queen room but declined it bc the prior guest had clearly smoked in it and we aren't smokers which was fine. The Queen room is just as it looks on the Internet, the room is just bigger than the bed by a few feet in each direction with a nice storage closet and a tv. It would have been fine for the two of us for a weekend but cozy for sure. LOCATION - you really cannot beat the location. It's at 58th street between 8th and 9th with the park just one block away and a subway station directly across the street. OVERALL - Given that it is NY, I expected the room to be tight on space and storage but was pleasantly surprised. What drew us to the hotel originally were the great rates ($200 per night for the weekend) but will have us coming back was the exceptional staff and the fantastic location. 6 Columbus just became one of our favorite NYC hotels.","Columbus, Ohio","Travelin_Accountant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",8,5.0

We negotiated a Queen Deluxe room (which was supposed to have 250 sq ft.) and breakfast for about $325 per night. The lobby is small a modern, with a cozy seating area. We arrived a little early, about 1PM and went across the street to the TIme Warner center to shop for a few hours till the room was ready. Even though the staff took my cell #, we didn't get a call and returned after 4PM to find that the room still wasn't ready. After waiting a few more minutes we were able to get into our room. My first impression was dissapointment at the size. I specificlly picked the Queen Delux for the extra space, but this room seemed more like 175 sq ft than 250. Storage space in the room was minimal and my wife and I struggled to find space to unpack our two carry-on bags. The bathroom was adequately large though, and nicely appointed with modern fixtures and black tile walls. The one window had a view of the space between two buildings.Internet access is a pricey $17 per day, even in the lobby, so we went next door to starbucks to get our wi-fi fix. I was also disappointed in the rooftop terrace, another selling feature of the hotel for me. Turned ou that this terrace was about 90 sq ft and had only a sliver of a view toward the park. Both times I went up there to get some air, nobody was around.My wife and I both agreed that the high points of the hotel were the doormen and the breakfast.

With the Columbus circle subway stop right across the street this location was very convenient for getting around midtown. The continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant was free for us (but normally cost $25) and included a very nice fruit selection, granola, yougurt, and juice, milk, coffee.Overall, we felt the room was too small for the price paid, and the hotel amenities were minimal.","Saugerties, New York","stevew424</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saugerties, New York</strong>",7,3.0

This hotel delivers!First, cleanliness--this is my BIGGEST concern when I travel. I cannot stand anything that feels like it might be unclean. At 6 Columbus, my room was absolutely spotless! It was also apparent, by design, that they avoided ""dirt traps"" like carpet, bedspreads, etc. that don't get cleaned regularly, by nature. My room was decorated and designed beautifully with hardwood floors--a REAL treat for cleanliness snobs and germophobes! I wish all hotels had hardwood floors like this one, rather than the dirt-masking darkly patterned carpets most hotels use. This floor gets an A+++ with me at 6 Columbus!The bathroom was also spotless--and tiled floor to ceiling with a gorgeous contemporary feel. I love the black, gray and white contemporary feel of my room with touches of wood to add warmth. The bed was quite comfortable and I loved the freshly washed duvets and nice sheets. I was exceptionally surprised by windows on BOTH opposite sides of my room! Views on two opposite sides? That RARELY happens! What a treat! I could overlook Columbus Circle from my wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling window and peek at Central Park from my office chair... neat! I also had a nice little balcony, complete with chair and coffee table. I've NEVER been to a NY hotel with a balcony like that. Superb!For ladies---you will LOVE the high-end brand, Kiehl's amino acid shampoo and conditioner at this hotel. FINALLY a hotel that gives you ample shampoo and a conditioner that ACTUALLY CONDITIONS your hair! (Instead of that goop that rinses out leaving your hair no less conditioned than before you started.) It was WONDERFUL...to the point I want to go online and see how to purchase more! The service at this hotel was superb. Always friendly, helpful, and they memorized my name within minutes of checking in---and people greeted me by name throughout my 4-night stay. Brandon, one of the doormen, was especially courteous and helpful. They made me feel right at home.A nice, large flat screen TV and a full snack and mini-bar that was stocked well-beyond-mini status was a nice treat when tired feet and long work days extinguished some of my energy for getting to the nearby drugstore for a beverage or snack. The prices at the mini-bar weren't bargains, but weren't total rip-offs, either, given the convenience. For a business traveler, internet connectivity is always important---and I notice at a lot of hotels these days, the bandwidth is severely lacking given the multitude of devices and data-heavy use put upon them in the evening hours. At some points during recent stays, I've literally had to go without internet or tether from my phone as the hotel-provided internet (even for a fee), couldn't support the user demand. At 6 Columbus, the internet, though a bit pricey ($15/day), was rock-solid the entire time. Additionally, they offered ample outlets for charging my multiple devices.I've been a loyal member of the Hilton chain of hotels for years (Diamond level), but I chose 6 Columbus hotel for it's location to business on this particular trip, and it's price (a little less than other nearby hotels), plus other reviews I read about its quality. For me, not staying at a Hilton chain is a deviation from loyalty that I rarely make. That said, whenever I shall return to NYC again, I'm definitely going to consider the 6 Columbus. It's been a true pleasure from start to end to stay here. Thank you, Thompson Hotels, for the excellent service and experience at 6 Columbus. I will definitely consider you again next time I am in NY or another city that has a Thompson hotel. It was wonderful.","Scottsdale, Arizona","psycchic12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",16,5.0

The property reminded me of a stay in a boutique hotel in South Beach Miami.

I enjoyed the first night so much, I asked if they had availability to extend, and they did, so I cancelled the other stay. The location is amazing, at the top of W 58th just as you enter Columbus Circle. It was an easy walk to Times Sq/Broadway and Hell's Kitchen resturants, A subway stop is directly across the street. I was in a king room and did not find the room to be loud from street noise as I have in past NYC hotels. Also found the room size to be bigger than what I normally expect from NYC. Room was nicely decorated, not over the top with a good color scheme. The heated floor in the bathroom was a nice surprise. Be sure to check out the roof deck, it wasn't open for the season for service, but was open to sit and work from, it was a nice quiet ""retreat"" from a busy day of work. As others have mentioned the restaurant is supposed to be amazing, but it was full each night I wanted to try it. People waiting to go in did also rave about the food. The staff can truly make or break your experience, and as mentioned in the opening they were just amazing.

You will stay in a lot of hotels.

APPRECIATED: The hotel offering me free wi-fi as a result.NOT APPRECIATED: That it took talking to two different managers on two days to get that discount taken care of. The first manager offered an upgrade to another room the following day, which isn't really all that much fun when you've already unpacked two suitcases. GREAT LITTLE THING: Heated bathroom tiles! No, really! There's a little knob in the bathroom to adjust the heat, although I couldn't figure out how to work mine. UNGREAT LITTLE THING: No public ice machine, so the doormen would be summoned to bring up ice (requiring a tip in the process)GREAT BIG THING: A nice variety of pillows, both firm and soft, even for a full-size bed.UNGREAT BIG THING: The stairs smelled like vomit. THE BEST THING: The hotel's location, facing the Time Warner building, means that you're about 20 yards away from some fantastic restaurants (including Per Se! Come on!). There's also a Starbucks next door and a 24-hour Duane Reade (and a NY food cart that's open till 3 AM!) on the corner, and multiple subway lines are within two blocks.

Rooms are small but charming in a minimal but comfortable way, great sheets and bath products, etc. My only complaint is a $15 charge for the internet, just can't understand why a hotel with such classy aspirations would stoop to this charge, especially because there's free wi-fi in an adjacent Starbuck's. Apart from that quibble, everything else was fabulous, with very attentive doormen/valets who actually act as concierges, and an obliging front desk staff.

The hotel is in a stark 1960s style with great tile bathrooms. The location behind the Time Warner complex provides access to Carnegie, Lincoln Center, Broadway, and to Per Se and Jean Georges (or to the pre theater $30 something special at Nougatine), as well as Central Park. The staff are really special. Coming back to the room with two cups of coffee from next door Starbucks, the doorman follows me to use his key (the elevator requires room key to operate) because my hands were full! At check out as we come down with suitcases, bell captain approachs and asks if we want storage, has it arranged instantly. As we leave, a very pleasant housekeeper immediately straightens up our room after a pleasant greeting.

(I hope that's not the case and that I'm sensing wrong) I would assume so, because I didn't get one, and I had to wait 8 hours for the check-in and it was my birthday, and they knew it from an email exchange. - The room was cold in appearance and mood (lack of carpeting plays a big role in this)- It looked right into an old residential building just a few feet away; got no sunshine and I had to keep the curtains covered at all times in order not to be face-to-face with the other building anyways...- You could hear absolutely everything from the rooms on either sides, as well as any little sound on the corridor- No complimentary Wi-Fi anywhere in the hotel?! What century is this in? - There was a permanent smell of manure on the corridor of our floorOverall, I guess it was OK... Would I stay there again; not if it will replicate the first experience.",Montreal,"bayimc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal</strong>",34,3.0

We asked for a nice room and we had a great view over to the Time-Warner building, so we could see how the day was shaping up weather wise and just look at all the street life. The room was really quiet. My son was happy as on the sofa bed in the living room with his own TV. All the staff were amazingly nice and the concierge got us NFL play-off tickets at short notice which was hugely appreciated.We love the vibe of small boutique hotels. You feel like you are coming home. The bar is great and the sushi restaurant is brilliant in the hotel.The location is fantastic. My husband would go running in Central Park. The subway is 100m away. The Whole Foods shop in the Time Warner is brilliant to have across the road. That whole place is great actually with brilliant restaurants.The hotel has a great terrace for drinks with fab views.The only downer is the $15 for wi-fi every day.We all have iPads and computers and to log in all would have been a waste but we love our own devices!We had loads of luggage because we were travelling with all our snowboard gear and we had plenty of space.

I have stayed at other Thompson hotels and this was a total surprise at how poor the quality was. The lobby is shabby and tiny, as are the rooms. The customer service is awful, and that was one half of the problem. The main issue was that it was EXTREMELY loud in the hallway next to my room (43) beginning early in the morning. I got no sleep. Finally I called down at 9 am to ask for earplugs. I mentioned the issue for a second time during checkout and was given absolutely no recourse or reason to come back. The girl said a flippant 'sorry!' and turned away. Absolutely surprising and terrible. I have spent a huge amount of money on events, parties, celebrations and nights out at Thompson properties and do not plan to return after this experience.","Geneva, Switzerland","Global_Nomadista</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",10,1.0

Tufted leather banquettes sparsely populated with bursts of bright pillows afford a bit of seating while I wait for my room to be ready. Two complaints of rooms with no heat have already been lodged at the front desk, and as the wind whips by the window this doesn’t seem to bode well. The lobby, fronted by two very friendly door-men, is a balance of light and dark – coolly modern in style, like the rest of the hotel, but warmed by the staff. A sushi restaurant (Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill) is set off to the side, affording a tantalizing glimpse of a light wooden bar. While Columbus Circle is not usually an area in which I’d stay while visiting New York, an online special ($140 a night, before taxes) lured me to 6 Columbus, and I’d heard good things about the parent company that runs it (Thompson Hotels). A slightly dim elevator and hallway, the textured navy blue walls and dark floors eating up much of the light, lead to room #77. Like most New York accommodations, the pod rooms here are on the slightly smaller side of things (175 square feet), so it might be worth it to upgrade to a larger one if possible. The bathroom is more ample, backed by glossy navy tiles and brightly polished Waterworks fixtures. Bolstered by Kiehl’s hair products and white fluffy towels, it is a modern, elegant space, even if an over-hyped Frette bathrobe errs on the side of starchy rather than soft.Above the bed is a large Guy Bourdin print, echoing the proclaimed“60’s modernist” inspiration point for the hotel. The bed itself is comfortable, but not laid out with any top sheets – only a duvet. I’m neither picky nor grossed out about such things, and, as long as the heat was working, didn’t have need for extra bedding. A word about the heat: despite my concerns upon hearing the complaints of other patrons, the heat in my room worked just fine – but it didn’t make it into the bathroom, which was a great deal cooler (not the ideal situation for January). I had to overcompensate in the bedroom to warm the tiled space, but it was nothing a hot shower didn’t fix. On a Sunday night, the room remains pleasingly quiet, affording an uninterrupted evening of sleep. The next morning, as I make my way to the elevator, the unmistakable odor of pot hangs lightly in the air, while knocks and calls of “housekeeping” go unanswered. Another average day in New York has begun.","Albany, New York","Alan I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, New York</strong>",96,3.0

The nice things are: friendly staff from the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping staff to the restaurant. The decor is lovely and ultra-modern. The bed and linens are comfortable and all are clean. The location cannot be more convenient to buses going in every direction and the NYC subway which can be taken to any part of town. The size of the room prohibits any more than the bed, 2 small night tables, a very small closet with a good-sized safe at the bottom (makes it difficult to set your code) and a dresser/refrigerator within one console. The top is covered with all sorts of snacks and other conveniences as well as a complete stock of beverages. There are no vending machines or ice makers on the floor. No sitting area other than the bed nor a luggage rack. The bath is blue tiled with a fair sized shower and very deep sink. The small size makes it hard to bathe, do makeup and get dressed. The door to the bath is opaque class and the mirror over the sink emits a blue light when it is off. The room is not completely dark. It was OK to stay a couple of nights especially if you used the room primarily for sleeping but any lounging must take place in the lobby or the restaurant/bar which is right in the hotel.

This hotel is located just off Columbus Circle, making it very easy to catch cabs to wherever you may wish to go in Manhattan. You can easily walk to Central Park, or Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, etc. The room itself was spacious enough for two people, but the decor was an attempt at 1960s/1970's era styling; instead it looks more on the side of inexpensive, second-hand furniture store. The hallways and hotel room doors are painted black, which makes the small hotel hallways appear even smaller, even giving it a creepy and tenement house feel. The room was extremely clean, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and soft, the shower stall was large enough to not feel cramped, and there was endless hot water available with excellent water pressure to relax after a long day.
