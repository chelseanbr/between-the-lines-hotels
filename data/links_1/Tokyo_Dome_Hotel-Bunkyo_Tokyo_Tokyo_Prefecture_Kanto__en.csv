There is also a stadium for fighting sports such as boxing and wrestling as well as some ad hoc events. So when the big event is happening, everything gets busy from check in, breakfast, elevator, lobby etc.... You might be a bit overwhelmed unless you are part of the crowd for the event. Pro:Though this is a large and busy hotel, hotel staff are still very attentive and pleasant. During my stay of 4 nights, everyone I encountered was always polite, friendly and efficient with smiles. I give a high credit to the customer service manager in this hotel for consistent good service by everyone. The breakfast quality is also very good.

The staff were very pleasant and helpful, and almost everyone spoke a bit of English. And if they couldn't answer my question, they always found someone who could. The rooms were light and bright, and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable. We added the breakfast option and enjoyed both the Japanese breakfast as well as the Western-style buffet on another floor. But bring your own coffee or pop into the Starbucks on the south side at the corner to grab a box of some of their coffee in a little paper filter you can use in your room. Their coffee was about $3 (300 yen) in a package with a filter that fits over the kit's cup, which isn't really a bad deal if you don't want to bring your own. But there was plenty of oolong and green tea for free. They had a money exchange machine for foreign cash exchange in the lobby that had pretty decent rates. So we were able to get yen from exchanging our Chinese money very easily, and it took many other currencies as well. (The limit was a total of 100,000 yen in exchange) We saw there was a game our first day there and we wished we had time to see the game. Range of Japanese and foreign food restaurants were around and a convenient subway stop right at the corner. We walked to Shibuya and Harajuku so we could just see stuff along the way, about 20 to 30 minutes of walking and most other places were around a half hour on the subway. The Jimbocho used book street isn't far (two subway stops on the Mita line that is outside the hotel) You can get a Pismo subway card in the station (for a 500 yen deposit) and travel on all the different subway lines. There are at least three different companies operating train lines and each require their own tickets if you buy them each time. The Pismo card works on all of them, so it is much more convenient. You just swipe it over the blue lit pad at the gate and go in and swipe to go out to have the fare deducted from the money you put on the card. Rides varied on our trips from about 150 yen to just under 400 yen for longer trips with transfers.The hotel is a stop on an airport bus line from both Tokyo airports so it was easy to get there and back to the airport. Around 70 minutes at non-rush hour times. The subways don't have lots of escalators, usually only up ones, but lots of stairs, so taking your luggage on the subway and train is a bit of a hassle. Try to find one of the airport buses to take you into town ands back to the airport. If you are trying to save as much money as possible, then the JR train and subways are cheapest. Next time we go to Tokyo, we are going to stay here again, if they aren't booked up.

Firstly, the location is excellent, right next to Suidobashi station, which has both subway and JR train links.

If you plan to use the underground, the unlimited 24 hour pass costs just 900 yen - great value.Our room was on the 28th floor which gave us great views over Tokyo (and the theme park in the grounds of the hotel). The room was clean and spacious and we had a complimentary iPad in the room to help research our time in Tokyo. There is a bar with great views on the top floor.Opposite the reception area is a tourist information desk, which was very useful.

Christmas decorations have already been put up while we were there in November, with a huge Christmas tree, beautifully decorated at the foyer. We were quickly attended by female concierges and directed to a systematic queue during check-in. The concierge then escorted us to the room with our luggages. There are 8 lifts serving the hotel guests on different floors. The glass lifts overlook the city view and part of the amusement park.We had a room on the 37th floor with glass window overlooking the amusement park so we can see the roller-coaster and ferris wheel. The room is spacious, clean and comfortable with modern décor. Compared to Tokyo standard, the rooms are of an international standard and are more spacious than the smaller rooms in Tokyo. It is no wonder that Tokyo Dome is a preferred choice for international events as a beauty pageant was being held at the premises and beauty contestants were staying at the hotel. It was a pleasant surprise to see beautiful women in the same lift. Hotel guests couldn't help gawking at the beauty contestants and unabashedly requested for photos to be taken with them.We have two choices of buffet breakfast (an international buffet or a Japanese buffet) which is served at two different restaurants. The international buffet at Rilassa dining room has a wide variety of food but it was even more enjoyable as we were dining with beauty contestants in our midst.As it was the autumn season, we took a 20 minutes walk to Koshikawa Korakuen Garden from the hotel, to view the beautiful autumn foliage. It is great that a park is located near to the hotel.There are plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes at LaQua mall and Tokyo Dome City, which are within 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel. Besides the amusement park which has a high-tension ""Thunder Dolphin"" roller coaster, ferris wheel, merry-go-round, Viking, Drop Tower, baseball fans also have a specialty shop as baseball games are often held at Tokyo Dome City.In the evening, lights lit up the Tokyo Dome City area, little garden with autumn trees, the fountain area and surrounding buildings and it was a beautiful sight to behold.Tokyo Dome Hotel has plenty of exciting and fun activities to offer so there are always plenty of things for us to do during our short stay. We would recommend this hotel for its warm hospitality and close proximity to amenities and full entertainment.","Singapore, Singapore","JustinaLee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",117,4.0

The queues can get long. But if you aren't here during a tourist-drawing event, you're fine (note the stadium Dome is next door along with a theme park). When I arrived, I was ushered to the premium/elite line. The regular check-in line appeared to be a 30-40 minute wait. Had I been in that line, I would have cancelled my reservation and walked out. The hotel has responded to similar complaints here simply that they are ""busy"". There are a lot of thousand-plus room hotels in the world that manage a check-in queue without such waits. Same for the elevators, which can be aggravating at times. Even more frustrating is that you can see a whole other bank of elevators on the other side of the hotel that aren't even in use for guests. The hotel could fix the queue problem, but chooses not to.The room is basic. Reasonably clean, but with stains on the bathroom tiles and marks on the walls. My ""non-smoking"" room smelled (a little bit) of smoke. I could easily hear noise from the park in my room.Room is small, but normal for Japan.A/c worked like a champ, though.

Receiving staff for guest was very much cordial and guest friendly. With this one become at ease. Bags, luggage etc are handled quickly. Also room allocation, showing directions of rooms, information about hotel is given in no time and in efficient way. Hotel is having 35+ floor and many rooms. Size of rooms are good enough to have space around bed and room is complete with furniture and spacious. If breakfast is included, then restaurant is very nice with multiple choices for different type of guests coming from different countries. Staff who is attending concerious desks are also very helpful and give the right information. As per hotel policy, they do not provide drinking water bottles hence you have to arrange by self.

But, and this is a big but, there are critical areas that quickly pull the rating back to earth. The language barrier at this hotel is huge--it is not designed for English language visitors. Communicating the most simple issues is almost impossible--can I want to stay in my room after I pay my bill? when will my room be cleaned? where is the bar or restaurant? what are the hours the Imperial Palace gardens are open? do you have a 3 prong plug adaptor (yes, they do)? where will the tour travel agent be in the lobby at 4? Getting these answered is exhausting and frustrating. The restaurants are nice, but not great. The fresh robe everyday is wonderful--a favorite of my wife. The crazy electronic toilet is going to be a story for our grandkids!The rooms are very nice, but even 20+ floors up, there is still audible street noise, the rooms have no night lights (you have to leave the drapes open to have a light to find the bathroom). The TV has no English language stations or news shows. There is no bar open during normal business hours and into the eventing (we have never encountered this situation!) The room cleaning staff is still cleaning occupied rooms at 4 in the afternoon! Finally, the art in the hotel is very small and unimpressive--nothing to catch your eye, but the orchids are beautiful--not big and bold, but very beautiful.This hotel was ""picked"" for us as a part of our travel package. It did what we needed, but it was tough to deal with the staff for answers to questions. In all our travels, we have never had such a communications issue.

I persuaded a sympathetic maintenance many to let me and 9 others go down in the service lift.Queues were a theme in this hotel.

On this five day trip I stayed at the Prince Park Tower Tokyo (highly recommended, the Tokyo Dome Hotel, and some Quality Inn. The latter is basic but a good consistent no-frills budget hotel.The Tokyo Dome is a design failure and the stingiest property I have experienced anywhere so far:Standard Room Design- No charging facilities near the bed. I was offered a long cord I can trail through the room which I kindly denied. The ‘Premium Room’ however features a multi-plug USB combination charging port next to the bed which can be easily provided in other rooms too.- Carpet in the bathroom!!!! Absolutely unhygienic and a health hazard given the opportunity for mold to grow in a damp environment. Only some ‘Premium rooms’ aka suites have no carpet in the bathroom and I was upgraded to such room after one night after my request.Toiletries- The standard room (I paid USD450 for a two night stay!) only provides Shampoo, Conditioner and a bar of Soap. NO BODY WASH! They are also the cheapest kind available. Only the ‘Premium Room’ comes with body wash as pictured. Stingy as hell!Coffee- ‘Premium Coffee’ is provided in the room at a charge of JPY205. No other even instant Nescafe is provided. Complete rip-off and utmost stingy at USD200+ a night.‘Premium Room’ DesignThe ‘Premium Room’ features a remote controlled ceiling light (pictured) operating independently from the master room light switch. The remote is entirely in Japanese and there is no information that it belongs to such light.The room layout and fittings of the ‘Premium Room’ seem to be thrown together with whatever they found. No design thought, taste, nor quality has gone into designing the room. Judge for yourself, pictures included in review.

Usually hotels provide advance or in-room notification of refurbishment works. Hotel Management had no knowledge and only after a ten minutes they found out that there was work on the 34th floor, I stayed at the 36th floor. The 35th floor was also occupied.

What better place to stay at than the Tokyo Dome Hotel? The Hotel was very modern with a nice lobby. Very easy to get to from Narita airport and I'd assume probably from Haneda as well. As soon as we walked out of the terminal at Narita we hopped on a scheduled bus service (about $30) which stopped at the Tokyo Dome Hotel. I believe it was the 3 stop. Check in was easy. No lines. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff. There were probably 10 people working check ins. So while there were quite a few people checking in there was no wait. Also every time you walk in or out the front door there are staff people waiting to help you. There are usually two people sitting at the Concierge desk. We used then daily with questions about transportation, sights, dining options etc. They were extremely helpful. The rooms were nice. Beds firm, but very comfortable. I would suggest getting a room as high up as possible since the views of Tokyo are outstanding. Only thing about the room is that they don't have 3 hole electrical outlets like the ones that you'd need to charge your laptop. This wasn't a problem though. I asked at the front desk and a guy with an adapter showed up at our room in about 10 minutes. Overall outstanding hotel, especially if you're there to see an event or game at the Tokyo Dome.I only had one problem. Tokyo in July is very hot and humid. We would usually get back to the hotel at about 4:00 PM in order to go to the games at 6:00. For some reason the pool is not open on weekdays!! It would have been very nice to be able to cool off by the pool for an hour or two before going back out that night.

However, the air-conditioning is not satisfactory. We tried the lower temperature and maximal wind speed but only a trace of airflow could be detected from the air vent. The window could not be opened so the room was stuffy.Another pitfall is the lack of complimentary bottled water or coffee in the room. The only free item in the room were too packs of teabags.Nevertheless the price is reasonable for such a spacious room so it has earned some points on that.Richard Lau",,rmtlau .,12,3.0

The location and view of the park looked beautiful and the lobby was in excellent condition. Originally my husband and I had booked to come with our daughter but when our daughter couldn't make I emailed the hotel a few weeks in advance just to let them know we would just be travelling as a couple. While I didn't expect a room change I did at the same time request a double or king bed (which I have done many times before at numerous hotels where they often push two twins together for couples). On check-in, the ladies had no prior knowledge of our daughters cancellation until I showed them the confirming email. They then asked about the bed configuration for my husband and I and said we requested one bed. When we got to our room I was shocked to see they had literally just pushed one twin bed over to touch the next. The two single beds were individually made, but now they touched??!... The room overall was very dated for a four star hotel, scratches and marks covering the walls, 80's looking ill fitted chairs and bed covers (one with a stain). The rooms are quite hard to get at the right temperature and as there seems to be a inadequate working fan in the bathroom, the whole room fogs when we shower. On the positive side, the room (apart from the one bedcover) and bathroom is extremely clean and the view is amazing.

I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions while staying in Tokyo on business and the level of service and quality is constantly excellent! Room sizes are generous for a Japanese hotel, although the bathroom dimensions are more typically Japanese but well appointed, so unless you are under 4ft do not expect to stretch out in the bath!The hotel is actually part of a larger Tokyo Dome Complex that includes the hotel, the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Dome City attractions. The City attractions is a leisure complex that incorporates theme park rides, restaurants and an Irish bar. Unlike many leisure complexes the food is typically excellent the drinks unexpansive, should you wish to leave the hotel but don't fancy venturing too far. The centre of the complex is the Tokyo Dome which is a baseball stadium and 50,000 seat music venue! Events at the venue have a big impact not only on the crowds outside the hotel but variation in price. During this stay prices fluctuated between GBP 101 - 164 p/n due to a popular act playing at the Dome. Price wise however the Dome Hotel represents a reasonable price for room size and location. Most people traveling to Japan (myself include) are first pleasantly surprised or even amazed at how everything runs so well to schedule, but remember for this to work you will be expected to maintain the same discipline! Therefore early check in (especially if no forewarning is given) is likely to be refused & check out times are strictly adhered to! Hotel transfer from either Haneda or Narita is simple with the option of either the limo bus or train network which both run like clockwork. Transfer by taxi is possible but expect to pay roughly £140 from Narita and is only marginally quicker. The hotel has two main restaurants for breakfast these being Westerner (ish) and Japanese, the quality and quantity of the food is excellent, but during longer stays can become a little repetitive. With so many local restaurants offering and excellent and varied choice of food I have rarely eaten in the hotel, when I have the food however has been first class and I couldn't fault the Tempura set menu at Yugo-an Tankuma.There are negatives but they are small! Drinks cost at are not insignificant but pricing is upfront and clear, areas of the hotel are little warn and in need of a re-fresh and the efficiency of the air conditioning varies throughout the day. In room TV is typical of most Japanese hotels in as far as you may find an English channel, but then again you may not and if you do you are never quite sure how long it will stay in English. This is a very narrow minded complaint (being in Japan after all) but it’s something you miss especially on longer visits None of these points however are major issues or would give me any reason to think twice about booking again in the future",,Matthew F,13,4.0

Given the cost (£95-a-night double room), I expected very little apart from its convenient location for the rest of Tokyo. The location is great - there are convenience stores within a 2 minutes walk from the hotel, plus many restaurants are within 5 minutes in the Tokyo Dome Park. It is a 25 minute walk to the gardens and parks in Chiyoda. There are quite a few train lines nearby: a couple within 2 mins, another within 10. It was easy for me to travel by subway to Haneda airport (50 mins in total, 1 change at Mita). I knew most of this before booking. However, I was surprised by the attractiveness of the hotel interior, such as the lobby and the bar/restaurants. I also thought the service I received from the staff was superb. For example, without asking I was provided a newspaper at my door in the morning, and staff took my suitcases to my room on arrival in the lobby. I was also happy with the size of the room. My room also had a great view of the Tokyo Dome area (see attached photo). There were a couple of minor things that stop me from saying the hotel is perfect. One is that the room was not as modern as the rest of the hotel. It was acceptable (very clean, comfortable bed, good shower), but certainly you would not expect the decor to look the way it does if you were to guess from seeing the lobby. The other is that the room did not provide facilities to make more than one cup of coffee per day. They charged 210 yen to use the coffee filter for this one cup too. This is not ideal. I would definitely stay again. My colleagues stayed in different hotels, some paid more than me, others paid less, but none of their experiences were as positive as mine.","Hamburg, Germany","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamburg, Germany</strong>",3,5.0

Compared to many other hotel rooms in Japan, the three-bed room was very spacious. Also, the bathroom was rather large and had a full tub, whereas other Japanese hotel only contain a small shower stall for bathing. You'll get a great view of Tokyo from riding the elevators, are they are glass-enclosed. If you're from the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or another primarily English speaking country, most of the hotel employees speak English well, certainly better than I speak Japanese. They were able to help me arrange a ride to Haneda Airport and assist me in mailing a package through Japan Post. In terms of its staffing level, this hotel is very guest-focused. When you enter the lobby, there were always several employees available and ready to help answer questions. Although I'm no expert in the geography of Tokyo, the location felt very central to the city. JR and Tokyo Metro stations are nearby. Also, as the name hints, the Tokyo Dome sports facility is easily within walking distance, as are restaurants, convenience stores, a bowling alley and a post office. A gift shop is conveniently located on the second floor. One possibly negative thing I will say about this hotel is that the restaurants contained with the hotel are rather expensive, though that's more of a comment on the restaurants located within the hotel, as opposed to the hotel itself. If you're going to Haneda or Narita Airport following your stay, I recommend going to the concierge and buying a bus ticket to the aiport. It's about 1,130 yen (11.15 U.S. dollars) to go to Haneda, and about 3 times as much to go to Narita, but still may very well be worth the expense.","Richmond, Virginia","middan94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",8,5.0

The location is easily accessible by subway as it is right in front of the subway station called Suidobashi.Although it was my first time to go to Tokyo, I could travel around quite easily.Another thing that I enjoyed during my stay at Tokyo Dome Hotel is that the food court at Tokyo Dome City which is right next to the hotel and it takes 1-2mins to reach there !I preferred to trying local food than hotel breakfast so I went to the mall.There is a food court on the first floor and the Tacoyaki and rice with salmons on it, which i was told to pour their special soup onto it were super delicious! Other than this, there are a few restaurants you can explore at late night as well.Seven Eleven is just on the way to hotel from the subway so I bought a bottel of water every night as the hotel didn`t offer drinking water for free.Amenities are just ok. you might want to bring your own foam cleanser, shampoo etc.There is an Airport bus that goes to Narita & Haneda Airport from hotel as well.I found it really convenient.My stay at Tokyo Dome hotel was totally worth it !","Singapore, Singapore","jasminekim0617</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",4,4.0

For Americans, you will feel very comfortable in this hotel. You will also feel very large as the Japanese tend to require less space that we over fed American do; none the less the rooms are nice and are comparable to hotels in the U.S. You will find the bed a bit short but nothing that will cause you to loose sleep.In the hotel are several different restaurants that should satisfy the traveler. The top of the Dome hosts a bar seen that if I spoke Japanese and were 20 years younger would be a place I would want to go for night life. I would avoid weekends at this location as each time I was there, local families would arrive with children. I it was kind of like going to the Disney Land Hotel, lots of running up and down the halls and more noise than I wanted being away from home on a weekend.Breakfast! I emphasize this because breakfast in countries other than the United States can be a sobering experience. The Tokyo Dome has as I recall two or maybe three different breakfast menus/locations. You will get close to what is familiar to you in the American dinning room. If you pick the Japanese dinning room, you are more adventuresome than I.There are many places to walk to from the hotel for shopping, small local restaurants and a magnificent park right next door. I should not forget to mention that the name of the place indicates its right next door to the Tokyo Sport Arena. I watched a couple of Japanese Big League games there. You will be able to follow the game as Baseball is international but you will also find real cultural differences in the grandstands. Not bad, just different. My last note of caution, don't order what looks like a hot dog, its actually a fish dog. I watched my good friend almost choke to death after the first bite; I never laughed so hard; stick with the beer, its predictable.","Issaquah, Washington","Skipper3436</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Issaquah, Washington</strong>",42,4.0

There are many (MANY) local convenience stores (7 Eleven, Lawsons ) around the hotels which meant i was able to pick up some instant coffee and milk for those 3am jet lag induced mornings. We didn't spend too much time in the hotel as Tokyo is a city to be explored! But we started our mornings at the breakfast buffet which were large and had pretty much everything a standard western buffet would have (there was also the option of a Japanese style breakfast...however this was served on another floor) We ended each evening in the cafe on the 3rd floor and treated ourselves to one of their lovely desserts and a cappuccino. As we visited in January the pool was not available for use - it would of been nice to have an indoor option or a sauna to relax in after a full day out of exploring this wonderful city!

I was told it was 11am. I then proceeded to ask for late checkout which was granted until 1pm. Imagine my astonishment when I proceed to checkout and my invoice reflected a 8100yen fee for late checkout. I explained that I had requested and had been granted the extension and asked that the fee be removed but the staff rejected my request. At this point, in what I can only assume to be the manager came out to clarify their stance. I reiterated my point to which the manager asked for the name of the staff who granted me the late checkout extension. I was flabbergasted by his suggestion. Which normal person would think to ask for the name of the staff while requesting for late checkout? Ultimately, the fee wasn't waived and I can only say this level of service is not befitting of a 4 star hotel.","Shanghai Region, China","tommyzmac</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai Region, China</strong>",17,2.0

Near 2 stations, but unless you read Japanese and know where you need to go this is not very useful. A taxi would be more appropriate. As others have said, check-in was slow and poor quality service. Extremely busy foyer. Poorly signed. Lots of staff who were not helpful. The room: large (excellency suite) and adequately appointed, but the bed!!!! Awful. Very hard. I thought probably for use by locals who might prefer hard beds, but the Japanese reviews belie that thought. They found them too hard as well. The solution (not quite satisfactory) is to double up the quilt and use that as a mattress topper, turn up the room temperature and sleep above the quilt. This was a very uncomfortable couple of nights and after a 12 hour flight it was not what I wanted (or expected). Staff seemed unperturbed by my observations. Other complaints? Expensive drinks. Even the in-room coffee had to be paid for! And the TV was Japanese only unless paid for. WiFi was free, which is good. No iron. Restaurants and bars seemed to be there for the benefit of the staff rather than the customers (early and very prompt last orders). Even in Excellency floors (40-43, so very high) the noise of the trains was disturbing. At that height why not double glaze it properly to reduce noise? Also, in an area with lots of hospitals and police stations, there were lots of sirens at night. I know, because I couldn't sleep on the hard bed!!All in all, AVOID this hotel if possible.

It's part of a major mix-use development project that features a major league baseball stadium and a full-fledged city amusement park. So all the pros and cons of such project apply in full force.On the plus side, all aspects of convenience are high at Tokyo Dome. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel. Convenient stores, cafe, and nightspots are all within short walking distance. Suidobashi subway station, the closest one, is on the street corner. Korakuen station on another subway line is a bit farther to the north. JR Suidobashi station is just across the street.On the negative side, the hotel is always busy. At all hours, you see people come and go. A large coach dumping a big group of tourists on the hotel door step. Luckily, the baseball season was largely over when we were there, I can only imagine how busy and noisy it would be when the game is on.Rooms are very spacious, neat, and clean.The bathroom is the standard modular one-piece lift-and-install that seems to be the norm these days in Japan. Which is another way of saying that it's functional, but you're not going to have a luxuriating experience soaking in its bathtub. Deco, furniture, bedding, and amenities are all properly accounted for but tend toward practical and of average quality rather than pampering.Taken together Tokyo Dome is a good value. However, there is one caveat.

Room was Western sized, with a very large bathroom. I had a two double bed room, beds were basically single beds so don’t plan to put 4 people in the room. And as others have mentioned, they were Japanese traditional style designed for people used to sleeping on tatami mats. So if you like an extra firm mattress you would be very happy. Although no one in our group was complaining about the bed hardness.They were celebrating that the hotel was 15 years old, and guess what, the room décor is that old. It’s well kept, but it is dated looking. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, had a decent range of Asian and Western items. Right now it appears they are catering heavily to Chinese tour groups, so watch out in the morning as the large groups will all come down at exactly the same time (like 7:30 AM).The hotels is part of the Tokyo Dome baseball stadium/amusement park/shopping mall complex so lots of shops, and there is a Don Quixote about 2 blocks up from the east exit of Suidobashi station by the hotel.For some reason the hotel web site makes you think it’s a hike to get to the hotel. Best method is to take the East exit form Suidobashi station, turn to the left and walk to the intersection and spot the Starbucks across the street. Then look a little bit to the left & look up. The hotel is right there. If you go out the West exit, do the same thing but do everything to your right.About the only big drawback to this hotel is it’s not in a convenient spot for getting around Tokyo for sightseeing by using the trains, and especially from the airport. Even though it’s kind of in the middle of the center of the Yamanote line loop, it’s not close to any of the key areas. And the Chuo line is limited unless you want to go to Shinjuku or Akihabara where you will make transfers. So plan on making a lot of transfers if you are using either JR or Tokyo Metro, or using cabs.

They claimed that the hotel was fully booked the previous night (it was Saturady night to Sunday) and so no early availability was open. Thus I had to wait until 15.00, that is around 5 hours! I managed to wald around for 1 hour, then to have something to eat at their lobbly area and at 12.45 I asked again for their mercy.

The beds are those lower than American standard, extra firm (hard) one that you find in most Japanese business hotels; though sheets and comforters provided enough softness to make it bearable. You get used to it. The maid staff was very attentive and kept everything clean.

The shopping mall across the plaza and stores across the street has all you need for shopping too: Uniqlo, Muji, grocery store, Don Quixote, etc..I would recommend this hotel for business travelers because it is right next to the Suidobashi Station on the Chuo Line.

The station doesn't have any direct lines to Tokyo station, so it's not extremely convenient to get onto the Yamanote line, but it does provide direct shuttle bus services to both airports.The check in and out were done very quickly and efficiently by the hotel staff. The staff are also able to speak English to a certain extent, which may serve as a sigh of relief for some visitors. The rooms are clean and big by Japanese standards. Get a higher floor for a magnificent night view of Tokyo dome and the close by shopping mall - Laqua. Amenities provided by the hotel are the usual, nothing spectacular to rave about. The beds might be a little stiff and the pillows are a little on the shallow side. The Wi-Fi signal is really strong and is more than enough to cover even video streaming.The toilets are huge compared to the usual Japanese standards, and they come with a bath tub and sink, which is quite rare if you were to stay in other business hotels. There are two restaurants that serve breakfasts at this hotel. One is the international buffet spread on the 3rd floor, and the other, a traditional Japanese breakfast on the 4th. The international spread is decent and caters to a larger, more eclectic crowd. However, the dishes don't change at all, so be prepared to be seeing the same dishes throughout your entire stay. The traditional Japanese breakfast is essentially a set meal, but it was surprisingly good. I'm not sure if the menu is changed regularly though. There are several shops in the vicinity that one might be keen to explore. The most obvious one being the large shopping mall - Laqua, which is just a 15mins walk away. There's also don Quixote (something like a large convenience store), 7-11, Starbucks and Macdonald's all close-by. Really fantastic place to stay, despite the minor inconvenience of having to change trains to get to the city or more touristy places.

(Well, except, the towel hanger in the bathroom is very low and literally right next to the toilet, which made the towel hung there seem a little filthy...)But the location is good if not great, considering that a lot of reasonable priced hotels in Tokyo are a little bit far from train stations where as this hotel is right above the subway station, and there are plenty of places to eat around the area, so you won't have to exhaust yourself walking to the hotel dragging your suitcase or simply after a long hard day, get a quick bite, and go to bed.So if you're content to have a flat surface to sleep on, this is a fair choice, but if you want your bed to comfortably support your exhausted body, by all means, KEEP AWAY!!","Osaka-shi, Osaka, Japan","Yorie K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Osaka-shi, Osaka, Japan</strong>",2,2.0

As you can see from pictures, it's a high-rise hotel with minimalistic rooms, yet comfortable and quiet. I was a bit surprised by the somewhat basic rooms as I guess I expected a few more amenities. That said, I was not in the room very much and for the amount of time I spent in it, it got the job done. I was always able to connect to wi-fi, the bed mattress was hard, yet comfortable for me (as I like a harder mattress versus a soft mattress), the room and hallway were quiet and water pressure for the shower was very good. The room itself was quite clean upon arrival and every day after it was serviced.If you are going to an event at the Tokyo Dome, this hotel is a great option as it's right there next to the venue. The location also allows for good restaurant options within easy walking distance of all types of cuisine (American, Italian, Japanese, chain type restaurants (TGI Fridays), etc. The only drawback for me is the TV doesn't have english channels. Unless your Japanese is very good, watching TV is not a good option. After a long day at work, it would be nice to come back and have some sort of foreign (CNN, SKY, Sports) channel available. Not the case here.For the price however, this hotel gives you the basics for a good nights sleep and the ability to get good connectivity in your room. Two key aspects of any hotel room.

I checked-in to room 4109 on July 16.The Dome is convenient because it's a five minute walk to our office. If you're a baseball fan, the hotel is right next door to the Tokyo Dome, home of the Yomiuri Giants. The hotel gets seriously busy on game nights or if there's a concert going on.The dome has 42 floors and a lot of rooms. Prices are reasonable. Location is not ideal as there aren't many sights in the area but it is a short walk to the subway and JR train stations. Convenient.Though old, it still carries a nice modern vibe. Brightly lit and spacious lobby. The door staff and bell team are super efficient in greeting you, taking your bags - storing them if your room is not ready - and seeing you to the check-in counter. They are outstanding.The check-in was longer than i think necessary. And, even if i have been to the hotel many, many times, they never acknowledge me or have my personal details printed in advance. I have to fill in my personal particulars every single time. They must have a seriously outdated CRM system.I settled for a smoking room as it was a last minute reservation and they were running full. It was a good excuse to try their Execellency Rooms (the equivalent of the Executive Floor, I guess). The bad news was they only had a smoking room left.Actually, the room size, bed and bath are similar to some of the non-Excellency rooms except for a fancier credenza and mini bar. The work desk and lounge chair is the same. The TV is also better but the selection of channels is the same...only CNN for English. The pillows are not the usual fluffy ones...flat and hard.The bath in this room is really good sized and very well lit. Complete amenities including a hair dryer. Good water pressure too.If you stay at the Excellency floor, you get access to the Excellency Lounge which is a charming and intimate space. You get a free continental breakfast. Nice. And you can check-out there, too.The Dome hotel is a reasonably good value. As such, it is very popular with tour groups so your patience may be stretched a bit if you happen to arrive at the same time. There could be as much as a 10 minute queue for the elevators.

It was part of a package deal from our local travel agency, so we got a discount. It met our requirements of being near a subway station (near two in fact!), surrounded by malls and very clean with good service. Now, for details:Location:It's walking distance from Suidobashi (JR and Toei) and Korakuen so easily accessible by public transport. Malls and convenience stores within walking distance. However, this hotel can get VERY VERY crowded when there's a show at the Tokyo Dome arena. This happened throughout our stay there with Paul McCartney concerts and Baseball games. The good thing about this is, the crowds are very organized. But a crowd is a crowd and waiting for the lifts became tiring sometimes, especially when we were rushing somewhere.Breakfast:We had a buffet breakfast at Rilassa everyday, as part of our package. We're vegetarians so the food was mostly the same on all 7 days. Limited breads, egg (fried/scrambled/plain omelette), hash brown/baked potatoes, fruits, cereals.. Not much hot food. In fact we were happy to see a tomato-based pasta but it turned out to have pork in the stock. But I think there was a very large variety of food for non-vegetarians.. the menu changed every day too.Service:Impeccable! We felt this way throughout our stay in Japan - people are extremely courteous and helpful!Amenities:We didn't really explore these. But the amusement park next door could provide loads of entertainment for bored kids!Cleanliness:Very clean. No complaints here. Towels were changed everyday.

But make sure to check the bus schedules carefully since they run at specific hours. Otherwise you’ll have to take the trains which is a bit more complicated because you need to change the station or either take a cab for the rest of the journey to reach the hotel. Please consult the Access Page of the hotel’s website which gives clear directions on the matter. Also check out the Airport Limousine Bus facebook for promotional fare packages. There are three main stations around the hotel. From the front entrance, turn left and in less than 5 min walk, passing by 7-11 and Starbucks on the left side, you’ll reach Toei Subway Mita Line’s Suidobashi Sta (A2 Exit) where there’s an elevator for those in need. If you cross the street at the intersection on the right side, you’ll reach JR Chuo Line’s Suidobashi Sta. However if you exit at the back of the hotel and walk through the amusement park and cross the street to the LaQua Complex side, turn left and walk a bit further you’ll reach Metro Marunouchi and Nanboku Lines’ Korakuen Sta. In my experience of using subway stations I’m happy to say that all the personnel took great care for people in wheelchairs. There might be elevators from the ground floor down to the platforms. But at old stations there’s quite a gap between the platform and the train itself, and that’s why we were accompanied by at least 1-2 station staff carrying a portable ramp with them. They led us through to the designated place and notified the destination station of our group. When the train arrived and door opened, the staff would place the ramp down before wheeling me into that car and took a bow; we of course bowed back. We were met with the same procedure at the destination station. If it’s a new station, then only one staff would be there to see to our safety and guided us to the right exit. Japanese hospitality is truly awesome!Tokyo Dome Hotel opened since June 2000 with 43 floors and more than 1000 guest rooms. So you can imagine how crowded it would be at breakfast time. If your room rate doesn’t come with bf, then I’d suggest you book only a room. There are plenty of eateries nearby, plus 7-11 and Starbucks are right next door and across the street is McDonald’s. For other main meals, many restaurants of Japanese and international cuisine are within walking distance, either at the close by Meets Port or further back of the hotel at Amusement Park and LaQua Complex. If walking isn’t an issue then you may get off the front door on the 2nd floor, walk towards the yellow building and cross the pedestrian overpass to the West Exit of JR Chuo Line’s Suidobashi Station. There you’ll find many local eateries that offer tasty ramen at much lower prices. The hotel has many room sizes to suit your needs. My husband and I stayed in a Double room with an area of 26 m² while our children stayed in a Triple room of 33 m². I’d say it’s comfortable enough, neither big nor too small. Our bathroom however is rather compact. All amenities came at one set for each guest; a bit surprised to find soap instead of bath gel. But what I loved most is the Japanese toilet, very hygienic indeed! The Triple room’s bath is a wee bit bigger and better functional; the wash basin area is separated from the toilet/tub compartment that has a lockable door. Storage space for both room types is quite limited. Being an Asian myself and I like to sleep on firm mattress but the mattress in my room is really rather hard. Maybe it’s just this room, I don’t know. Due to tiredness I slept through anyway. My children said their mattresses are not this hard. Perhaps you could request for extra lining when reserving your room.Tokyo Dome Hotel is quite adjacent to the Big Egg or Tokyo Dome Stadium, which holds many big events all year round. The hotel is thus a popular venue for guests attending those events. This causes heavy traffic not only at breakfast buffet, where you need to get in line to be seated, but at elevators as well. The hotel has 8 elevators, with 4 elevators on the left serve up to 25th floor and another 4 on the right serve up to 41st flr. At times, at check in hours (14.00-16.00) there are two long lines for both the left side and the right side elevators. At least one bellboy (bellhop) stands by to direct guests to their elevators during traffic hours. Twice I had witnessed a disorderly scene with new tourist groups who had language barriers and were unfamiliar with queuing system. On the way down from your room, the wait time is about 5-10 min. So consider enough time allowance for the elevator when planning your schedule/itinerary.Need to know:- no free bottled water; you can buy from the near-by 7-11 shop- free tea sachets but coffee is NOT- guests staying on 9th-25th flr and wish to visit friends/relatives on higher floors must make a transfer on the 25th flr and continue with the elevators on the right side- mini fridge: On the eve night of our departure my son got so thirsty and he took a bottle of mineral water from the fridge. Very early next morning he bought the exact same bottle from 7-11 and replaced it in the fridge long before housekeeping cleaned the room. Yet at check out, he was charged for that bottle. I suspect this is a motion sensor fridge so don’t even touch or move anything or else you might be charged at check out.- direct booking at hotel website at least 2-3 months in advance for long stay exceeding two nights might get you a special rate, much cheaper than the rack rate and you can opt to pay directly at the hotel.","Nonthaburi, Thailand","agingduo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nonthaburi, Thailand</strong>",136,4.0

Highly recommend a trip to the 43rd floor at dusk as the sun sets as the view is exceptional. The restaurant is pricy on the top floor but do stop for the view and a cold beverage as the view will not disappoint. The rooms are small but extremely clean. Love the house keeping staff in all of Japan as they do take pride in their work.The Bad: the beds are so hard and very old. I've been visiting this hotel for ten years and am sure the beds have not changed in a decade. You can feel springs coming out by placing your hand gently on the bed.

We were traveling with a seventeen-month old baby so this arrangement was great!Breakfast is continental with Japanese dishes available. As we are vegetarians, we could have salad, fresh fruit together with the usual Western breakfast of cereal and various bread types. If anything, perhaps some cheese would have been nice but that's just a personal request.The staff are very friendly and efficient but this seems a way of life among the Japanese people. Every single one I met has been extremely polite and friendly and truly hospitable. Their demeanor only brings out the best in you. The rooms were comfortable. We were on the 35th floor and had adjacent rooms. Great housekeeping service and toilets were a joy to use. I always feel a good judge of a place is its toilets and Tokyo Dome takes the prize!I will certainly return to this hotel because it is one of the reasons I enjoyed my trip to Japan.As a point to be taken for consideration, the checkout time is 11am at the hotel. I've travelled reasonably widely and this is the first time I've had a checkout time as 11am. Checkin is 2 pm, which is the norm but checkout seems early. Perhaps the hotel could reconsider that.One more thing is that the hotel is right next to Tokyo Dome so it can be crowded with guests who are attending the events at the Dome.

I believe I've had a pretty well rounded experience with hotels in Japan at this point. This was the most expensive out of the 4 hotels during my stay, $200+ US Dollars a night. I was here for a good 3 nights. The amenities, staff, and location were all superb. On my next visit, I would not hesitate to book with this hotel again. It was a pleasure staying here.Cons:-Laundry was super expensive, although extremely well taken care of-Elevators were always in high demand. I never waited too long for one. My issue is with the elevator making pit stops on basically every floor until I get off. This probably isn't an issue the hotel can work on thoughPros:-Very close to Suidobashi station for both the JR and Toei lines-Rooms were cleaned and towels replaced daily-Spacious standard double room-Large bathroom, which I love-Free in-room wifi. I was worried about this prior to my check-in after reading older reviews. Seems the hotel have fixed the wifi issue. Now there's free wifi for EVERYONE YAY!!!! It's also fast-Great laundry service-Souvenir shop with a manicure station inside located a floor above lobby-Lovely wide open lobby-All bathroom toiletries available-Front desk kindly accepted my delivered luggage and brought it up to my room upon my request-Hotel located next to amusement park-Hotel location offers a walkable distance to Akihabara-Kind and helpful staff-Great in-room view even from the 18th fl-Fully stocked mini-fridge-There are restaurants located within the hotel","Boston, Massachusetts","Karen P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",27,4.0

Lots to do outside of the hotel we walked around for a few hours watching people on the rides at the midway and did some people watching at the Tokyo Dome as a Baseball game let out.The bed was low to the floor and hard. One of the hardest beds I've ever slept on. Wasnt neccesarily a bad nights sleep (or maybe I was just really tired after a long flight). Bathroom was big. There was a desk with a LAN internet connection that was pretty fast No wifi but that worked for me. I got what I think was a pretty good deal on Agoda.com for $120 usd for the one night. Train station was close by and we even took the train to Tokyo Disney which we were told would take about 70min but only took us about 45 minutes to get there. Not a bad ride at all.Arrived into Narita then caught the Airport limo bus which was like $35-40 per person USD and took about 1hr.

I stayed for three nights at the Tokyo Dome Hotel, could not have been any closer to the concert and was very satisfied with my stay.First, I found the bus limousine service between Narita and the Tokyo Dome Hotel to be very easy and very efficient. The hotel does a great job in the morning getting you on the bus. My non-smoking room was on the thirty-sixth floor and was very nice. I looked down on the Dome. My room was comfortable, nicely furnished, well maintained and the bed and pillows were not quite as firm as I have regularly found throughout Asia. I had no noise problems. There was a small refrigerator with a min-bar, a safe, a humidifier, an abundant supply of the common amenities found in the bathroom and there was even a scale in the bathroom. There was a kettle in the room but if you used their coffee you had to pay for the coffee. Apparently, the tea was free.The breakfast buffet offered a standard variety of western and Asian foods and it worked for me (the coffee was decent). If you want western branded places to eat they are close by. Inside the hotel there is a Sizzler’s with a good salad bar. And, if you leave the front of the hotel and make a left there is a 7-11 and Starbucks a short walk away. A short distance to the right of the hotel there is a Denny’s. And, if you go out the front and cross the street, just to your left is a McDonald’s. Also, if you go out the front and make a left and then go to the first main intersection and make a right, after you cross the street you will pass a train station and if you keep walking you will find a very nice business district with lots of small Japanese restaurants. If you go out the back of the hotel and keep the Dome on your left and walk towards the roller coaster, you will see a walking bridge that will take you to a shopping mall that also has many places to eat. I preferred the hotel’s bar on the sixth floor (go during happy hour) to the stand-up bar and restaurant on the forty-third floor. I found the staff at the hotel to be very pleasant and helpful.

The bed was solid and poor, the room was very small and had poor sound-proofing. The view was ok (it is much better on a high floor) but couldn't always be seen because the condensation on the window was so bad. The breakfast wasn't great either. However the location is good (even if you don't need just the Tokyo Dome) with good JR and subway access.

What a mistake. I don't know it's because of peak time betw. Xmas and the New Year, when you are traveling you want to feel welcomed. I hope my experience was not typical, but it was very negative.Check In: no smile (not sure it's a culture thing), rushed through my checkin despite no one on the line (7pm). I requested high floor and king bed. But gave me a low floor / double bed and smoking room. I understand it depends on availability but at least let me know. The smoke smell was terrible. I called to exchanged the room, and a guy said ""ooh, smoking room is okay"" and I insisted and then he mumbled something and hung up (first time I was ever hung up by a hotel staff). Well, the ladies who took my luggage and brought me to the new room (24 floors higher now) were very pleasant (only high point). Next day I went to guest service or conceirge, the lady pretended to look for things in the drawer for a half minute as I stood in front of her, then looked at me without saying anything and gave me a ""what do you want"" look. I was going to ask for nearby info and then just ask for a local map. She took out a map and slided it over the desk to me (still without saying a word). I am equally offended and bewildered by this experience at the Tokyo Dome Hotel, and in Japan of all places. I hope this is an unique instance.

This is the most expensive hotel I've stayed at with my daughter, but I thought for our last night, it would be worth spending a little extra for a few extra comforts before a long flight home.Well boy was I wrong...First impressions were great, there's a beautiful lobby, impressive glass elevators that show off the immaculate Tokyo Dome area, check in was good - they promptly took our luggage and delivered it quickly to us in our room.The rooms are a good size for Japan, but particularly Tokyo standards. But that's where the good news stops. The beds, whilst not totally uncomfortable are really quite hard - I do understand some people like firm beds, but of the 4 hotels we've stayed at, these are definitely the hardest. The TV is small for a hotel of this 'class', and the rooms are overall bland and lack character. The walls also seem to be made of paper, you can hear lots of banging, tapping, etc. from other rooms.I did get a reasonable rate on this room, so would have given it more than 1 star if it hadn't taken 3 hours to connect to the internet.The website advertises free wireless LAN and broadband. I have my laptop with me - I was quite happy to connect to the internet with the LAN cable provided in the room, which I did for the first several hours (I was in and out of the room of course). But then it stopped working. I contacted front desk, they sent up a staff member to assist, and another to assist - we just couldn't get connected to the internet again via the cable.I asked for wireless, no they couldn't help me. They apologised but said there was nothing they could do. NOT GOOD ENOUGH! After fiddling around for another 1.5 hours (I really needed the internet!), I called front desk again and suddenly they were able to send someone up with wireless LAN - at a cost of 300 yen!! Now I know this is only a small charge - I was more than prepared to pay it when I first contacted front desk about my internet connection problems - but after several hours I was fed up! I do not understand why when I asked and asked, this wasn't provided earlier!Anyhow, the gentleman who connected me to the internet (in the end) advised it was complimentary, but this hotel is going to have to improve its service standards. This is not how I intended my last night in Tokyo to be.

You'll never worry about not finding your way back to your hotel. It is also within walking distance to one of Tokyo's best restaurant districts, and there are two different train stations/train lines within a stone's throw of the hotel. It is clean, efficient, and just enough English is spoken that you'll not have any real challenges in staying here. On the downsize, the rooms are very typical Tokyo, which is to say they are very small and sparsely furnished with minimal, IKEA-esque furnishings . . . $300 bucks worth of cheap furniture, and a $3,000 Droid toilet that will warm, wash, scrub, shower, and blow-dry your nether regions! I had a very good stay here, but can only give the hotel three stars because (a) the beds are horrible, essentially a box spring and mattress pad, minus the actual mattress, yielding very poor sleep, and (b) the in-room internet is pretty lame considering you're in the land of consumer electronics - your computer is on a very short leash in the form of a small ethernet cable, no wi-fi to be had. apparently there is wi fi in the lobby, but it is an upcharge and not easy to figure out.

Probably the in-room dining menu could be improved since it practically has no options for vegetarians. The absence of a fitness center is another drawback. Two suggestions that I would like to make - always carry cash since a lot of restaurants around the hotel do not accept credit cards and do keep 15 - 20 minutes of buffer time to catch a taxi in the morning.","Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","nishant0710</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</strong>",18,4.0

The area features a Spa and fitness center, a medium size shopping mall and rides and entertainments, not to mention plenty of restaurants and the Dome stadion itself.- Plenty of cosplay action over the weekends.- Staff is kind and efficient.- Transport: The Dome is on top of the Suidobashi subway station and next to the JR line.

Biggest problem is probably that the lifts tend to be crowded during peak time.But who cares? It's a comfortable, fun and exciting place. I'll go there any chance I get.One piece of advise: Book your room by hotel's own website.

I'd say this was the (overall) best hotel out of the 4 I stayed in for several reasons.1. Staff. They were very courteous, effificient, accommodating and spoke English proficiently.2. Facilities.i. They have several spacious conference rooms, 2 of which I'm sure accommodates over 100.ii. They have a very spacious lobby - a great rendezvous point, esp. if you don't know Japanese and you want to meet friends; they'll recognize the place and easily get to you. It has a cafe too.iii. They have a pool but I never got to use it; however, it was located strategically in an upper floor of the hotel and is very inviting.iv. Hotel restaurant; I only tried their breakfast buffet and it was good! A cross-over between modern Japanese and Western food with a very generous seating capacity. Conducive for families, big groups and ""meal meetings"" (i.e. working lunches or over-time work dinners). 3. Ammenities.i. Toiletries, towels (3 sizes), slippers and a hair dryer are always provided for. They are environmental friendly as you can indicate if you choose not to have your towel changed for 2 days or more.ii. They also have a water heater and 2 variants of tea, as well an ice cube container.iii. Envelopes, postcards, a writing pad and a laundry bag are in the desk drawer.iv. Sliding closet with hangars, a flashlight and shoe fitter. Lights turn on upon activity.4. Location. It's surround by almost everything! Beside it is a stadium, a shopping complex (restaurants, shops, arcade, etc.) It's near a train station, a mall and more shops, many of which are open in the ""mornight"" hours.5. Technological services.i. LAN internetii. TVii. Room key cardThe aforementioned reasons made my stay at the Tokyo Dome Hotel a comfortable one. The room was very conducive for R&R after a busy day and served as an ""Fortress of Solitude"" despite it being central to a variety places. One of the down-sides is that there is no Wi-Fiand most shops around it close early.

Depending on the time of day you may encounter a 10 minute wait for an open elevator. Rooms are good size (huge by Japan standards) and the beds are hard. Views on floors 20+ are amazing. The included breakfast (on the 2nd or 3rd floor) is excellent.Location of the hotel is excellent. Getting to the hotel from local airports (Haneda and Narita) is simple with the limo bus. I believe the cost was 3K YEN for a one way and they deliver directly to the hotel. I wish I had time to take in a Giants baseball game but it never worked out. Lots of dining options both in the hotel, around the hotel, or just a 10 minute walk to local street. I found the food options better on the street and the prices were cheaper as well. That said the hotel and dome area is still an excellent dining alternative. Beware the drink/food prices in the hotel bar - very very expensive. Outside the hotel front entrance is a Starbucks coffee and around the corner is a 7-11 to shop for snacks/water/beer/sake/alcohol. The Dome has an amusement park and lots of shopping and dining as well.Two different train lines are just 5 minutes walk away giving you full access of the city and beyond.As a side note the March 2011 earthquake hit the day I checked out. I was stranded at the TCAT bus terminal but had colleagues at the hotel who were leaving the following day. They said the hotel swayed heavily (as designed) but remained safe and that the hotel staff remained helpful and friendly despite the situation.If I travel to Tokyo again I will definitely look to stay at the TKH.","Escondido, California","GoodJava</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Escondido, California</strong>",20,5.0

The Artist's Cafe on the 43rd floor was my favourite - the staff were incredibly friendly, the food was great and the cocktails were even better. We also frequently visited Rilassa - I found this slightly misleading as it is described as an Italian restaurant, and there is very little Italian food available, but they do a very good breakfast and a generous buffet serving a variety of Asian food.We were lucky to find this hotel while it was on sale, as it was outside what we could normally afford.

Staff efficiency is very good, from the moment we check-in, till we check-out and even the concierge service. Rooms are clean and well furnished, I like the free internet in the room which keeps me connected to my love ones after a full day meeting. Rooms are spacier than Hong Kong hotels too. The location itself is not bad. There's the LaQua complex just across which is where you would take the Tokyo Metro. You can find food here very easily. There's also the LaQua plaza which offers more choices (if you speak Japanese that is...) and the pricing would be better than eating in the hotel of course. The hotel is not far from Tokyo station which is near the CBD and very near to Ikebukuro which is a large shopping district. If you'd like to go to Disneyland, you'll have to go from Tokyo station anyway. But going to Asakusa is far..... Nevertheless, the theme park below the hotel transforms to a myriad of colours at night. An absolutely joyful place for photographers.

I had a room on the 33rd floor. The room was large; a very good size with a big, comfortable bed, and had a breathtaking view over Tokyo.Service was OK -- as you would expect for this standard of hotel. Professional with good English.The location is very convenient with easy access to the Suidobashi JR and subway stations. However it is part of the Tokyo Dome concert hall / amusement park complex, with is not really my idea of a ""nice"" or restful location.Ultimately I was a little underwhelmed with my overall experience.- the hotel is enormous; more like a city within a city, including overpriced souvenir shops and wedding photo galleries. Not really my scene, but that is personal preference.- the lifts are impressive glass affairs with wonderful, vertigo-inducing views. But they are s.l.o.w., and when they do finally arrive, the doors slam shut on you before you can struggle in with your suitcases.- only wired internet access: no in-room wi-fi.- Mineral water is charged (and 2x the going rate). I'm accustomed to hotels providing at least a couple of free bottles. No excuse for a hotel at this price point.- No iron or trouser press in room; I had to call housekeeping for them. (there was no problem communicating though, and they came quickly. But it's not exactly convenient).Overall, the experience was O.K., but a hotel of this size is always going to be a bit of an impersonal affair. And it was. Prior to checking in at the Dome, I stayed in the Hotel Niwa, nearby. Niwa was significantly cheaper and had smaller rooms, but I much preferred staying there. Cleaner, more modern, and better service and facilities I needed. Moving into the Dome was a bit of a disappointment after that.","Shanghai, China","John W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",11,3.0

We had a triple room, which was just a twin room with an extra bed wedged in. I later went back and stayed in the normal twin room and it was really roomy. The colors and lighting are really soft and relaxing, and it's so quiet. The view from the upper floors is fantastic, so try to request something high up. In the winter you can see Mt. Fuji, so request that side of the hotel if you are going in winter or early spring. The bathrooms are spacious and have the high tech washlets, if you're into full service toilets. There is a minibar in the room, but it's expensive, like everywhere else in the world, so it's cheaper just to buy stuff at the convenience store and store it in the fridge. We went to Akihabara (4 minutes away on the subway) and bought some dvd's (I live in Japan, so region coding doesn't matter). When we got back to the hotel, we called and asked for a dvd player, less than 5 minutes later, there was a polite employee in our room attaching it for us. He gave a quick overview of the buttons on the remote (written in Japanese) and bowed and left. There was no charge for the dvd player rental.

The hotel is just a few minutes walking distance from 4 train/subway stations. Suidobashi (JR Sobu line), Suidobashi (Mita line), Kasuga (Mita & Oedo lines), and Korakoen (Marunouchi & Namboku lines). Using the trains and subway is easy, especially if you get a “suica” card. The card is good on all Tokyo trains and subway lines. It was our first trip to Tokyo and we had no problems getting around the city by rail only. We never had to ride a bus or taxi. My only (very minor) complaints: 1) The carpet in our room, although very clean, was showing wear and tear, along with a lot of little stains, and the hallway carpet on our floor was bunched up in spots from the room cleaning carts. 2) The elevator service is slow at times. Avoid the elevators during peak check-in times and after events at the Tokyo Dome let out (there are signs that warn of up to 30 minute waits after Dome events). A couple of times, we waited probably 5-7 minutes for an elevator even though it appeared to be a slow time at the hotel. So as you can see, my complaints are very minor issues.A couple tips:If you don’t smoke, be sure to reserve a non-smoking room. I believe under 10% of the rooms in the hotel are non-smoking. Luckily, we got a non-smoking room.Be sure to take a laptop with you and use the in-room data access. I didn’t, and had to use the “100 Yen for 6 minutes” computer in the lobby area. There are only 2 of them in the business center and there were a couple times when there were people waiting for me to get done.I would love to stay at the Tokyo Dome Hotel the next time we travel to Tokyo!","Billings, Montana","mtpiper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Billings, Montana</strong>",27,5.0

On top of it all, this hotel is very affordable, much more so than any hotel of this category in any major city, be it New York, London or Rome. In fact, it is half the price of a hotel of the same quality in either one of the cities mentioned. Mine was a business trip, but I'd recommend this for a vacation as well. But do learn some japanese, because english is almost useless in Japan.",Rio de Janeiro,"Frederico N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>",308,4.0

Just press a button on the phone. The hotel store has all of your basics as well as souvenirs and a nail salon.

Airport shuttle is available for about $30.00 USD to Narita, which is reasonable considering it is almost a 2 hour ride.The only drawbacks are minimal. The room service menu is limited.
